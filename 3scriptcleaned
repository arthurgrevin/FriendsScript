Joey  I'm tellin' ya that girl totally winked at me.
All  Did not, she did not wink at you...(sees that their sacred couch is
occupied by strangers).
Chandler  Huh. (They all leave, dejected)
[Scene  Rachel and Monica's, Phoebe, Ross, and Rachel are eating breakfast.]
Ross  I have to say Tupolo Honey by Van Morrison.
Rachel  Nooo Way! The most romantic song ever is The Way We Were.
Phoebe  See, I-I think that one that Elton John wrote for, um, that guy on Who's
The Boss.
Rachel  What song was that, Pheebs?
Phoebe  (singing) Hold me close, young Tony Dan-za.
Phoebe  Hi Monica!
Ross  Hey Mon!
Rachel  Hey Mon!
Phoebe  Oh my God, has she slept at all?
Ross  Nope.
Rachel  No, it's been three nights in a row.
Ross  Yeah, she finally stopped crying yesterday, but then she found one of
Richard's cigar butts out on the terrace, so.
Phoebe  Oh, okay that explains it. I got a call at two in the morning, but all I
could hear was, like, this high squeaky sound, so I thought okay its like a mouse or a
opossum. But then I realized where would a mouse or a opossum get the money to make the
phone call.
[Scene  Chandler and Joey's, Joey is coming in from the bedroom]
Chandler  Morning.
Joey  Morning, hey, you made pancakes?
Chandler  Yeah, like there's any way I could ever do that.
Janice  (entering and singing) Monica and Rachel had syrup, now I can get my man
to cheer up. (laughs hysterically) Good morning Joey.
Joey  (sarcastically) Good morning.
Chandler  Hey, you know what, here's a thought. Why don't you stay home from
work today and just hang out with me.
Janice  Oh, I wish. Look, honey, you have that report to finish, and I gotta go
see my lawyer.
Chandler  I can not believe that I am going out with someone that is getting
divorced. I'm such a grown up.
Janice  (laughs) I-I-I gotta go, I gotta go. Okay, not without a kiss.
Chandler  Well, maybe I won't kiss you, and then you'll have to stay.
Joey  (under his breath) Kiss her! Kiss her!
Janice  I'll see you later, sweetie. Bye Joey.
Joey  B-bye Janice. So when ya' dumpin' her.
Chandler  Nope, not this time.
Joey  Come on, quite yankin' me.
Chandler  I'm not yanking you.
Joey  This is Janice.
Chandler  Yeah, I know. She makes me happy.
Joey  Okay. All right. You look me in the eye and tell me, without blinking,
that you're not breaking up with her. No blinking.
Chandler  (looks him in the eye) I'm not breaking up with her! (they stare at
each other for a while, then Joey blows in his face)
[Scene  Rachel and Monica's, Monica is entering from the bathroom.]
Monica  God, look what I found in the drain.
Rachel  What?!
Monica  It's some of Richard's hair! (holds it close to Ross) What do I do with
this?
Ross  Getting it away from me would be job one.
Monica  It's weird, but you know what I don't wanna throw this away. I mean this
is like all I have left of him, gross, drain hair. Ooh! (drops it in Ross's cereal)
Phoebe  Ooh. Oh. It looks like, like a tiny little person drowning in your
cereal. (Ross gives her this look, like 'Yeah, doesn't it', and gets up to dump it down
the drain.)
Monica  God, what is wrong with me.
Ross  You need to get some sleep.
Monica  I need to get some Richard.
Rachel  Monica, you broke up with him for a reason.
Monica  I know, I know. I'm just so tired of-of missing him. I'm tired of
wondering why hasn't he called. Why hasn't he called!
Phoebe  Maybe, because you told him not to.
Monica  What are you the memory woman?
Joey  (entering) Their not breaking up. Chandler and Janice. Their not breaking
up. He didn't blink or anything.
Rachel  Well, you know I'm not surprised. I mean have you seen them together,
they're really cute.
Joey  Cute! This is Janice! You remember Janice?
Rachel  Yes, Joey, I remember, she's annoying, but you know what she's-she's his
girlfriend now. I mean what can we do?
Joey  There you go! That's the spirit I'm looking for! What can we do? Huh? All
right who's first? Huh? Ross?
Ross  Well I'm thinking that Chandler's our friend and Janice makes him happy,
so I say we just all be adult about it and accept her.
Joey  Yeah, we'll call that Plan B. All right?
[Scene  Ross's bedroom, Ross is working and Rachel is reading a book in bed]
Rachel  (she leans over and kisses him on the cheek) Honey, I was wondering....
Ross  Hmm?
Rachel  Do you still have that, um, Navy uniform?
Ross  Nooo, I had to return it to the costume place.
Rachel  Hmm.
Ross  I think I have an old band uniform from high school.
Rachel  You remember not having sex in high school, right?
Ross  Yeah.
Rachel  Well honey, what about you?
Ross  What?
Rachel  I mean do you have any fun, you know, fantasy type things?
Ross  No.
Rachel  Come on you gotta have one!
Ross  Nope.
Rachel  Ross, you know what...
Ross  What?
Rachel  ...if you tell me, I might do it.
Ross  Okay, umm. Did you ever see, um, Return Of The Jedi?
Rachel  Yeah.
Ross  Do you remember the scene with, um, Jabba the Hut? Well Jabba had as, as
his prisoner, um, Princess Leia.
Rachel  Oooh!
Ross  Princess Leia, was wearing this, um, gold bikini thing. It was pretty
cool.
[Scene  Central Perk, Phoebe and Rachel are there]
Phoebe  Yeah, oh, Princess Leia and the gold bikini, every guy our age loved
that.
Rachel  Really!
Phoebe  Um, um. It's huge. Yeah, that's the moment, when-when, you know she
stopped being a princess, and became, like, a woman, you know.
Rachel  Did you ever do the-the Leia thing?
Phoebe  Oh, yeah, um-mm. Oh!
Rachel  Really! That-that great huh?
Phoebe  No it's just that I got this new pager and I have it on vibrate. See ya!
Ross  (entering with Monica in tow) Hey!
Rachel  Hi you guys!
Ross  Look who I found standing outside of the Szechwan Dragon staring at a
parking meter.
Rachel  Mon. Hi!
Monica  Hi.
Rachel  Why aren't you at work?
Monica  Oh, they-they sent me home.
Rachel  Why?
Monica  Because I don't work at the Szechwan Dragon.
Ross  Okay.
Rachel  You really, really need to get some sleep, honey.
Monica  I know I do.
Ross  Hi.
Rachel  Hi.
Ross  Guess what?
Rachel  What?
Ross  They published my paper.
Rachel  Oh, really, let me see, let me see.
Phoebe  Rach, look! (she holds two buns up to her ears to make her hair look
like the Princess Leia 'do.) Oh, hi! Where is my strong Ross Skywalker to come rescue me.
(Ross stands up horrified) There he is.
[Scene  Chandler and Joey's, Joey is watching Wheel of Fortune, the puzzle is showing
_oun_ Rush_ore.]
Chandler  Hey!
Joey  Wheel!
Chandler  Of!
Joey  Fortune! This guy is so stupid. (yelling) It's Count Rushmore!!
Chandler  You know, you should really go on this show. All right, listen, I got
three tickets to the Rangers tonight. What'd ya' say?
Joey  I say, 'I am there!' Cool! Aw, is Ross going to?
Chandler  No, Janice.
Joey  Jan-ice. 'Cause I, just, I feel bad for Ross, you know, we-we always go
together, we're like the three hocke-teers.
Chandler  You know, I may be way out on a limb here, but do you, do you, have a
problem with Janice?
Joey  No, Yeeees. God, how do I say this. (walks into the kitchen, Chandler
follows closely, he turns around and gets startled). Oh, hi, you know that girl from the
Greek restaurant with the hair (holds his hands up to signify she has big hair)?
Chandler  Ooh, that girl that I hate, eww, drives me crazy, eww, eww, oh!
Joey  Look, I don't hate Janice, she's-she's just a lot to take, you know.
Chandler  Well, there you go.
Joey  Oh, hey. Come on man, don't look at me like that, she used to drive you
nuts before too, remember?
Chandler  Well, I'm crazy about her now. I think this could be the real thing.
Capital 'R'! Capital 'T'! (Joey stares at him) Don't worry, those are the right letters.
Joey  Look, what do you want me to say?
Chandler  I want you to say that you like her!
Joey  I can't. It's like this chemical thing, you know. Every time she starts
laughing, I just wanna (grimaces and tenses up) pull my arm off just so that I can have
something to throw at her.
Chandler  Thanks for trying. (grabs the ticket and starts to leave) Oh, and by
the way there is no Count Rushmore!
Joey  Yeah, then-then who's the guy that painted the faces on the mountain?
(Chandler gives him a look like 'You stupid idiot!')
[Scene  Monica and Rachel's, Rachel and Ross are entering]
Ross  How could you have told her?
Rachel  Ross, I didn't think it would that big of a deal.
Ross  Oh, she didn't think it would be that big of deal.
Rachel  Okay, who are you talking to when you do that?
Ross  Look, that was supposed to be like a private, personal thing between us.
Rachel  Okay, Ross, Phoebe is my girlfriend, okay, we tell each other
everything. You know, I mean, come on, guys do the same thing, I mean, what about all that
locker room stuff.
Ross  That's different, okay. That's like, uh 'Who dated a stripper?' or 'Who
did it on the back of the Staton Island Ferry?'.
Rachel  Were both of those Joey?
Ross  Yeah. Look, you don't, you don't talk about like, you know, your
girlfriend and the intimate stuff you, you do with her.
Rachel  Not even with your best friend.
Ross  Noo!
Rachel  That is so sad. Your missing out on so much, Ross. I mean, the bonding
and the sharing, you know. And-and knowing that someone else is going through the same
thing you are.
Ross  Hmph. So what you, you tell each other everything?
Rachel  Pretty much.
Ross  Did you talk about the night of five times? Do you tell people about the
night of five times?
Rachel  Uh, honey, yeah that was with Carol.
Ross  I know, but it's still worth mentioning, I think.
[Scene  Monica's bedroom, Phoebe is trying to relax her.]
Phoebe  ( in a soothing voice) Relax every muscle in your body. Listen to the
plinky-plunky music. Okay, now close you eyes, and think of a happy place. Okay, tell me
your happy place.
Monica  Richard's living room, drinking wine.
Phoebe  All right. No, no, no, not a Richard thing, just put down the glass. And
get out!
Monica  I'm sorry, but that's my happy place.
Phoebe  Well, okay, fine, use my happy place. Okay, I'm just gonna, I have to
ask that you don't move anything.
Monica  All right, I'll try not to.
Phoebe  Okay, all right, so, your in a meadow, millions of stars in the sky....
Monica  Do you think breaking up with him was a huge mistake?
Phoebe  All right, there are no questions in the happy place. Okay, just, the
warm breeze, and the moonlight flowing through the trees....
Monica  I'll bet he's totally over me, I'll bet he's fine.
Phoebe  All right, betting and wagering of any kind, are, I'm sure, not
permitted in the happy place. Okay. Just-just, you know, the-the lovely waterfalls, and
the, the trickling fountains. And the-the calming sounds of the babbling brook....
Monica  Okay, this isn't working. I'm still awake and now I have to pee.
[Scene  Chandler and Joey's]
Janice  So, I hear, you hate me!
Joey  I, ah, I never said hate, I was very careful about that.
Janice  A little birdie told me something about you wanting to rip your arm off
and throw it at me.
Joey  And you got a 'hate' from that?! Your taking a big leap there...
Joey  But what does that gonna do...
Janice  For Chandler!
Joey  Okay. I'm in.
Joey  Does it have to be a whole day?
Janice  Yes, because that's how long it takes to love me.
Joey  Yeah, I know, I sleep in the next room.
[Scene  Central Perk, Rachel and Monica are entering]
Monica  (crying) So, I went down to the post office, and it turns out it was
those videos that I ordered for Richard about the Civil War. He loved the Civil War.
Phoebe  Monica, do you want us to take you home?
Monica  Uh, huh. (to Ross) Or maybe to a galaxy far, far away. (Rachel, Monica,
and Phoebe leave)
Ross  Women tell each other everything. Did you know that?
Chandler  Umm, yeah.
Ross  No Chandler, everything! Like stuff you like, stuff she likes, technique,
stamina, girth....
Chandler  Girth? Why, why, why, wh-why, why, why, why would they do this?
Ross  Rachel says sharing's great and supposedly, you know, we outta be doing
it. Do you wanna?
Chandler  We're not gonna talk about girth are we?
Ross  Nooo!
Chandler  Yeah, okay.
Ross  Yeah?
Chandler  Yeah! All right! You go first.
Ross  Okay, okay, I'll go first.
Chandler  Okay.
Ross  So, uh, the other night Rachel and I are in bed talking about fantasies,
and I happened to describe a particular Star Wars thing....
Chandler  Princess Leia in the gold bikini.
Ross  Yes!
Chandler  I know!
Ross  Yes! Wow, well, that-that was easy. Okay, you-you go.
Chandler  Okay.
Ross  Okay.
Chandler  Okay, you know, you know when your in bed, with a woman.
Ross  Hmph.
Chandler  And, ah, you know, your fooling around with her. And you get all these
like, mental images in your brain, you know, like Elle MacPherson, or that girl at the
Xerox place....
Ross  With the belly-button ring? Oh, muhawa!
Chandler  I know, And then all of the sudden your Mom pops into your head. And
your like 'Mom, get outta here!' You know, but of course, like, after that you can't
possibly think of anything else, and you can't, you know, stop what your doing. So it's
kinda like, you're, you know. You know...(Ross just stares at him). You don't know!
Ross  Your Mom, your telling me, your telling me, about your Mom, what is the
matter with you?
Chandler  You said...
Ross  I said 'share' not 'scare'. Go sit over there! (Chandler
goes over and sits at a table and puts his head down).
[Scene  Chandler and Joey's, Joey and Janice are returning from their DAY OF FUN!]
Janice  We're baack!
Joey  Hey!
Chandler  What are you guys doing together?
Janice  Joey and Janice's DAY OF FUN!!! (laughs)
Chandler  Really.
Joey  Yeah, yeah. We went to a Mets game, we got Chinese food, and you know, I
love this woman. You have got competition buddy.
Janice  I just came by to give you a kiss, I have to go pick up the baby, so.
I'll see you later sweetheart, you too Chandler. (laughs)
Chandler  You still can't stand her can you?
Joey  I'm sorry man, I tired, I really did.
Chandler  Well, you know, I appreciate you giving it a shot.
Joey  But, hey, look, you know the good thing is, is that we spent the whole day
together and I survived, and what's even more amazing, so did she. It was bat day at Shea
Stadium.
Chandler  Well, I guess that's something.
Joey  No man, that's huge! Now, I know I can stand to be around her, which means
I get to hang out with you, which is kinda the whole point, anyway.
Chandler  Okay.
Joey  Oh, hey, Chandler, we, ah, we stopped by the coffee shop and ran into
Ross.
Chandler  Oh God!
Joey  Hey, if it makes you feel any better, I do it too.
Chandler  Really?
Joey  Oh yeah, I always picture your Mom when I'm having sex.
[Scene  Rachel and Monica's, Monica is watching the Civil War videos]
Monica  Hi, Dad, what are you doing here?
Mr. Geller  Well, it's your mother's bridge night so I thought that I would come
into the city for a little Monicuddle. (hugs her) Since when did you start smoking cigars?
Monica  I don't, I just, I just like the smell of them. So, uh, what are you
really doing here Dad?
Mr. Geller  Well, I just wanted to make sure you were okay.
Monica  What makes you think that I might not be okay?
Mr. Geller  I saw Richard.
Monica  Oh.
Mr. Geller  So, how are you doing?
Monica  I'm fine, just a little tired, I'm okay. How's Richard doing?
Mr. Geller  You don't wanna know.
Monica  No, I really, really do.
Mr. Geller  Well, he's doing terrible!
Monica  Really!
Mr. Geller  Worse than when he broke up with Barbara.
Monica  You're not just saying that are you?
Mr. Geller  No, the man is a mess.
Monica  Was he crying?
Mr. Geller  No.
Monica  Well, do you think he was waiting 'til after you left, so he could cry?
Mr. Geller  Maybe.
Monica  I think so.
Mr. Geller  Honey, relationships are hard. Like with your Mom and me. You know
after we graduated college we broke up for a while. It seems her Father, your Grandfather,
wanted her to travel around Europe, like he did. Of course, he got to do it on Uncle Sam's
nickel, because he was also strafing German troop trains at the time. However, (turns
around and sees that Monica is sleeping and puts a blanket around her, kisses her, picks
up the cigar, and starts watching the video)
[Scene  Ross's bedroom, Ross is humming the Star Wars theme. Rachel enters, with her
hair done up like Princess Leia's, and wearing a belly dancer's outfit, to simulate the
gold bikini thing.]
Rachel  Okay, here we go. I'm Jabba's prisoner, and you have a really weird look
on your face. What? Honey, what is it? Did I get it wrong? Did I get the hair wrong? What?
Did you just picture it differently? What? What?
Ross  No, no it's, um, it's not you, um, it's um, it's (turns and sees his Mom
standing where Rachel is)
Mrs. Geller  Well what is it? Come on sweetie, your like, freaking me
out here.
Ross  I hate Chandler, the bastard ruined my life. (Rachel starts looking around
and down, with a 'What the hell is going on?' look on her face.)

[Scene  Chandler and Joey's, Chandler is sitting reading a book and hears the bed in
Joey's room creaking, and does a 'Oh no, not again' look on his face.]
Joey  (from bedroom) WHOAA!!
Chandler  (going to the bedroom) See Joe, that's why your parents told you not
to jump on the bed.
[Scene  Monica and Rachel's, Ross and Rachel are entering]
Monica  Hey, look at me. I'm making jam, been at it since 4 o'clock this
morning.
Ross  Where'd you get fruit at four in the morning?
Monica  Went down to the docks. Bet ya didn't know you could get it wholesale.
Rachel  I didn't know there were docks.
Joey  Hey.
Chandler  Hey.
Ross  Aww, is it broken?
Joey  No, I gotta wear this thing for a couple weeks. (points to the sling he is
wearing)
Rachel  Did you tell the doctor you did it jumping up and down on your bed?
Joey  Nooo. I had a story all worked out but then Chandler sold me out.
Chandler  Well, I'm sorry Joe. I didn't think the doctor was gonna buy that it
just *fell* out of the socket.
Joey  What is this? Fruit?
Rachel  Monica's making jam.
Joey  Whoa, jam! I love jam! (to Chandler) Hey, how come we never have jam at
our place?
Chandler  Because the kids need new shoes.
Monica  I'm going into business people. I'm sick and tired of being depressed
about Richard. I needed a plan, a plan to get over my man. What's the opposite of man?
Jam. (sees Joey trying some jam from the pot) Oh Joey don't! It's way to hot. (Joey
realizes this and spits what he had in his mouth back into the pot.)
Joey  This will just be my batch.
[Scene  Street, Phoebe is being followed by some guy, as they pass a flower vendor.
Phoebe turns around and the guy quickly picks up some flowers and continues following
her.]
Phoebe  (turns around) Um, that's it. No. Hey! You! J. Crew guy. Yeah. Why have
you been following me? I mean, all week long everywhere I look there's you.
Guy  You wouldn't return my calls, you sent back my letters....
Phoebe  What?
Guy  One more chance Ursula, please?
Phoebe  Oooh. Oh, well this is awkward.
Guy  Wh..
Phoebe  Um, yeah, you want Ursula, and I'm Phoebe. Twin sisters! Seriously.
Guy  Oh, that's great. I'm stalking the wrong woman. I am such a dingus!
Phoebe  Oh, you're not a dingus.
Guy  I just, I want you to know I didn't used to be like this. Before I meet
your sister I was like this normal guy who sold beepers and cellular phones.
Phoebe  Well, I mean look it's, it's not your fault, you know. I mean this is
just what, what she does to guys, okay.
Guy  Well thanks. (starts to leave)
Phoebe  Wait, (grabs him) you know what, I got a little story. When I was in
Junior High School I went through this period where I thought I was a witch. And there was
this guidance counselor who said something to me, that I think will help you a lot. He
said okay, 'you're not a witch you're just an average student.' See what I'm saying?
Guy  Not really.
Phoebe  Um, well, get over it. So, I mean you, you just seem to be a really nice
guy, you know. Don't be so hard on yourself okay.
Guy  Wait. You're right. I know you're right. And, thanks for being so nice.
Here (gives her the flowers he bought.)
Phoebe  Oh, thanks a lot. Do you want to get a cup of coffee?
Guy  Yeah, okay.
Phoebe  Okay. (they start to leave, he is still following her) Okay, you don't
have to walk behind me any more.
Guy  Sorry.
[Scene  Monica and Rachel's, Ross and Rachel are entering]
Rachel  Mon?
Ross  Mon?
Rachel  (reading) 'Gone for more jars. Back later. Monica Geller.'
Ross  Wait a minute, look.
Rachel  What?
Ross  Look, look, look.
Rachel  What, what, what?
Ross  It's an empty apartment.
Rachel  Oooh.
Ross  We're all alone in an empty apartment.
Rachel  Honey, come on, I have to be at work in like ten minutes (Ross starts
kissing her neck) Oh, all right, well it's not like I'm employee of the year or anything.
(they fall onto the couch)
Ross  There it is.
Rachel  Oh, oh, that's what you're talking about. (to Chandler) Hey.
Ross  Hey.
Chandler  Do I look fat?
Ross and Rachel  Noo.
Chandler  Okay, I accept that. When Janice asked me and I said no, she took that
to mean that I was calling her a cow.
Rachel  Okay, walk us through it, honey, walk us through it.
Chandler  Okay, well. Janice said 'Hi, do I look fat today?' And I, I looked at
her....
Ross  Whoa, whoa, whoa. You looked at her. You never look. You just answer, it's
just a reflex. Do I look fat? Nooo! Is she prettier than I am? Noo! Does size matter?
Rachel  Nooo!
Ross  And it works both ways.
Chandler  Okay, so you both just know this stuff?
Rachel  Well you know, after about thirty or forty fights, you kinda catch on.
Ross  Okay, for instance. Let's say, Janice is coming back from a trip and she
gives you two options. Option number 1 she'll take a cab home from the airport. Option 2
is you can meet her at baggage claim. Which do you do?
Chandler  That's easy, baggage claim.
Ross  (buzzes) Wrong! Now you're single. It's actually secret option number
three, you meet her at the gate. That way she knows you love her.
Chandler  Okay, this is good, this is good. All right listen, I have one. Janice
likes to cuddle, at night, which, you know I'm all for. But, uh, you know when you want to
go to sleep, you want some space. So, uh, how do I tell her that without, you know,
accidentally calling her fat or something.
Rachel  Oh honey, I'm sorry we can't help you there, 'cause we're cuddlily
sleepers. (Chandler makes an 'Ewww' face) Okay, I'm late for work.
Ross  Oh.
Rachel  All right are you guys gonna come down?
Ross  Uh, yeah, yeah I'll, I'm right behind you.
Rachel  Good luck Chandler.
Chandler  Thank you Rachel.
Ross  Bye sweetie.
Rachel  Bye hon.
Ross  (blows her a kiss) Okay the sleeping thing. Very tricky business, but
there is something you can do.
Chandler  Well, I thought you guys were cuddlily sleepers.
Ross  Noo! No, not cuddlily, not me, just her. I'm like you, I need the room.
Okay, come here. (they sit on the couch and Ross puts his hands on Chandler's shoulder and
thigh.) Okay, you're in bed...
Chandler  Yeah. (they both notice where his hands are)
Ross  I'm gonna use the cushion.
Chandler  Yeah.
Ross  Okay, you're in bed. She's over on your side, cuddling. Now you wait for
her to drift off, and then you hug her (demonstrates on the cushion) and roll her back
over to her side of the bed. And then you rollll a-way. Hug for her! Roll for you.
Chandler  Okay, the old hug and roll.
Ross  Yep.
Chandler  Okay, one question.
Ross  Shoot.
Chandler  You're pretending the pillow's a girl right?
[Scene  Central Perk, Joey is putting jam on his muffin, lots of jam]
Joey  Remember when you where a kid and your Mom would drop you off at the
movies with a jar of jam and a little spoon?
Rachel  (Looks at him) You're so pretty.
Phoebe  (entering) Hi!
All  Hey, Phoebe.
Phoebe  Hey, oh, you know that guy who's been following me? I talked to him
today.
Joey  (with food in his mouth) You talked to him. Are you crazy?
Phoebe  Okay, first I'm not crazy. And second, say it don't spray it. Anyway his
name is Malcom, and he wasn't following me, I mean he was, but 'cause he thought I was
Ursula, ick. And, that's why, that's why he couldn't just come up and talk to me. 'Cause
of the restraining order.
Chandler  Umm, not feeling better 'bout Malcom.
Phoebe  Ooh! No, no, no, no, he's not like a kook, no. He's just like this, this
very passionate, incredibly romantic guy, that got like a tinsy bit carried away, you
know. And we just get along really well, and he's so cute.
Ross  Oh my God, you've got a crush on your sister's stalker.
Phoebe  No, I'm just gonna help him, you know, get 'de-Ursula-ized', like you
know, like I did for Joey after he went out with her.
Joey  (with his mouthful) Hey, I didn't stalk her. I mean (he sprays Phoebe with
crumbs)
Phoebe  Okay, I asked for the news, not the weather.
Monica  (entering) Hey guys.
All  Hey Mon.
Monica  Joey, this is for you. (gives him a jar of jam) It's blackberry curin.
Joey  Aww. (tastes it) Ohh!
Chandler  Hey, Joe, I gotta ask. The girl from the Xerox place buck naked (holds
up one hand), or, or a big tub of jam. (holds up the other hand)
Joey  Put your hands together.
Monica  Joey, take your time with that. That's my last batch.
Joey  No more jam?!
Rachel  Well, what happened to your jam plan?
Monica  I figured out I need to charge seventeen bucks a jar just to break even.
So, I've got a new plan now. Babies.
Chandler  Well, your gonna need much bigger jars.
Ross  What are you talking about?
Monica  I'm talking about me having a baby.
Ross  What?
Rachel  Are you serious?
Monica  Yeah. The great thing about the jam plan was, I was taking control of my
life. So I asked myself, what is the most important thing to me in the world and that's
when I came up with the baby plan.
Ross  Well, aren't you forgetin' something? What, what, what is uh, what is that
guy's name? Dad!
Monica  It took me 28 years to find one man that I wanna spend my life with, if
I have to wait another 28 years then, I'll be 56 before I can have a baby, and that's just
stupid.
Chandler  That, that's what's stupid.
Monica  I don't need an actual man, just a couple of his best swimmers. And
there, there are places you can go to get that stuff.
Rachel  Down at the docks again?
[Scene  Chandler's bedroom, Janice and him are cuddling]
Janice  Night-night Bing-a-ling.
Chandler  Night-night.....Janice. (he starts thinking to him self) 'Look at
all that room on her side, you good fit a giant penguin over there. That would be weird
though. Okay, hug and roll time. I'm huggin', I'm huggin', your rollin', and....yes!
Freedom! (his one arm is still under her) Except for this arm! I'm stuck. Stuck arm! Okay,
time for the old table cloth trick, one fluid motion. Quick like a cat, quick like a cat!
And 1...2...3!' (Pulls his arm out from under her and she is spun off of the bed.)
[Scene  Central Perk, Malcom is giving Phoebe all of his spy stuff]
Malcom  Here's my binoculars.
Phoebe  Oh, great. Great. You're doing great, you know real strong. Going
strong. Keep going.
Malcom  These are my night vision goggles. This is the book I pretend to read
when I'm watching her in the park. And these are Mad Lips, they're just for fun.
Phoebe  Oh, yeah. What's this? (picks up a book)
Malcom  Oh, this is log I kept, recording her every movement. Do you wanna here
something from it?
Phoebe  Um, not even a little bit.
Malcom  It's about you.
Phoebe  Oh, okay then.
Malcom  (reading) I met Phoebe today. She was really nice to me eventhough I'm
such a loser. And, then when I was walking home I thought about her a lot, it was weird,
but kinda cool.
Phoebe  Good. So what were you thinking?
Malcom  I was thinking what it would be like to kiss you.
Phoebe  Really?
Malcom  No.
Phoebe  Oh.
Malcom  See that's just something I said now, so that maybe I could kiss you.
Phoebe  Oh, okay. (he kisses her)
[Scene  Monica and Rachel's, Joey is eating jam straight out of the jar, and Chandler
is staring at him in amazement. Joey offers him some.]
Chandler  No, that's all right. I just had a jar of mustard.
Monica  (entering from her bedroom) Okay, sperm donor number 03815, come on
down! Okay, he's 6'2", 170 pounds, and he describes himself as a male Geena Davis.
Chandler  You mean there's more than one of us.
Ross  Look, you can't do this Mon. All right, if you do this, I'm, I'm gonna,
I'm, I'm gonna.....
Monica  You're gonna what?
Ross  I'm gonna tell Mom.
Rachel  Honey, I'm sorry, but he's right. I love you, but you're crazy.
Ross  Crazy.
Monica  What?! Why? Why is this crazy? So this isn't the ideal way to
something....
Ross  (interrupting her) Oh, it's not the ideal way...
Monica  Lips moving, still talking. I mean it may not be ideal, but I'm so
ready. No, I-I-I see the way Ben looks at you. It makes me ache, you know?
Joey  Check it out!! Jam crackers!
Joey  Yeah, the Knicks rule!
Monica  Joey, this is you!
Joey  Let me see. (goes over and looks at the form) Oh, right.
Rachel  When did you go to a sperm bank?
Joey  Well, right after I did that sex study down at NYU. (to Chandler) Hey,
Remember that sweater I gave you for your birthday?
Chandler  And that's how you bought it?
Joey  Noooo, that's what I was wearing when I donated. I'm kinda surprised
there's any of my boys left.
Monica  Well, honey, it is pretty competitive. I mean I've got an actual rocket
scientist here.
Joey  Maybe, I should call this place and get them to put my 'Days of Our Lives'
on here. You know, juice this puppy up a little.
Phoebe  (entering) Hellooo!
All  Hey.
Ross  How's the maniac?
Phoebe  Oh, well he's yummy. We did a little kissin'.
Rachel  Phoebe, what are you doing?
Phoebe  Oh, no, no, no, no. You know what, he's not into that stuff anymore. He
quit for me.
Rachel  Pheebs, this guy has been obsessed with your sister, for God knows how
long, okay, you don't just give up something like that.
Phoebe  Look, he gave me his night vision goggles and everything.
Ross  You're taking the word of a guy who has night vision goggles?
Phoebe  What, he's not still following her. Do you think he is still following
her?
Chandler  Pheebs, wake up and smell the restraining order.
Phoebe  What are you saying I should do?
Monica  I think, that if you really like this guy, you should just trust him.
Phoebe  Thank you, Monica.
Joey  Orrr, you could follow him and see where he goes.
Monica  Oh, that's what I would do, forget mine.
[Scene  Central Perk]
Rachel  Oh my God, what happened? (points to the cast on Janice's wrist)
Janice  Oh. God, crazy Chandler. He spun me...off...the...bed!
Rachel  Wow! Spinning that sounds like fun.
Janice  Oh, (laughs) I wish. No, you know he was just trying Ross's Hug and Roll
thing.
Rachel  (turns around, not amused) Ross's what?
Janice  You know what, where he hugs you and kinda rolls you away and... Oh...
my....God.
[Scene  Subway station, Phoebe is following Malcom by finding behind the pillars until
she comes up to one with a wire mesh garbage can next to it. Malcom stops and starts
walking the other way and passes Phoebe, who quick tries to hide behind the garbage can.
But, Malcom sees her.]
Malcom  Phoebe?
Phoebe  Yes? Yes! Oh.
Malcom  What are you doing?
Phoebe  Oh, I was just here looking for, um, my um, my part of an old sandwich.
Oh, here it is! Oh. (picks one up out of the garbage can.)
Malcom  Were you following me?
Phoebe  Um, perhaps. Yes! Yes, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I was just afraid that you
were still hung up on my sister.
Malcom  So you spied on me. I can't believe you don't trust me. (Ursula walks
past, and Malcom finds behind the pillar)
Phoebe  Oh well, what do you know, there goes my identical twin sister. Just
walkin' along looking like me. What, is this just like a freakish coincidence, or did you
know she takes this train?
Malcom  I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I tried to stop, but I couldn't. I'm so pathetic.
Phoebe  No, no, it's not your fault. You know it's partly my fault, 'cause I
made you quit cold turkey. Sorry, no. Okay, well, I mean, I can't date you anymore, 'cause
your, you know (in a high pitched voice) Wow! But um, but I will definitely, definitely
help you get over my sister. Okay, stalk me for a while. Huh? Yeah, and, and, and, I'll be
like an Ursula patch.
Malcom  Uh-huh, I don't know.
Phoebe  Yeah, just, okay, look I'm going. Um, come on. Op, op, behind the
pillar, which way am I gonna go?
[Scene  Monica and Rachel's, Joey is entering]
Joey  Hey.
Monica  Hey.
Joey  Where you going?
Monica  To the bank.
Joey  Sperm or regular?
Monica  Sperm.
Joey  So you're really doing this, huh?
Monica  Oh yeah, picked a guy, 37135.
Joey  Sounds nice.
Monica  'Fraid so. Brown hair, green eyes...
Joey  No kiddin', hmm.
Monica  What?
Joey  No, I-I figured you would've picked a blond guy.
Monica  Really? Why?
Joey  I don't know, I just always pictured you ending up with one of those tall,
smart blond guys, name like.... Hoyt.
Monica  Hoyt?
Joey  It's a name, yeah. I saw you, you know, in this great house with a big
pool.
Monica  Really, is he a swimmer?
Joey  He's got the body for it.
Monica  I like that. (Joey starts laughing) What?
Monica  We do not have one of those signs.
Joey  Sure you do, it was a gift from me. Oh! And you have these three great
kids.
Monica  Two girls and a boy?
Joey  Yeah!
Monica  And, and, and they wear those little water wings, you know. And they're,
they're running around on the deck. Then Hoyt wraps this big towel around all three of
them.
Joey  Sure! (Monica gets very depressed) But hey, you know this way sounds good
too.
Monica  Yeah.
Joey  Oh Monica. (goes over and hugs her, then looks at the form and stops
hugging her.) Wow, this guy's an astronaut. That would've been cool, (sees Monica) for
like a day. (hugs her again).
[Scene  Monica and Rachel's, Joey is finishing off the last of the jam]
Joey  I called the sperm bank today, they haven't sold a single unit of
Tribianni. Nobody wants my product. I mean, I-I-I don't get it (tries to drink the rest of
the jam out of the jar and gets it all over his face, on his chin, nose, etc.) Maybe if
they met me in person.
Rachel  Honey, you got a little thing on your...(points to her whole face)
Joey  (wipes a little jam from the corner of his mouth) Did I get it?
Rachel  Yeah.
Ross  (entering) Hello.
Rachel  Hello.
Ross  (sees Joey) Hey. (walks into the living room) Uh, Chan, can I uh, can I
talk to you for a second?
Chandler  Sure. What's up?
Ross  Just one uh, one additional relationship thought. Probably something your
already familiar with, uh, women talk! (smacks Chandler over the head with a magazine)
Host  Welcome everybody, welcome to Amazing Discoveries!
Joey  You guys, can we please not watch this all right.
All  Shhhh!
Host  Folks, has this ever happened to you. You go to the refrigerator to get
a nice glass of milk, (Joey is in the background struggling to open a cartoon of milk) and
these darn cartons are so flingin'-flangin' hard to open.
Joey  (on tv) Oh, you said it Mike. (rips open the carton and spills milk on the
counter) Aw! There's got to be a better way!
Mike  And there is Kevin.
Rachel  Noo way, Kevin.
Mike  There is a revolutionary new product that guarantees that you'll never
have to open up milk cartons again. Meet the Milk Master 2000.
Chandler  You're flingin'-flangin' right I am!
Mike  Keep in mind, he's never used this product before, you're gonna see how
easy this is to do. (to Kevin) Go ahead. ('Kevin' starts using the product, it is a spout
that you jab into a paper milk carton so that you don't have to rip it open.) This works
with any milk carton.
Joey  (on TV, finishing installing the Milk Master 2000) Wow, it is easy.
(starts to poor the milk) Now, I can have milk everyday.
[Scene  Central Perk, Chandler, Monica, Janice are sitting on the couch, and Phoebe is
sitting next to them in the chair.]
Chandler  Well, it's official there are no good movies.
Janice  Well, let's go to a bad one and make out. (they start to kiss and lean
back into Monica.)
Monica  Perhaps, you would like me to turn like this, (turns sideways on the
couch) so that you can bunny bump against my back.
Joey  (entering) Hey!
Phoebe  Hey.
Chandler  Hey, man. What's up?
Joey  Maybe you can tell me. My agent would like to know why I didn't show up at
the audition I didn't know I had today. The first good thing she gets me in weeks. How
could you not give me the message?!
Chandler  Well, I'll tell ya I do enjoy guilt, but, ah, it wasn't me.
Phoebe  Yes, it was! It was him! Uh huh! (they all stare at her) Okay, it was
me!
Joey  How is it you?
Phoebe  Well, it was just, it was all so crazy, you know. I mean, Chandler was
in the closet, counting to 10, and he was up to 7 and I hadn't found a place to hide yet.
I-I-I meant to tell you, and I wrote it all down on my hand. See, all of it. (shows him
her hand)
Joey  Yep, that's my audition.
Monica  See, now this is why I keep notepads everywhere.
Phoebe  Yep, and that's why we don't invite you to play.
Janice  What is the great tragedy here? You go get yourself another appointment.
Joey  Well, Estelle tried, you know. The casting director told her that I missed
my chance.
Phoebe  That is unfair. I'll call her and tell her it was totally my fault.
Joey  Pheebs, you can't do that. The casting director doesn't talk to friends,
she only talks to agents.
Phoebe  What a sad little life she must lead. Okay, ooh (starts dialing).
Joey  What, what are you doing? What are you doing?
Phoebe  No, no, no, I know, I know, ooh. (on the phone in a different voice)
'Hi, this is Katelynn, from Phoebe Buffay's office. Um, is um, Ann there for Phoebe,
she'll know what it's about.'
Joey  Hang up, hang up. (reaches with his good arm, but Phoebe grabs it and he
tries to reach the phone with his other arm but can't because of the sling.)
Phoebe  (on phone) 'Annie! Hi. Listen we got a problem with Joey Tribbiani,
apparently he missed his audition. Who did you speak to in my office? Estelle, no, I don't
know what I'm going to do with her. No. All right, so your husband leaves and burns down
the apartment, the world does not stop.'
Chandler  Is anybody else scared?
Phoebe  (on phone) 'Right, well look, um, if Joey loses this audition, that is
it for Estelle. I don't care! Annie you are a doll, what time can you see him?' (to
Monica) I need a pen. (Chandler hands her one, but she needs something to right on, so she
tilts Chandler's head over and writes on the back of his neck)
Chandler  Get the woman a pad! Get the woman a pad! A pad! A pad!
Monica  Oh, now you want a pad.
[Scene  Monica and Rachel's, Carol and Susan are dropping off Ben]
Carol and Susan  (entering) Hey!!
Ross  There's my boy! Here's my boy! And here's his Barbi (Ben is holding a
Barbi doll) What's ah, what's my boy doing with a Barbi?
Carol  He picked it out of the toy store himself, he loves it.
Susan  He carries it everywhere, it's like a security blanket, but with ski
boots and a kicky beret.
Ross  Yeah, it's, it's, it's cute. Why, why, why does he have it, again?
Susan  So he's got a doll? So what? Unless you're afraid he's gonna grow up and
be in show business.
Carol  This doesn't have anything to do with the fact that he is being raised by
two women, does it?
Ross  You know what it's fine. If you're okay with the Barbi thing, so
am I.
Ross  Give daddy the Barbi! Ben, give, give me the Barbi.
Okay, how 'bout, don't you want to play with the monster truck? (makes a monster truck
sound) No. Okay, oh, oh, how about a Dino-soilder? (squawks like a dinosaur)
Rachel  Ross, you are so pathetic. Why can't your son just play with his doll?
(uses the Milk Master 2000 to pour milk into her cereal)
Monica  (entering from her bedroom) I gotta go to work. Has anybody seen my left
boob?
Joey  I love that movie. (Joey is using it as a pillow)
Monica  There it is. Joey, what are you doing?
Joey  I'm sorry, it just felt nice.
Chandler  (entering with his ringing phone) Joe. Joe! Answer the phone.
Joey  Hey, I only got one good arm, you know. You should be doing stuff for me.
Go get me a sweater.
Chandler  Just do it! Okay, it's Janice and if I get it I'm going to have to see
her tonight. (phone stops ringing) Oh, that's great I'm gonna have to see her tonight.
Rachel  What's the big deal? Why don't you wanna see Janice?
Chandler  Okay, last night at dinner, when the meals came, she put half her
chicken piccata on my plate and took my tomatoes.
Ross  And that's bad because..., you hate chicken piccata?
Chandler  Noo.
Ross  You didn't want to share your tomatoes, tomatoes are very important to
you.
Rachel  Men are unbelievable.
Monica  What is it with you people! I mean, the minute you start to feel
something, you have to run away?
Chandler  I know, that, (looks at her fake chest, and loses his train of
thought, temporarily) that's why I don't want to go tonight, I'm afraid I'm going to say
something stupid.
Monica  Oh, you mean like that guy thing where you act mean and distant until
you get us to break up with you.
Joey  Hey, you know about that?!
Chandler  Look what do I do? I wanna get past this, I don't wanna be afraid of
the commitment thing. I wanna go through the tunnel, to the other side!
Ross  (to Joey) Where there is no fear of commitment.
Chandler  Do we have any...(turns around and bumps Monica's fake chest) Do we
have any thoughts here?
Joey  Well, I've never been through the tunnel myself, 'cause as I understand
it, you're not allowed to go through with more than one girl in the car, right. But, it
seems to me it's pretty much like anything else, you know, face your fear. It have a fear
of heights, you go to the top of the building! If you're afraid of bugs.....get a bug.
Right. In this case, you have a fear of commitment, so I say you go in there and be the
most committed guy there ever was.
Rachel  Amazingly, that makes sense.
Chandler  You think?
Joey  Oh, yeah. Go for it man, jump off the high dive, stare down the barrel of
the gun, pee into the wind!
Chandler  Yeah, Joe, I assure you if I'm staring down the barrel of a gun, I'm
pretty much peeing every which way.
[Scene  Central Perk, Phoebe's beeper is going off]
Phoebe  Oh, it's your audition from this morning. Can I use the phone again?
Rachel  Sure Pheebs, you know, that's what it's there for, emergencies and
pretend agents.
Joey  Come on baby, come on!
Phoebe  (on phone, in 'Katelynn's' voice) 'Hi, I have Phoebe Buffay returning a
page. Okay, well, um, she's in her car I'll have to patch you through.'
Rachel  Very nice touch.
Phoebe  (in voice, on phone) 'Okay, go ahead.' (in normal voice on phone) Um, hi
Annie. (listens) Fantastic! (to Joey) You got it. (on phone) Oh, okay, um, 'Will he work
for scale?' you ask me. Well, I don't know about that, (Joey clears his throat to signify
yes) except that I do and he will. Great, oh you are such a sweetheart. I would love to
have lunch with you, how about we have lunch next....(hangs up phone) Op, went through a
tunnel.
Rachel  Unbelievable.
Joey  Thank you so much.
Phoebe  It was really fun, I mean I've never talked on a car phone before.
Joey  You were amazing, could you just do me this huge favor, you see there's
this one other audition that I really, really want, and Estelle couldn't get me in.
Phoebe  Oh, I don't know. I mean it was fun one time.
Joey  Come on, please, it'll be just this one more, well actually it's two.
Phoebe  Two?
Joey  Yeah! Well, well really it's three. Please. You're so good at it. I love
you.
Phoebe  Okay, I'll do it, but just these three, right
Joey  Nooo, four.
[Scene  Chandler and Joey's, Chandler and Janice are having dinner]
Janice  So, how come you wanted to eat in tonight?
Chandler  'Cause, I wanted to uh, give you this. (hands her a present)
Janice  Ohhh, are you a puppy! (opens it) Contact paper! I never really know
what to say when someone you're sleeping with gives you contact paper.
Chandler  Well, wait there's, there's more. See the contact paper is to go into
your brand new drawer. (gives her a drawer) See, the drawer actually goes in my dresser.
Janice  Oh, you didn't have to do this.
Chandler  Yes, I did. Yes, I did. Because, you're my girlfriend, and that's what
girlfriends should, should get.
Janice  Well, I gotta buy a vowel. Because, oh my Gawd! Who, would've thought
that someday, Chandler Bing would buy me a drawer.
Chandler  Well, not me. But that's what's happened, and, ah, and, and there's
more. We should take a trip.
Janice  We should?
Chandler  Yep, we're a couple and that's what couples do. And, I wanna meet your
parents. We should take a trip with your parents!
Janice  (laughs) I don't think we need to, because you're tripping me out right
now! Are you okay?
Chandler  I am, I actually am. I mean this is amazing. My entire life I have
feared this place, and now that I'm here it's like what was the big deal. I could probably
say 'Let's move in together.' and I'd be okay.
Janice  You probably want us to move in together?
Chandler  It doesn't scare me!
Janice  Yeah, well, it scares me! I mean I not even divorced yet, Chandler. You
know, you just invited me over here for pasta, and all of the sudden you're talking about
moving in together. And, and I wasn't even that hungry. You know what, it's getting a
little late, and I-I should just, um...(starts to leave)
Chandler  Oh, no, no, no, don't go! I've scared ya'! I've said too much! I'm
hopeless, and awkward, and desperate for love!! (Janice leaves, Chandler then calls Janice
to leave a message on her machine) Hey, Janice! It's me. Um, yeah, I-I-I just wanna
apologize in advance for having chased you down the street. (runs out the door)
[Scene  Monica and Rachel's, Monica and Rachel are comforting Chandler]
Rachel  Honey, this will help. (hands him a tub of ice cream)
Chandler  So, I finally catch up to her and she says this relationship is going
to fast and we have to slow down.
Rachel and Monica  Uff.
Monica  That is never good.
Chandler  Then I got all needy and clingy.
Rachel  Okay, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute. Maybe it's not so
bad. How did you leave it?
Chandler  She said she'd call me.
Rachel and Monica  Ohh! (both grab there stomachs in pain)
Chandler  Oh God.
Monica  Welcome to our side of the tunnel.
Chandler  This ice cream tastes like crap by the way.
Rachel  Yeah, well that's that lo-cal, non dairy, soy milk junk. We sort of, we
save the real stuff for those really terminal cases.
Monica  You know, when you start get screwed over all the time, you gotta switch
to low-fat.
Rachel  Yeah, you do.
Chandler  So, you don't think I'm terminal?
Monica  Well, no, not at all, you're not terminal, you just, you just need some
damage control.
Chandler  Okay, okay. So, should I call her?
Rachel and Monica  Nooo!
Rachel  This is a very critical time right now. If you feel yourself reaching
for that phone, then you go shoe shopping, you get your butt in a bubble bath. You want
her back you have to start acting aloof.
Monica  She has to know that your not ready.
Rachel  Right. So, what you have to do is, you have to accidentally run into her
on purpose. And then act aloof.
Chandler  So I'm not, not gonna lose her?
Rachel  Oooh, honey, you're not a total loser.
Chandler  I said, 'So I'm not gonna lose her?'
Rachel  Oh.
[Scene  Monica and Rachel's, Ross is still trying to get Ben to play with something
other than the Barbi doll.]
Ross  Guess who's here. It's the toughest guy in toy land, Ben. (singing) 'A
real American hero. I'm G.I. Joe!' Drop the Barbi, drop the Barbi.
Rachel  G.I. Joe? Do you really think he's gonna fall for that?
Joey  (entering) G. I. Joe! Cool! Can I play?
Ross  Look Ben, it's a toy that protects U.S. oil interests overseas!
Joey and Ross  Go Joe!!!
Phoebe  (entering) Helloo! Oh! (sees Joey and starts to leave)
Joey  Pheebs! There you are!
Phoebe  No it's not, sorry.
Joey  But Phoebe, wait! Wait! Phoebe. Phoebe! (catches her in the hallway)
Phoebe  Oh, Joey! Oh, okay, see I didn't recognize you wearing, in
those....pants.
Joey  Look listen, that TV movie I went in for? Did you hear anything? I think I
got a shot at it.
Phoebe  Yes! They called and you didn't get it! Okay, I mean you didn't get it,
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
Joey  It's okay, these things happen.
Phoebe  But they shouldn't happen, you know what, you're, you're in a terrible,
terrible business. Oh God, I don't wanna be the person who makes your face look like that.
Joey  I'm, I'm okay. See. (tries to smile, but fails horribly)
Phoebe  Oh, now you're sad and creepy, oh. You know what, I, I'm sorry I quit,
okay, I just quit.
Joey  No! No, no you can't quit! You're the best agent I ever had! Look Pheebs,
rejection is part being an actor, you can't take it personally.
Phoebe  Not personal, really, well they said that they never met an Italian
actor with a worse Italian accent.
Joey  They actually said that?
Phoebe  Yeah. Ooh God, there's that face again! See I can't do this job! I...
Joey  No, no, no, see that's why you have to do this job, agents always lie. You
know, Estelle just says stuff like 'They went another way', but this, I can use this. (in
a very bad Italian accent) I canna work on a new accent.
Phoebe  Yeah okay, no if it helps you okay. Yeah.
Ross  (running into the hall, in slow motion) You'll never get me, Joe!!! (he
then pretends that he gets shot repeatedly and falls back against Joey and Chandler's
door, dead.)
[Scene  A grocery store that Janice shops in. Chandler is on purpose, accidentally
bumping into her.]
Janice  (to butcher) No, thank you. (Chandler makes a sound and she notices him)
Chandler!
Chandler  (in a British accent) Hello, Janice.
Janice  What are you doing here?
Chandler  (in accent) Oh, just a bit of shopping. How've you been?
Janice  Are you being British?!
Chandler  (normal voice) No. Not anymore.
Janice  Why are you shopping here? You don't live in this neighborhood. Were you
here waiting for me?
Chandler  Yeah, huh. I'm just uh, you know I'm just picking up some things for a
party. (grabs a bag off of the shelf)
Janice  Barley? What kind of party serves barley?
Chandler  Well, I'm sorry if my friends aren't as sophisticated as yours.
Janice  Where is this party?
Chandler  Here in Chelsea.
Janice  Who's party is it?
Chandler  A woman's
Janice  What woman?!
Chandler  (shyly) Chelsea.
Janice  Okay, you know, one of two things is happening here. Either you're
seeing somebody behind my back, which would make you the biggest jerk on the planet. Or,
else you're pretending that you're seeing somebody, which just makes you so pathetic that
I could start crying right here in the cereal aisle. So like which of these two guys do
you want to be? (another guy walks by)
Chandler  Can I be that guy?
[Scene  Central Perk, Joey and Phoebe are there]
Phoebe  Okay, so we got some more good rejections, lots of stuff to work on.
Joey  Okay, shoot.
Phoebe  Okay, um, oh, the zoo commercial.
Joey  I didn't get it?
Phoebe  No. They said you 'Weren't believable as a human being.' So, you can
work on that.
Joey  Okay, what else?
Phoebe  Um, the off-Broadway play people said 'You were pretty but dumb.'
Joey  Oh.
Phoebe  Oh no wait, I'm sorry, that's 'pretty dumb.'
Joey  Look, it's okay, no, no, no, really, look um, I really appreciate this
Pheebs, but I think I'm gonna have to go back to Estelle.
Phoebe  Oh.
Joey  Yeah, well don't get me wrong, you're a better agent than she is, but at
least with her I don't want to blow my pretty dumb brains out.
Phoebe  Yeah, no, I understand.
Joey  You do, thanks.
Phoebe  Yeah. Sorry. (she starts to leave)
Joey  Wait a minute.
Phoebe  What?
Joey  Wait a minute, did you just make up all that stuff just to get out of
being my agent.
Phoebe  (in a coy tone) Oh, you caught me. I am so busted.
Joey  (in a really, really bad Italian accent) That's-ah what I suspected-ah.
[Scene  Chandler and Joey's, Chandler is laying on the counter and Rachel and Monica
are comforting him again.]
Chandler  ....And then I just, you know, threw the bag of barley at her, and ran
out of the store.
Monica  My God! Chandler, we said be 'aloof' not 'a doof'.
Chandler  I've actually ruined this haven't I? It's time for the good ice cream
now, right?
Rachel  Yeah, it is.
Monica  You know what, everything's gonna be okay.
Chandler  (answering phone) Hello. Hi, Janice! Can you hold on for a second?
Okay. (to Monica and Rachel) Okay, what do I do?
Rachel  Shhh...I don't know what to do, this is totally unprecedented.
Monica  If-if-if we ever did what you did a man would never call.
Rachel  Yeah.
Chandler  Hello!
Monica  Oh wait, you know what, I got it, I got it, pretend like you just woke
up, okay, that will throw her off. Be sleepy.
Rachel  Yes, and grumpy.
Chandler  What are you, stop naming dwarves! (on phone) Hello, Janice. Hi, I'm
so glad that you called, I know I've been acting a really weird lately. And, it's just
because I'm crazy about you, and I just got...stupid, and, and scared, and....stupid a
couple of more times. I'm sorry. (listens) Really?! (listens) Really?!
Rachel  He's soo lucky, if Janice were a guy, she'd be sleeping with somebody
else by now.
Chandler  (on phone) I love you too.
Monica  Aw, it's soo unfair. (they both start digging into the 'good' ice cream)
[Scene  Monica and Rachel's, Carol and Susan are picking up Ben, while Monica is
pouring chocolate syrup, lots of it, into her ice cream.]
Carol  G. I. Joe. G. I. Joe?!
Ross  Hey, I don't know what to tell you guys that's the doll he chose.
Susan  What'd you do, dip it in sugar?
Ross  Look, G. I. Joe's in, Barbi's out. And if you guys can't
deal with it, that's your 'too bad.'
Monica  What are you being such a weenie for? So he has a Barbi, big deal. You
used to dress up like a woman.
Ross  What?
Monica  Well, you used to dress up in Mom's clothes all the time.
Ross  What are you talking about?
Monica  The big hat, the pearls, the little pick handbag.
Ross  Okay, you are totally making this up.
Monica  How can you not remember? You made us call you...Bea.
Ross  (remembering) Oh God.
Susan  I've literally never been this happy.
Monica  Wasn't there a little song?
Carol  Oh please God, let there be a song.
Ross  There was no song. (to Monica) There was no song!
Monica  (singing) 'I am Bea.'
Ross  Okay.
Monica  'I drink tea.'
Ross  Okay, that's, that's enough. (retreats to the bathroom)
Monica  '....Won't you, won't you, won't you.... '
Ross  (coming out of the bathroom) Won't you dance around with me.
Monica  A-ha!!! (they all start laughing, as Ross hides in the bathroom)
[Scene  It's an old home movie of the Geller's backyard, young Ross is dressed up as
Bea, and pouring himself/herself some tea.]
Young Ross  (singing) 'I am Bea. I drink tea. Won't you dance
around with....' (spills some tea and it drips onto his/her dress) Ohhh! (runs away
crying)
Young Monica  (entering the shot) Ross!!! (starts to wipe up
the spill)
[Scene  Chandler and Joeys, there is lumber all over the apartment]
Chandler  (entering) Hey!
Joey  Hey!
Chandler  Hey-hey-hey. So what happened? A forest tick you off?
Joey  No. Y'know how were always saying we need a place for the mail.
Chandler  Yeah!
Joey  Well, I started building one. But then I decided to take it to the next
step.
Chandler  Youre building a post office?
Joey  No, an entertainment unit, with a mail cubby built right in. Its a
one day job, max.
Chandler  Okay. (notices that Joey is wearing some really tight jeans) My word!
Those are snug.
Joey  Oh yeah. These are my old work pants, Sergio Valentes.
Joey  Power saw kinda got away from me there.
[Scene  Outside Central Perk, Phoebe is pacing back and forth waiting for someone.]
Rachel  (joining Phoebe outside) Hey Pheebs.
Phoebe  Hey!
Rachel  Any sign of your brother?
Phoebe  No, but hes always late.
Rachel  I thought you only met him once?
Phoebe  Yeah, I did. I think it sounds y'know big sistery, y'know,
Franks always late.
Rachel  Well relax, hell be here.
Phoebe  No, I know, Im just nervous. Y'know its just y'know
Moms dead, dont talk to my sister, Grandmas been sleeping a lot lately.
Its like the last desperate chance to have a family, y'know, kinda thing.
Youre so sweet to wait with me.
Rachel  Well, actually Gunther sent me. Youre not allowed to have cups out
here, its a thing. (takes her cup and goes back inside)
[Scene  inside Central Perk]
Chandler  Does anyone else think David Copperfield is cute?
Monica  No, but he told me, he thinks your a fox.
Chandler  All right, Janice, likes him. In fact she likes him so much she put
him on her freebie list.
Joey  Her what?
Chandler  Well, we have a deal, where we each get to pick five celebrities that
we can sleep with, and the other one cant get mad.
Ross  Ah, the heart of every healthy relationship. Honesty, respect, and sex
with celebrities.
Monica  So, Chandler, whos on your list?
Chandler  Ah, Kim Basinger, Cindy Crawford, Halle Berry, Yasmine Bleeth, and ah,
Jessica Rabbit.
Rachel  Now, you do realize that shes a cartoon, and way out of your
league?
Chandler  I know, I know, I just always wondered if I could get her eyes to pop
out of her head.
Joey  Hey, Monica, who would yours be?
Monica  First, I need a boyfriend, then I can have a list.
Joey  Its just a game Mon. (makes a Can-you-believe-her face
to the rest of the gang.) Rach, how about you?
Rachel  Oh, I dont know, I guess, Chris ODonnel, John F. Kennedy,
Jr., Daniel Day Lewis, Sting, and Parker Stevenson.
Ross  Spiderman?
Rachel  Hardy Boy.
Chandler  Peter Parker.
Ross  Thank you.
Rachel  What about you honey, who would be on your list?
Ross  Well I-I-I, that kind of thing requires some serious thought. First,
Ill divide my perspective canidates into catergories....
Chandler  (coughing) What a geek!
Phoebe  (entering) Everbody this is Frank! This is my half-brother Frank.
All  Oh, hi.
Phoebe  This is everybody. This is Ross.
Frank  How are you?
Ross  Hey.
Phoebe  Chandler.
Chandler  Hi.
Frank  Hi.
Phoebe  Joey.
Joey  Hey-hey!
Frank  Hey.
Phoebe  This is Monica.
Frank  Whoa!
Phoebe  And this is Rachel.
Rachel  Hi!
Frank  Whoa!!
Phoebe  Im gonna get coffee.
Frank  Hey, how do you guys get anything done?
Chandler  We dont, really.
Rachel  Well, so, now, do you guys have a lot of big plans?
Phoebe  Oh yeah! Yeah, no, were gonna connect, y'know bond, and
everything.
Frank  Yeah, I was thinking that maybe we could go down to Time Square and pick
up some ninja stars. And, oh, um, my friend Larry, he wants me to take a picture of a
hooker.
Chandler  You know, we dont really take advantage of living in the city.
Joey  I know.
[Scene  Chandler and Joeys, Joey is drilling a hole in the wall and the drill
comes out the other side really close to Chandlers head. Chandler then rushes out to
talk to Joey.]
Joey  Oh, Im sorry. Did I get ya?
Chandler  No, you didnt get me!! Its an electric drill, you get
me, you kill me!!
Joey  Calm down, do you want this unit or not?
Chandler  I do NOT want this unit!!
Joey  Well, you shouldve told me that before, Im not a mind reader.
Hey, were out of beer. Im going to Monicas.
Chandler  Fine! (goes into his room and slams the door, then he slams the bottom
half of the door.)
[Scene  Monica and Rachels, Joey is entering]
Monica  Hey! Where ya headin in those pants? 1982?
Joey  Oh Monica, listen, I ah, I saw down at the hardware store, they got those
designer tiles on sale. If you ever want to redo the bathroom floor.
Monica  Why, whats wrong with my bathroom floor?
Joey  Nothing. Its just old and dingy, thats all.
Monica  I highly doubt that. (they both go to the bathroom)
Joey  Oh yeah. If you ah, move your hamper, you see what color the tile used to
be. (Monica gasps) Yeah.
Monica  I cant live like this! What are we gonna do? What are we gonna do?
Joey  Relax. Here hold this (hands her his beer). This old stuff just comes
right off. (he bends down to try and lift some tile right in the middle of the floor, in
his tight pants.)
Monica  Thats a little more than I wanted to see.
Joey  (manages to pry off only a small piece) Aw! Look at that, every inch of
this stuff is glued down. Itd take forever to pry this up. You should ah, you should
just leave it. (starts to walk away, but Monica grabs him)
Monica  I cant leave it! You gouged a hole in my dingy floor.
Joey  Eh! There you go.
Monica  You know thats nice, y'know we could put it back there after the
surgeons remove it from your colon!
[Scene  Phoebes, Frank and her, are sitting on the counh, watching TV]
Phoebe  (sits up) Oh, ew!
Frank  What?
Phoebe  Yeah I know what I wanted to ask you. Um, can you roll your tongue?
Because I can, and my Mom couldnt, and I thought y'know, I figured that was
something I got from our Dad.
Frank  What, wait, you mean like this? (does it)
Phoebe  Yeah, yeah. You can do it to. (tries to do it, but cant)
Frank  Your not doing it.
Phoebe  Oh right, yeah okay, my Mom could, and I cant. We dont have
that....
Frank  Whens your birthday?
Phoebe  Feburary 16th.
Frank  I know a guy whos the 18th.
Phoebe  Wow, thats close. Whens yours?
Frank  October 25th.
Phoebe  Thats the same month as Halloween. So, um, what kinda
things do you like to do at home?
Frank  Melt stuff.
[Scene  Central Perk, Ross is working on his list]
Ross  Okay, Ive got three of my five.
Rachel  Three of your five, what?
Ross  Celebrities Im allowed to sleep with.
Rachel  Oh my God! You are giving this a lot of thought.
Ross  Yeah, its hard okay, I only have two spots left.
Chandler  All right, so who do you got it narrowed down to?
Ross  Okay, Elizabeth Hurely....
Chandler  Oooh-hoo, very attractive, forgiving.
Ross  Susan Sarandon.
Chandler  Eh, y'know what, shes to political, she probably wouldnt
let you do it, unless you donated four cans of food first.
Ross  And!! Isabella Rosselini.
Chandler  Ooh-hoo. Very hot, very sexy. But ah, y'know shes too
international, y'know shes never gonna be around.
Rachel  So?
Chandler  So, you gotta play the odds, pick somebody whos gonna be in the
country like all the time.
Rachel  Yeah, cause thats why you wont get Isabella Rosselini,
geography.
[Scene  Phoebes, Frank is melting a plastic spoon.]
Phoebe  Okay so, by melting, you meant melting.
Frank  Yeah.
Phoebe  So is it like art?
Frank  Yeah, you can melt art. Hey, can I use your phone?
Phoebe  Um, yeah sure. Why you wanna call your Mom?
Frank  No, I wanna melt it.
Phoebe  Oh, well um, not right now. Y'know Im just gonna go to bed, I
think the fumes are giving me a headache.
Frank  (starts laughing) Yeah!
Phoebe  Gnight, bro.
Frank  Gnight.
Phoebe  Here. (gives him a fire extinguisher) Y'know, just in case.
Frank  Oh, excellent. (starts to melt the fire extinguishers hose.)
[Scene  Monica and Rachels, Phoebe is eating breakfast with Monica while Frank is
playing with num-chucks on the balcony]
Monica  What kind of karate is that?
Phoebe  No kind. He just makes it up.
Monica  So hows it going with you guys?
Phoebe  So far, it kinda blows. I dont know, I just thought y'know that
hed feel more like a brother y'know, like you and Ross, just like close and
connected and....
Monica  Oh honey, were close now but you-you wouldnt believe the
years of-of nugies, and wedgies, and flying wedgies, and atomic wedgies, and....(Phoebe
shakes her head like she doesnt understand) Thats where the waistband actually
goes over your head.
Phoebe  Ah!!
Monica  Oh, we used to drive each other crazy playing the shadow game.
Phoebe  Oh, how do you play the shadow game?
Monica  Oh, how do you play the shadow game?
Phoebe  I just asked you.
Monica  I just asked you.
Phoebe  I dont have time for this.
Monica  No, that is what the game is.
Phoebe  Which you just gave up really quickly.
Chandler  (entering) Have you seen Joey?
Monica  Whats the matter?
Chandler  Oh, just this! (turns around and has a paint lid stuck to the back of
his pants.) Yknow what its my fault really, because the couch is usually where
we keep the varnish.
Joey  (yelling from bathroom) Hey, does somebody wanna hand me one of those
tiles.
Chandler  Whats going on?
Monica  Hes retiling my floor. (they both run to the bathroom)
Chandler  Yo!! Spackel boy! Get up!
Monica  Ah-ah-ah, now you started this, you will finish it.
Chandler  He started mine first!
Phoebe  Build the unit Cinderelly, lay the tile Cinderelly.
[Scene  Phoebes, Phoebe and Frank are watching TV.]
Frank  Whoa! Big octopus.
Phoebe  Yeah. (phone rings and Phoebe answers it) Hello. (listens) Oh my
God, I totally forgot! (listens) Well cant someone else do it. (listens) But, I have
company. (listens) Yeah, no look, thats all right Ill come in. (hangs up
phone) Um, Frank, Im really sorry but I have to go to work. Its-its one
of my regulars and hes insisting that I do um.
Frank  Hey, what kind of work do you do?
Phoebe  Oh! Im a masseuse. I give people massages and stuff.
Frank  You-you work at one of those massage parlors?
Phoebe  Well, y'know we dont call it that, but yeah!
Frank  (starts laughing) Wow! Thats wild! No, I had no idea.
Phoebe  All righty. Ill be back in-in a little bit. Unless you wanna come
with me?
Frank  You mean like watch?
Phoebe  No, no, you can get one yourself. Itll be on the house! Y'know
what are big sisters for?
Frank  Well, I dont think this, y'know.
Phoebe  No, no, no, I wouldnt do you myself, I mean that would be weird.
Yeah, no, Ill get one of the other girls to do it. Oh, this will be so much fun!
Hey! Are you excited?
Frank  Yeah! Hey, do Monica and Rachel work there?
[Scene  Monica and Rachels bathroom, Joey and Monica are admiring the new floor.]
Monica  Its beautiful! Its like the first bathroom floor there ever
was. (Chandler tries to go to the bathroom) Whoa! Are you going in there for?
Chandler  What, like a number?
Ross  (entering) Hey!
Chandler  Hi! Bye! (runs to the bathroom)
Ross  Okay, Im done with my choices, these are final. (holds up a little
card)
Rachel  Well, its about time.
Joey  Ooh, very official.
Ross  Oh, yeah, well y'know Chandler printed it up on his computer.
Monica  And who laminated it?
Ross  That would be me.
Rachel  All right let me see. (grabs the card) Uma Thurman, Winona Ryder,
Elizabeth Hurely, Michelle Pfieffer, and Dorothy Hammel?
Ross  Hey, its my list.
Rachel  Okay honey, you do realize she only spins like that on ice.
[Scene  Healing Hands Inc. (Phoebes work), Frank is being ushered in, by the arm,
to the room Phoebe is in by another girl.]
Frank  Ow!-Ow!-Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Y'know, ow!
Phoebe  Hey!-Hey! Whats going on?
Frank  She broke my arm.
Girl  He touched my fanny.
Frank  No, she touched mine first!
Girl  Thats my job!
Frank  So wait, whats the deal here, I can have sex with you, but I
cant touch you?
Phoebe and Girl  Ewww!!!
Phoebe  You cant have sex with her!
Girl  Whatd you think I was, a hooker?
Frank  No, your a masseuse, its cool, Im not a cop.
Phoebe  Okay, Jasmine, can you, can you ask Mr. Whiffler if he can wait for like
five minutes.
Jasmine  Fine. (starts to leave, and points at Frank) I dont like you!!
(leaves)
Phoebe  (turns around and hits Frank) So thats what you thought I did!!
God! Thats not what I do!
Frank  Wait thats-thats, what thats not what you do?
Phoebe  Nooo! Why would you think that?
Frank  I dont know, I mean, y'know, this is the city y'know, I just, I
mean, I dont know.
Phoebe  Whatever, its the perfect end to the perfect weekend anyways.
Frank  Oh, wait, no your right, no it was perfect and I cant believe that
I screwed it up so bad.
Phoebe  You really thought it was perfect?
Frank  Well, no, maybe-maybe it wasnt perfect, but y'know it was pretty
cool, y'know, cause we had all those great talks y'know.
Phoebe  Yeah, um, which ones in particular were great for you?
Frank  Well y'know about the tongue thing, y'know, and how I told you about my
likes and my dislikes...
Phoebe  I dont....
Frank  How-how I like to melt stuff, and how I dislike stuff that doesnt
melt.
Phoebe  Right, okay, um-mm.
Frank  Yeah, y'know I feel like I can really talk to you cause y'know
youre my sister, y'know.
Phoebe  Yeah, I guess I do, yeah.
Frank  Then I go feel your friend up and make you mad at me.
Phoebe  Well, I-I wasnt hopping mad, y'know.
Frank  You hopped a little bit. Yeah, I really sorry.
Phoebe  Okay. All right, this is my favourite part of the weekend, right now,
this.
Frank  This?
Phoebe  Uh-huh.
Frank  Oh come on we went, we went to Time Square, we found ninja stars, I
almost got arm broken by a hooker...
Phoebe  She wasnt a hooker.
Frank  Well, when I tell my friends about her she will be.
[Scene  Chandler and Joeys, everyone is there, helping to lift the entertainment
center into place]
Chandler  Okay, on three. One....Two....
Joey  Why dont we just go on two.
Chandler  Why two?
Joey  Because its faster.
Chandler  Yeah, I coulda counted to three like four times without all this
two talk.
Rachel  Oh!
Joey  All right, but in the future...
Ross  Okay!! Okay!!
Rachel  Come on!
Ross  Heavy thing, not getting lighter!
Chandler  Okay, one...two...
Joey  So we are going on two?
All  All right!! (they lift it into place, however there is one small problem,
the unit is so long that it blocks some of both of their bedroom doors.)
Chandler  Oh, good job Joe.
Joey  Wow, its big!
Chandler  Yeah-yeah, so big that it actually makes our doors look smaller!
Joey  Maybe, my rulers wrong.
Phoebe  Maybe all the rulers are wrong.
Joey  Look its not that bad. So what, it blocks a little of your door, a
little of my door.
Chandler  Yeah, y'know what I got a better idea. How-how bout it blocks
none of mine door and a lot of yours? (throws his shoulder into the center to try and move
it, but it doesnt move.)
Joey  Yeah, listen, before I forget that side is still wet.
[Scene  Central Perk, Rachel is serving some guy coffee.]
Rachel  Okay sir, um-mm, let see if I got this right. Ah, so this is a half-caf,
double tall, easy hazel nut, non-fat, no foam, with whip, extra hot latte, right? (the guy
nods) Okay, great. (she starts to walk away and under her breath) You freak.
Ross  (to Gunther) Thank you.
Isabella  (to Gunther) Um, coffee to go, please.
Ross  Isabella Rosselini. (points to her)
Monica  Are you serious? (they all look) Oh my God.
Ross  Damn! I cant believe I took her off my list.
Monica  Why? Cause otherwise youd go for it?
Ross  Yeah, maybe.
Rachel  Oh-oh, you lie.
Ross  What you dont think Id go up to her?
Rachel  Ross, it took you ten years to finally admit you liked me.
Ross  Yeah, well missy, you better be glad that list is laminated.
Rachel  You know what honey, you go ahead, well call her an alternate.
Ross  Okay, hold my crawler.
Rachel  Okay.
Monica  Rach, are you really gonna let him do this?
Rachel  Honey, hes about to go hit on Isabella Rosselini. Im just
sorry we dont got popcorn.
Ross  (to Isabella) Hi! Hi, Im Ross, you dont know me, but Im
a big, big fan of yours. I mean, Blue Velvet, woo-oo hoo! Um, I was wondering if I
could um, maybe buy you a cup of coffee? (Gunther hands her change) Or maybe reimburse you
for that one?
Isabella  Arent you with that girl over there? (points at Rachel, who
waves back)
Ross  Well, yeah, kinda. Um, but thats okay, see we have an understanding,
um, see we each have this list of five famous people, (gets his out) so Im allowed
to sleep with you. No, no, no, its flattery.
Isabella  Im sorry. (starts to leave)
Ross  Oh no, no, no, wait, wait, Isabella. Dont, dont just dismiss
this so fast. I mean this is a once in a lifetime opportunity...
Isabella  Yeah, for you. Is that the list?
Ross  Um, yeah.
Isabella  May I see it?
Ross  Um, no.
Isabella  Come on! (grabs the list)
Ross  But, okay.
Isabella  (reading it) Im not on the list!
Ross  Um, see, but thats not the final draft.
Isabella  Its laminated!
Ross  Yeah, um, okay see, you were, you were on the list but my friend, Chandler
(Chandler waves) brought up the very good point that you are international, so I bumped
you for Wynona Rider, local.
Isabella  Y'know its ironic...
Ross  What?
Isabella  ...because I have a list of five goofy coffee house guys and yesterday
I bumped you for that guy over there. (points at a guy and leaves)
Ross  (to the rest of the gang) Were just gonna be friends.
[Scene  Chandler and Joeys, they are admiring the entertainment center]
Joey  Y'know what?
Chandler  Umm?
Joey  I bet ya ya I could fit in there. (points to a hole in the center)
Chandler  Ive got five bucks says you cant.
Joey  Get out your checkbook, mister.
Chandler  Oh, I think I have the cash.
Joey  You are dogged man! I totally fit!
Chandler  Yeah, you got me. (picks up a 2x4 and puts it through the handles so
that the doors wont open) Im out five big ones! (puts the money in the crack
between the door and frame) Here you go.
Joey  Thank you. Cha-ching! (Chandler starts to leave) Oh, well hello Mr.
Lincoln. Better luck next time buddy. (Chandler leaves and closes the door) And the drinks
are on me!
{Transcriber's Note  Rachel has two friends that are not named, so I referred to them
as Friend No. 1 and Friend No. 2.}
[Scene  Central Perk, the whole gang is there including Janice.]
Janice  Janice has a question. Who of the six of you has sleep with the six of
you?
Phoebe  Wow, its like a dirty math problem.
Ross  Im sorry the answer there would be...none of us.
Janice  Come on over the years none of you ever y'know, got drunk and stupid.
Joey  Well, thats really a different question.
Janice  Im sorry I find it hard to believe that a group of people who
spends as much time together as you guys do has never bumped uglies.
Joey  Well, there was that one time that Monica and Rachel got together.
Monica and Rachel  What?!!
Rachel  Excuse me, there was no time!
Joey  Okay, but lets say there was. How might that go?
Janice  Okay, okay, well then answer me this. Has any of you ever.... almost?
Rachel  Does anybody need more coffee?
Ross  Yeah, Ill take some.
Joey  Hey, theres a dog out there!
[Scene  Monica and Phoebes, three years earlier, Phoebe, Monica, and Ross are
there]
Phoebe  Oh, that is so unfortunate.
Ross  What?
Phoebe  Cute naked guy is really starting to put on weight.
Monica  (entering from bedroom) Okay, Ill be back in just a minute. Oh,
Phoebe Im sorry that I left lipstick marks on the phone.
Phoebe  You didnt leave lipstick marks on the phone.
Monica  Oh, then it mustve been you. Bye. (leaves)
Phoebe  (angrily) Bye-bye! (to Ross) Thats why I moved out.
Ross  Hey, y'know while were on that, when are you gonna tell my sister
that you dont live here anymore.
Phoebe  I think on some levels she already knows.
Ross  Phoebe, she doesnt know that you sneak out every night, she
doesnt know that you sneak back every morning, and she doesnt know that
youve been living with your Grandmothers for a week now.
Phoebe  Okay, well maybe not on those levels.
Chandler  (entering, with a goatee) Hey.
Ross  Hey.
Chandler  Im never gonna find a roommate, ever.
Phoebe  Why, nobody good?
Chandler  Well lets see, there was the guy with the ferrets, thats
plural. The spitter. Oh-ho, and yes, the guy that enjoyed my name so much he felt the need
to make a little noise every time he said it. Nice to meet you, Chandler Bing Bing!
Great apartment Chandler Bing, Bing!
Ross  So how many more do you have tomorrow?
Chandler  Two. This photographer, who seemed really dull. And this actor guy,
who Im not sure about, because when he called and I answered the phone
Chandler Bing, he said Whoa-whoa, short message.
Monica  (entering) Ross (who has his foot on the coffee table), foot on the
floor or come over no more!
Ross  (to Phoebe) Sure, your dresser is missing but this she notices.
Monica  What?
Ross  I have to go. Yeah, Carol should be home by now, soo...
Chandler  Umm, hows it going with you guys?
Ross  Oh, better, actually. Y'know I-I-I think I finally figured out why we were
having so much trouble lately.
Phoebe  Oh, really?
Ross  Yeah, y'know how I have you guys, well she doesnt really have any
close friends that are just hers, but last week she meet this woman at the gym, Susan
something, and they really hit it off, and I-I-I think its gonna make a difference
[Scene  Chandlers, Chandler is interviewing a potential roommate.]
Chandler  Soo, ah, Eric, what kind of photography do ya do?
Eric  Oh, mostly fashion, so there may be models here from time to time, I hope
thats cool.
Chandler  Yes, that is cool. Because I have models here y'know......never.
Eric  Oh, yeah, during the summer, I spend most weekends at my sisters
beach house, which you are welcome to use by the way. Although, I should probably tell
you, shes a porn star. (Chandler breaks his pencil in half)
Chandler  Well, listen I ah, still have one more person to ah meet, but unless
it turns out to be your sister, I think youre chances are pretty good. (Eric offers
to shake hands) All right. (Chandler hugs him.)
[Scene  Chandlers, Chandler is interviewing Joey.]
Chandler  (running around the apartment pointing out things) Bedroom. Bathroom.
Living room. This right here is the kitchen, and thanks for coming by, (opens door)
Bye-bye.
Joey  Dont you ah, dont you wanna ask me any questions?
Chandler  Sure. Ummm. Whats up?
Joey  Well, ah, Im an actor. Im fairly neat. I ah, I got my own TV.
Oh, and dont worry Im totally okay with the gay thing.
Chandler  What gay thing?
Joey  Ah, y'know just in general people being gay, thing. Im totally cool
with that.
[Scene  the hallway, Monica is coming up the stairs.]
Chandler  Well okay Jerry, thanks for stopping by.
Monica  Hi.
Joey  Hey!
[Scene  A bar, Chandler is entering.]
Chandler  Hey, Mon.
Monica  Hey-hey-hey. You wanna hear something that sucks.
Chandler  Do I ever.
Monica  Chris says theyre closing down the bar.
Chandler  No way!
Monica  Yeah, apparently theyre turning it into some kinda coffee place.
Chandler  Just coffee! Where are we gonna hang out now?
Monica  Got me.
Chandler  (to bartender) Can I get a beer.
Monica  Hey, did you pick a roommate?
Chandler  You betcha!
Monica  Is it the Italian guy?
Chandler  Um-mm, yeah right!
Monica  Hes so cute.
Chandler  Oh yes, and thats what I want a roommate that I can walk around
with and be referred to as the funny one.
Monica  Oh look, the pool tables free. Rack em up. Ill be back
in just a minute. Get ready for me to whip your butt.
Chandler  Okay, but after that, were shootin some pool.
Rachel  (sitting at a table with some of her friends) (to waitress) Oh, um, no,
no, no, no excuse me, hello. Hi. My friend ordered an onion, not an olive, and uh I
ordered a rum and Diet Coke, which I dont think this is.
Waitress  I am so sorry.
Rachel  Thats all right. (to her friends) I mean hard is it to get a
couple drinks right, huh?
Friend No. 1  Well, I would like to propose a toast to the woman, who in one
year from today, become Mrs. Dr. Barry Farber DDS
Rachel  Ummm, I think its time to see the ring again. (holds her hand out
and they all scream)
Friend No. 2  Oh, isnt it exciting, I mean its like having a
boyfriend for life.
Rachel  Yeah, I know.
Friend No. 1  What?
Rachel  Oh, I dont know. Well maybe its just the idea of Barry for
the rest of my life. I dont know I think I feel like I need to have one last fling,
y'know, just to sorta get it out of my system. (Chandler is listening in very intensely)
Friend No. 1  Rachel stop!
Friend No. 2  Youre so bad!
Rachel  Im serious, I really, I think I need just to have
some...meaningless, sex y'know, with the next guy that I see.
Chandler  Excuse, I seem to have dropped my ball.
Rachel  Yeah, so?
Chandler  (picks it up) And now Ive picked it up again. (walks over to
Monica.)
Monica  Oh my God, I went to high school with her. (to Rachel) Rachel! Hi!
Rachel  Monica! Look! Hi! What do ya think? (shows her, her ring)
Monica  Oh my God, you cant even see where the Titanic hit it.
Rachel  Yes, his name is Barry, hes a doctor, thank you very much.
Monica  Awww, just like you always wanted. Congratulations
Rachel  Thank you. So how-how bout you, are-are you seeing anybody?
Monica  Aww, not right now.
Rachel  Oh, but thats okay.
Monica  I know.
Rachel  Yeah.
Monica  So, Ill get-get back to my friend.
Rachel  Oh, yeah, sure, sure, sure, sure. (points at Chandler, who holds up the
cue ball as a Remember me? thing) Listen, can we please have lunch the next
time Im in the city?
Monica  Oh, thatd be great.
Rachel  Okay!
Monica  Thanks.
Rachel  Bye!
Monica  Bye! (to Chandler) Ten bucks says, I never see that woman again in my
life.
[Scene  Monica and Phoebes, Ross is on the phone, as Phoebe is walking by
carrying a lamp.]
Ross  No real-, honey, really its fine, just g-go with Susan. Really, I,
no, I think girls night out is a great idea. Okay, okay, bye
Phoebe  So what are they doing?
Ross  I dont know, something girlie.
Phoebe  (to Monica, whos entering) Hey, youre early.
Monica  What are you doing with the lamp?
Phoebe  Im just taking it to be re-wired.
Monica  Oh, well dont take it to the same place you took the stereo,
cause theyve had that thing for over a week.
Phoebe  No, no, Mr. Heckles no one is making any noise up here.
Mr. Heckles  Youre disturbing my oboe practice.
Phoebe  You dont play the oboe!
Mr. Heckles  I could play the oboe!
Phoebe  Then Im gonna have to ask you to keep it down. (slams the door in
his face.)
Mr. Heckles  (to Eric) Who are you?
Eric  Hi, Im Eric, Im gonna be Chandlers new roommate.
Mr. Heckles  Im Chandlers new roommate.
Eric  I-I-I dont think so.
Mr. Heckles  I could be Chandlers new roommate.
Eric  But, he told me over the phone.
Mr. Heckles  He told me in person.
Eric  Thats weird.
Mr. Heckles  Well, Im going to go into my new apartment now. (goes over to
the door and opens it) Ehh! (Eric leaves)
[Scene  the hallway, Joey is moving in, Monica is leaving.]
Monica  Hi, again.
Joey  Hey! (goes into the apartment)
Chandler  (leaving to go to work) Hey!
Monica  Thank you soo, much.
Chandler  Oh, dont thank me, thank the jerk that never showed up. Okay, I
gotta get to get to work.
Monica  You want some help with that?
Joey  Oh, no thanks, I got it. (picks it up) No I dont!
Monica  Whoa! Are you okay?
Joey  Whew! Stood up to fast, got a little head rush.
Monica  Its the heat. (has her hand on his chest, and then pulls it away)
And-and the humidity.
Joey  Thats a uh, thats a tough combination.
Monica  Do you wanna come in for some lemonade?
Joey  Like you wouldnt believe. (they go into the apartment) Wow! This is
a great place.
Monica  Thank you. Just make yourself comfortable.
Joey  Gotcha.
Monica  This place is really my Grandmothers. (Joey starts to take off all
of his clothes, while Monica gets the glasses and pours the lemonade.) I got it from her
when she moved to Florida, otherwise I could never afford a place like this. So if the
landlord ever asks, Im 87 year old woman, whos afraid of her VCR. So are you
thirsty?
Joey  Oh, you bet I am!
Monica  (turning around) Okay, heres your penis!
[Scene  continued from earlier.]
Monica  Oh my God!!! What are you doing?!!
Joey  You said, you wanna come in for some lemonade?
Monica  So?!
Joey  Whoa, ah!! Were you just gonna give me some lemonade?
Monica  Yeah huh!! Cover yourself up!
Joey  Oh right, right.
Monica  I dont believe this! When someone asks you in for lemonade, and to
you that means they wanna have sex?
Joey  Well usually...yeah! Well, not just lemonade, iced tea, sometimes juice.
Well, sorry, I just, I thought you liked me. Im such a jerk.
Monica  Its okay. I suppose it could happen to anyone, not anyone I know,
but... By the way I can still see it.
[Scene  Monica and Phoebes, Monica is vacuuming.]
Monica  Pheebs?
Phoebe  Huh?
Monica  Wheres your bed?
Phoebe  Its not in the apartment? (Monica gives a Come on
look) Oh no. I cant believe this is happening again.
Monica  What?
Phoebe  Okay, enough with the third degree! I-Ive, I dont live here
anymore.
Monica  What are you talking about?
Phoebe  Im sorry, I-I-I-I dont live here anymore. I-I didnt
know how to tell you, but y'know everybody else knows!
Monica  Everybody knows!
Phoebe  That was supposed to be a good thing, I forget why. Just listen, Monica,
I, do you know, okay, do you know, I couldnt sleep for like a month because I got
like a dot of ink on one of the sofa cushions.
Monica  Well, you-you coulda just turned the cushion over.
Phoebe  Yeah, I wouldve except I had a big spaghetti stain on the other
side.
Monica  What?!?!
Phoebe  Okay, this is what Im talking about, this. I-I need to live in a
land where people can spill.
Monica  You can spill. In the sink.
Phoebe  Aw, honey its not your fault, y'know this is who you are, and I
love you, and I want us to be friends, and if I keep living here I dont see that
happening.
Monica  I love you, too.
Phoebe  Aww, good. (they hug) What?
Monica  What? Im just said.
Phoebe  No youre not, youre wondering which cushion it is.
[Scene  Chandler and Joey's, (now) Joey is watching Baywatch, as Chandler enters
from his bedroom.]
Chandler  So ah, whatcha watching?
Joey  Baywatch.
Chandler  Whats it about?
Joey  Lifeguards.
Chandler  Well, it sounds kinda stupid... (looks at the TV) Whos she?
Joey  Nicole Eggert. You'll like her.
Chandler  Wow! Look at them run.
Joey  They do that a lot. Hey, you want a beer?
Chandler  Yeah, Ill go get one.
Joey  No, no, no, dont get up, I got a cooler right here.
[Scene  Monicas, Monica is coming out of the bathroom wearing nothing but a
towel, as Chandler is entering.]
Chandler  Well, hello!
Monica  Hey.
Chandler  Do you have any beers? Were out of beers.
Monica  (all depressed) Help yourself.
Chandler  You okay?
Monica  Phoebe moved out.
Chandler  Right.
Monica  I dont understand, I mean am I so hard to live, is this why I
dont have a boyfriend?
Chandler  Noo!! You dont have a boyfriend because....I dont, I
dont know why you dont have a boyfriend. You should have a boyfriend.
Monica  Well, I think so.
Chandler  Oh-ho, come here. (goes and hugs her) Listen, you are one of my
favourite people and the most beautiful woman Ive ever known in real life.
[Scene  the bar, Ross is entering, Phoebe is at the bar, they are the only two in the
place.]
Ross  (all depressed) Hi. Where is everybody?
Phoebe  Oh, its already closed, Chris gave me the keys to lock up-what is
wrong?
Ross  My marriage, I think my marriage is um, is kinda over.
Phoebe  Oh no! Why?
Ross  Cause Carols a lesbian. (Phoebe is shocked) And, and Im
not one. And apparently its not a mix and match situation.
Phoebe  Oh my God! I dont believe it! Oh, you poor bunny.
Ross  (sets out a bunch of shot glasses and starts to poor himself a drink, many
drinks) Im an idiot. I mean shoulda seen it, I mean Carol and Id be out and
shed, shed see some beautiful woman, and, and shed be Ross y'know look
at her, and Id think, God, my wife is cool!
Phoebe  Aw! Hey, do you think that Susan person is her lover?
Ross  Well, now I do!!
Phoebe  Im sorry.
Ross  Seven years. I mean weve been together seven years, shes the
only woman whos ever loved me, and the only woman Ive-Ive ever....
Phoebe  Aw, God Ross. Oh.(goes over and hugs him)
[Scene  Monicas, Chandler and Monica are still hugging each other.]
Chandler  Umm, this is nice.
Monica  I know, it is isnt it?
Chandler  No, I mean it, this feels really good. Is it a hundred percent cotton?
Monica  Yeah! And I got it on sale, too.
Chandler  Anyway, I should go, one of the lifeguards was just about to dismantle
a nuclear device.
Monica  Well, if you wanna get a drink later we can.
Chandler  Oh yeah, that sounds great. (starts to leave) Oh, and listen,
its, its gonna be....
Monica  I know. Thanks. (Chandler leaves)
[Scene  the bar, Phoebe is still hugging Ross.]
Ross  Maybe this wouldve happened if Id been more nurturing, or
Id paid more attention, or I... had a uterus. I cant believe this!
Phoebe  I know no, no, y'know you dont deserve this, you dont Ross.
Youre, youre really, youre so good. (kisses him on the cheek)
Ross  Thanks.
Phoebe  And youre so sweet. (kisses him on the other cheek) And
youre kind (kisses him on the lips)
Ross  Thanks. (kisses her on the lips)
Ross  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
Phoebe  Huh?
Phoebe  Okay, its okay.
Phoebe  Oh. (they start kissing again)
Ross  Wait, wait, wait.
Phoebe  What?
Ross  My foot is stuck in the pocket.
Phoebe  What?
Ross  No, I cant get it out.
Phoebe  Well, thats not something a girl wants to hear.
Ross  No, come on dont start. (they start kissing again) Ouch!
Phoebe  What?
Ross  Stupid balls are in the way. (holds up two balls)
Ross  Oh well. It probably wouldve been the most constructive solution.
Phoebe  You have chalk on your face.
Ross  Huh? (the rest of the gang enters)
Phoebe  Oh, Ross youre right, I dont know why I always thought this
was real grass.
Monica  Hey, are you okay?
Ross  My wifes a lesbian.
Joey  Cool!!
Chandler  Ross-Joey, Joey-Ross. (they shake hands)
Ross  Hi.
[Scene  the bar, Chandler is playing pool, as Rachel enters.]
Chandler  I cant believe you came back.
Rachel  Dont say anything. I dont wanna speak, I dont wanna
think. I just want you to take me and kiss me and make love to me right here, right now.
Friend No. 2  Rachel! Rachel! (stirs Rachel from her dream, shes in her
car driving back from the city)
Rachel  What?
Friend No. 2  You missed the exit!
Rachel  Oh, sorry.
Friend No. 1  My God, what were you thinking about?
Rachel  Um, (shyly) Barry.
Her Friends  Awwww!!
[Scene  Central Perk, the whole gang is there, Ross is telling a story about what
happened at work and the rest of the gang are thinking to themselves, denoted by italics.]
Ross  So I told Carl, Nobody, no matter how famous their parents are,
nobody is allowed to climb on the dinosaur. But of course this went in one ear and
out.....
Rachel  I love how he cares so much about stuff. If I squint I can pretend
hes Alan Alda.
Monica  Oh good, another dinosaur story. When are those gonna become extinct?
Chandler  If I was a superhero who could fly and be invisible, that
would be the best.
Gunther  What does Rachel see in this guy? I love Rachel. I wish she was my
wife.
Phoebe  Whos singing?
[Scene  Monica and Rachel's, the whole gang is there including Janice, theyre
watching Happy Days.]
Ross  Hey. When you guys were kids and you played Happy Days, who were
you? I was always Richie.
Monica  I was always Joanne.
Joey  Question. Was ah, Egg the Gellers! the war cry of your
neighbourhood?
Phoebe  Ewww! Oh! Its the Mattress King!
Joey  Booo!!
Chandler  (to Janice) Dont look honey. Change the channel! Change the
channel!
Janice  Wait! Wait! I wanna see this. After I divorce him, half of that kingdom
is gonna be mine.
Matress King  (on TV) Despair fills the mattress showroom. My kingdom
is suddenly without a queen. Im so depressed Im going to slash... my prices!!
Check it out! Four ninety-nine for a pillow top queen set! Im going medieval on
prices!
Chandler  What a wank!
Janice  Oh, I cannot believe hes using our divorce to sell mattresses.
Monica  I know! And four ninety-nine for a pillow top queen set, who cares about
the divorce, those babies will sell themselves. (they all stare at her) And Im
appalled for you by the way.
Matress King  (on TV) Im close. Im cheap. Im the king.
[Scene  Central Perk, Rachel is on the phone, everyone else is there except Joey.]
Rachel  Okay. (listens) Okay, daddy well see you tomorrow night.
(listens) Okay bye-bye. (hangs up)
Ross  We?
Rachel  Are ah, having dinner with my Dad tomorrow night, I hope thats
okay.
Ross  Oh shoot, tomorrows not so good, Im supposed to um, fall off
the Empire State building and land on a bicycle with no seat. Sorry.
Rachel  Ross, my father doesnt hate you.
Ross  Please, he refers to me as wethead.
Rachel  But honey he calls everybody by a nickname! Okay, look, I know, all
right, just one dinner, please, just one night for me, please. I just want him to love you
like I do. (Ross looks at her) All right, well not exactly like I do, but, but, if you do
come to dinner, Ill love you like I do in that black thing that you like.
Chandler  (leaning in) Ill go.
Ross  Fine.
Rachel  Thank you.
Ross  Hi Gunther.
Gunther  Yeah, well see!
Joey  (entering) Hey, you guys!
Phoebe  Hey!
Joey  Guess what?
Ross  What?
Joey  I got a gig!
All  Yay!!
Chandler  See, thats why I could never be an actor. Because I cant
say gig.
Phoebe  Yeah, I cant say croissant. (realises) Oh my God!
Monica  Whats the part?
Joey  Well, its not a part, no. Im teaching acting for soap operas
down at the Learning Extension.
Ross  Come on! Thats great.
All  Wow!
Joey  Yeah, yeah. Its like my chance to give something back to the acting
community.
Ross  Yknow your probably not allowed to sleep with any of your students.
Joey  (glares at him) I know!
[Scene  Mattress King, Monica and Phoebe are shopping for a new mattress.]
Phoebe  Ugh! I dont know Monica. It feels funny just being here. I mean if
you buy a bed from Janices ex-husband, thats like betraying Chandler.
Monica  Not at these prices.
Phoebe  (sees a little kid playing with a race car bed) (to kid) Hi. Y'know in
England this car would be on the other side of the store. (the kid just stares at her, and
she makes the that went right over your head motion) Woo!
Monica  (lying down on a mattress) Oh! Ohhhhh! Oh! Phoebe, come here. Aw, this
is my new bed. You gotta feel this bad boy.
Phoebe  Eh, Monica it, it feels so weird, y'know, Chandlers your friend...
(hops onto the bed) Oh! Oh my God! Aw, all right take this bed, you can make other
friends.
[Scene  Classroom. Joey is writing his name on the board, but turns around before
hes done which causes him to write his name with a downward curve, and he then
underlines it, and draws the line right through his name.]
Joey  Good evening. Im Mr. Tribbiani. And I will be teaching acting for
soap operas. Now um, on my first day as (proudly) Dr. Drake Remoray on Days of Our
Lives, (looks for a reaction from his students, and gets none.) I learned that one of
the most important things in soap opera acting is reacting, this does not mean acting
again, it means, you dont have a line, but someone else just did. And it goes like
this. (looks all intense for a moment and then gasps, the students cheer him) Thanks,
thanks, a lot. Oh, by the way, before I forget to work in soap operas some of you will
have to become much more attractive. All right, moving right along.
[Scene  Monica and Rachel's, Joey is entering, Phoebe is already there waiting for the
delievery guy.]
Joey  Hi!
Phoebe  Hey! Ooh! How was teaching last night?
Joey  Oh it was great. Yeah, you get to say stuff like, Hey, the bell
doesnt dismiss you, I dismiss you.
Phoebe  Ooooh, nice.
Joey  Oh, and guess what, I got an audition for All My Children.
Phoebe  Oh, yay!
Joey  Yeah, its this great part, this boxer named Nick. And Im so,
so right for it, y'know, hes just like me. Except hes a boxer, and has an evil
twin.
Phoebe  Oh. (goes and answers the door and there is this huge black
delievery guy.)
Guy  Dom da-da dom! Here ye! Here ye! Delivery from the Mattress King. (to
Phoebe) You Miss Geller?
Phoebe  Okay.
Guy  Sign here. (hands her a clipboard)
Phoebe  Oh, do I have a middle name. All right Monica Velula Geller. Its
that bedroom there. (points to Monicas room)
Joey  Hey, Monica bought a bed from the Mattress King?
Phoebe  Yeah, so please, please, please, dont say anything to Chandler.
Joey  You want me to lie to Chandler?
Phoebe  Is that a problem?
Joey  No.
Phoebe  Oh, hey, hey Nick the boxer lets see what you got. All right ya,
put em up. Come on. (they start shadow boxing)
Joey  Hey, youre ah, pretty good at this.
Phoebe  Yeah, well I had to learn, I was staying at the Y and some off the young
men werent acting Christian enough.
Joey  Ahh!
Joey  Hey now!
Joey  Hey!!! Oww!! And Im bleeding.
Phoebe  Oh! Oh! Oh!
Joey  Okay, great.
Phoebe  Wow! And Im a vegetarian! All right, all right, well Im
sorry, well put some ice on it.
Joey  Okay.
Phoebe  Kay, put your head back.
Joey  All right. I cant see.
Phoebe  All right, I have ya. Oh God.
Guy  Which bedroom do ya want it in Miss Geller?
Phoebe  Oh, its the compulsively neat one by the window, okay.
Guy  Gotcha. (he and his helper walk in carrying the racecar bed.)
[Scene  Restaurant, Rachel and Ross and Dr. Green are having dinner.]
Rachel  Hi Daddy!
Dr. Green  This where they put it? What, there no table available in the
kitchen! Hello, baby.
Rachel  You remember Ross.
Dr. Green  Um-hmm.
Ross  Nice to see you again Dr. Green.
Dr. Green  So! (they both try to sit next to Rachel but Dr. Green is
successful.) (to Ross) Hows the library?
Ross  Ugh, museum.
Dr. Green  What happened to the library?
Ross  There never was a library. I mean there are libraries, its just that I ah,
I never worked at one.
Dr. Green  You know whats really good here, the lobster. What do you say
shall I just order three.
Ross  Yeah, if youre really hungry. (Dr. Green stares at him) It was a
joke, I made a joke.
Rachel  Yeah, actually Daddy Ross is allergic to lobster.
Dr. Green  What kind of person is allergic to lobster? I guess the kind of
person that works at a library.
Ross  Its not a library...
Dr. Green  (interrupting him) I know!! Its a museum! What, youre the
only one around here who can make a joke! At least mine was funny. Ah, waiter, we will
have two lobsters and a menu. (nods at Ross, and mouths I dont know to the waiter.)
[Scene  After dinner.]
Ross  So, Dr. Green, hows the old boat.
Dr. Green  They found rust. You know what rust does to a boat?
Ross  It gives it a nice antiquey look.
Dr. Green  (he stares at Ross) Rust, is boat cancer, Ross.
Ross  Wow. Im sorry, when I was a kid I lost a bike to that. (Rachel
giggles at that)
Dr. Green  Excuse me for a moment, will you please, I want to say good night to
the Levines, before we go.
Rachel  Okay.
Ross  Okay! (picks up a knife and pretends to stab his heart.)
Rachel  Aw honey stop! Its not that bad.
Ross  Yeah. (sees the bill) Op! Uh-oh! I think your Dad mustve added
wrong. He only tipped like four percent.
Rachel  Yeah. Thats Daddy.
Ross  Thats Daddy?! But doesnt it bother you? Youre a
waitress.
Rachel  Yes, it bothers me Ross, but y'know if he was a regular at the coffee
house, Id be serving him sneezers.
Ross  So?
Rachel  So. Ross, Ive bugged him about this a million times, hes not
gonna change.
Ross  You really serve people sneezers?
Rachel  Well um, I dont.
Dr Green  You kids ready?
Ross  Thanks again, Dr. Green.
Dr. Green  All right.
Dr. Green  Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait, I think I forgot my receipt.
Ross  Oh, ah, you dont need that.
Dr. Green  Why not?
Ross  The carbon, its messy, I mean it gets on your fingers and causes,
the, the ah, night blindness.
Dr. Green  (gets his receipt and notices the twenty) What is this? Who put a
twenty down here? Huh?
Ross  Oh, yeah, that would be me, um, I have, I have a problem I-I tip way too
much, way, way, too much, its a sickness really.
Rachel  Yeah it is, it is. (to Ross) We really, really have to do something
about that.
Ross  I know.
Dr. Green  Excuse me, you think Im cheap?
Rachel  Oh Daddy, no he didnt mean anything by that, he really
didnt.
Ross  Nothing I do means anything, really.
Dr. Green  This is nice. I pay two hundred dollars for dinner, you put down
twenty, and you come out looking like Mr. Big Shot. You really want to be Mr. Big Shot?
Here, Ill tell you what, you pay the whole bill, Mr. Big Shot, all right. (rips up
the bill, and throws it at Ross, then leaves)
Ross  Well Mr. Big Shot is better than wethead.
[Scene  Classroom, Joey is lecturing on facial expressions.]
Joey  Okay, some tricks of the trade. Now, Ive never been able to cry as
an actor, so if Im in a scene where I have to cry, I cut a hole in my pocket, take a
pair of tweezers, and just start pulling. Or ah, or, lets say I wanna convey that
Ive just done something evil. That would be the basic I have a fishhook in my
eyebrow and I like it (Does it by raising one eyebrow, and showing off the pretend
fishhook.) Okay, lets say Ive just gotten bad news, well all I do there is try
and divide 232 by 13. (looks all confused) And thats how its done. Great soap
opera acting tonight everybody, class dismissed.
Student  Hey, Mr. Trib.
Joey  Hey-hey.
Student  Guess what, I got an audition!
Joey  Awww, one of my students got an audition. Im so proud.
Student  I was wondering if you would consider coaching me for it?
Joey  You bet! Whats the part?
Student  Oh its great, its a role on All My Children, Nick
the boxer.
[Scene  Hallway, Ross and Rachel are returning from dinner.]
Rachel  You had to do it, didnt you? You couldnt just leave it
alone.
Ross  Four percent. Okay. I tip more than that when theres a bug in my
food.
Rachel  Ross, tonight was about the two of you getting along. (Ross groans and
rubs his neck) Oh, would you just see my chiropractor, already.
Ross  Yeah, Im gonna go to a doctor who went to school in a mini-mall.
Ross  Hey Pheebs, what are you doing?
Phoebe  Im, Im freaking out! Monica kinda trusted me with something
and she shouldnt have! All right, I havent lived here in a while, so I have to
ask you something. Does Monica still turn on the lights in her bedroom?
Rachel  Um. yeah.
Phoebe  I am soo dead. (goes to Monicas room)
Rachel  All right, look, heres the bottom line Ross, this is fixable, if
we act fast, okay. So, Ill invite him to brunch tomorrow and you can make nice.
Ross  Look, honey, I have tried to make nice, it doesnt work.
Rachel  Okay, look, Ross, I realise that my Father is difficult, but thats
why you have got to be the bigger man here.
Ross  Look sweetie, I could be the bigger man, I could be the biggest man, I
could be a big, huge, giant man, and it still wouldnt make any difference, except
that I could pick your Father up and say Like me! Like me tiny doctor!
Rachel  Okay, well cant you just try it one more time Ross? For me? For
me?
Ross  Rachel one brunch is not gonna solve anything. You gotta face it, okay
were never gonna get along.
Rachel  Okay, well you are just gonna have too, okay. Because I already got a
Mother and a Father who cannot stay in the same room together, okay, I dont wanna
have to have a separate room for you too!! (starts to cry)
Ross  Okay, okay, okay. (hugs her) Ill get the bagels.
[Scene  Monicas bedroom, Phoebe is trying to hide the bed from Monica.]
Monica  (sees the bed) Whats this?
Phoebe  Isnt it cool! Varoom! Varoom!
Monica  This is not the bed I ordered!
Phoebe  I know, you mustve won like a contest or something!
Monica  Phoebe!
Monica  Why is this car in my bedroom?
Phoebe  Im sorry, okay, I-I wasnt looking, and the store says that
they wont take it back because you signed for it...
Monica  When did I sign for it?
Phoebe  When I was you! Y'know what, its all Joeys fault,
cause he left his nose open!
Monica  Did you make brownies today?
Chandler  Knock, knock.
Monica  (to Phoebe) Quick, take off your dress, he wont notice the bed.
Chandler  Hey, Im going for sushi does anybody want.. (enters and sees the
bed) Whoa-whoa, somebody missed the off ramp.
Phoebe  Its Monicas bed. What?
Chandler  Okay. (to Monica) Its a racecar.
Phoebe  So. This has always been Monicas bed, what youre just
noticing now, how self-involved are you?
Chandler  Okay, well it this bed isnt new, how come there is plastic on
the mattress?
Monica  Sometimes I have bad dreams. (starts to break down, and Phoebe offers
her, her hand to comfort her.)
[Scene  Classroom, Joey is coaching his student.]
Student  Look, I just saw my best friends brains smeared across the canvas,
thats not gonna be me, not me.
Joey  Wow! That was good. That was...(points to his pocket) Tweezers?
Student  No.
Joey  Whoa. That was really good.
Student  Thanks, any suggestions?
[Scene  Central Perk, Chandler, Monica, and Phoebe are there, yelling at Joey.]
Chandler  You told him to play the boxer gay!!
Joey  Well, I-I mightve said supergay.
Chandler  You totally screwed him over.
Monica  Joey, youre this guys teacher. I mean how could you do this?
Joey  Because, Monica, the guys so good, and I really, really want this
part.
Phoebe  Well, if you really, really want it, then its okay.
[Scene  Monica and Rachel's, Rachel is greeting her Father for their brunch.]
Rachel  (opening the door) Hi Daddy.
Dr. Green  Baby. Ross.
Ross  Dr. Green. How are you? (offers his hand, and Dr. Green puts his scarf on
it.)
Dr. Green  Thanks for dinner last night.
Ross  Thank you for teaching me a valuable lesson.
Dr. Green  Nice hair. Whatd ya do? Swim here?
Ross  (to Rachel) Okay, thats it, I cant take it anymore.
Rachel  What? What? Hes interested in you. He-he likes your hair, he just
wants to know how you got here.
Ross  Oh, please. Sweetie its hopeless, okay, Im just gonna go.
(starts to leave rubbing his neck)
Rachel  What?!
Ross  Look, look Im sorry. Its just that....
Dr. Green  Ross? Whats with the neck?
Rachel  Hes got this thing. And I keep telling him to go to my
chiropractor...
Dr. Green  Youre still going to that chiropractor, that man couldnt
get into medical school in Extapa!
Ross  Thank you! Thats what I keep saying.
Rachel  Excuse me, Dr. Bobby happens to be an excellent doctor.
Ross  Uh.
Dr. Green  Wait a minute, his name is Dr. Bobby?
Rachel  Well thats his last name.
Ross  And his first name.
Dr. Green  Hes Bobby Bobby?
Rachel  Its Robert Bobby.
Dr. Green  Oh.
Rachel  And um, excuse me, he helps me.
Ross  Oh-ho please. Ask her how?
Dr. Green  What do you need help for?
Rachel  With my alignment. Ive got one leg shorter than the other.
Dr. Green  Oh God!
Ross  Argue with that.
Rachel  What? Its true, my right leg is two inches shorter.
Dr. Green  Come on! Youre just titling! (to Ross) Her legs are fine!
Ross  I know that!
Dr. Green  So, why do you let her go to a chiropractor for?
Rachel  Im sorry, let her?
Ross  What can I do, she doesnt listen to me about renters insurance
either.
Dr. Green  Wait a minute, you dont have renters insurance?!
Rachel  No.
Dr. Green  Well what if somebody steals something? How are you gonna run after
him with one leg shorter than the other?!
Ross  Hey, would you ah, would you like some juice?
Dr. Green  Id love some juice. Thanks.
Ross  Okay. (to Rachel) Wow! This is going so well. Did you see us? Did you see?
Rachel  Yeah honey, Im standing right there! Why didnt you just tell
him about the mole I havent got checked yet.
Ross  Excellent!
[Scene  Classroom, Joey is talking to his students.]
Joey  (sadly) There will come a time in each of your careers when youll
have a chance to screw over another soap opera actor. I had such an opportunity in the
recent, present. And Im ashamed to say that I took it, I advised a fellow actor to
play a role, homosexually. Yeah, we both auditioned for the part, and uh, as it turned
out, they ah, they liked the stupid gay thing and cast him. And now, hes got a two
year contract opposite Susan Luchhi, the first lady of daytime television, and me, me
Im stuck here teaching a bunch of people, most of whom are too ugly to even be on
TV. Im sorry, Im sorry, Im sorry. (he gets a huge round of applause from
his students.) Thank you.
[Scene  Mattress King, Monica is trying to return her bed.]
Jester  Uh, may I help you?
Monica  Yeah, I talked to you on the phone, Im the lady that got stuck
with the racecar bed.
Jester  Look, its like I told you, theres nothing I can do. You
signed for it, Monica Velula Geller.
Joey  All right, Jester man, look we wanna see the king.
Jester  Nobody sees the king!
Joey  Oh-ho-kay, Im talking to the king. (starts to go to a back room)
Jester  Hey! You cant go back there!
Janice  Oh my God.
[Scene  Monicas bedroom, Chandler is playing with the bed.]
Chandler  Varrrrrroom! Hey! Watch it lady! Varrrrrrrrrrom! (makes a screeching
sound as he pretends to stomp on the brakes.) Hey-hey good lookin! (honks the
beds little horn on the steering wheel.) Varrrrrrrrroom. (notices Rachel and stops)
All right, Ill leave. My beds so boring.
[Scene  Monica and Rachel's, Phoebe, Chandler, and Ross are there, Rachel
is serving brownies.]
Rachel  Here you go Pheebs. Who else wants one of my special homemade brownies?
Chandler  I will have one. (Ross and him both take one.)
Chandler  Okay, Im not gonna have one.
Ross  Neither will I. (they both put back the brownies.)
Phoebe  No, no, its just my tooth.
Chandler  All right Ill have one. (he and Ross take another brownie,)
Ross  So whats a matter, you need a dentist? Ive got a good one.
Phoebe  No thanks, I have a good one too. I just, I, I cant see him.
Chandler  See that is the problem with invisible dentists.
Ross  Why? Why cant you go to him?
Phoebe  Because, every time I go to the dentist, somebody dies.
Chandler  That is so weird, because every time I go to the dentist, I look down
the hygienists blouse.
Rachel  Phoebe, what? Umm...what?!
Phoebe  Yeah, yeah, first there was my aunt Mary, and then there was umm, John,
my mailman, and then my, my cowboy friend Albino Bob.
Rachel  And all these people actually died?
Phoebe  Yes, while I was in the chair! Thats why I take such good care of
my teeth now, y'know, its not about oral hygiene, I floss to save lives!
Ross  Pheebs, come on, you didnt kill anybody, these people just happened
to die when you went to the dentist. Its, its, its just ah, a
coincidence.
Phoebe  Well tell that to them. Oh! You cant, their dead.
[Scene  Central Perk, Ross, Rachel, and Phoebe are there.]
Ross  Thanks, Gunther. (takes the plate Gunther serves him and Rachel comes up
and kisses him) (to Rachel) Hey! (to Gunther) Umm, can I get a napkin too?
Gunther  Oh, like you dont already have everything.
Phoebe  (trying to bite into an apple) Ow! Ow! (drops the apple in disgust.)
Rachel  Phoebe, your in pain, would you just go to the dentist, just go.
Phoebe  All right, fine, fine, but if youre my next victim, dont
come back as a poltergeist and like suck me into the TV set.
Rachel  I promise.
Phoebe  Although, dont feel like you cant visit.
Joey  (entering with Monica) Hey, is, is, is Chandler here?
Ross  (patting his clothes like he is looking for his wallet) No, no hes
not.
Monica  You guys, Joey just saw Janice kissing her ex-husband.
Ross  What? (to Joey) So what are you going to do? I mean how, how are you going
to tell Chandler?
Joey  Well, I was thinking about that and I, I think the best way would be, to
not.
Rachel  Joey, you cant keep this to yourself, if you know about this, you
have to tell him.
Joey  Itll kill him. I mean itll, itll just kill him.
Phoebe  Well, you could wait til I go to the dentist, maybe Ill
kill him.
[Scene  Monica and Rachel's, All are there except for Chandler.]
Joey  (looking out the window) Ewww! Ugly Naked Guy is using his new hammock.
Its like a Play-Doo Fat Factory.
Phoebe  Well, Im going to the dentist, so listen, okay, just be on the
look out for anything that, that, that you can fall into, or, or that can fall on you,
or... All right, just look out! Okay, And um, I also just wanna, I just wanna tell you all
that um...... (starts to cry and runs out)
Ross  Okay, I have a problem I have to go into work for a few hours, some kids
messed up the Homo Sapien display.
Joey  What did they do?
Ross  Well, they painted over the word Sapien for one thing, then
they rearranged the figures, lets just leave it at that.
Monica  So, do you want me to watch Ben for you?
Ross  Yes, thats what I was going to ask, thank you.
Rachel  Whoa! Wait! Hello! What about me?
Ross  You? You! Want to watch Ben? (in the background Monica mouths
Dont worry, Ill be here the whole time. to Ross.) Yes! Thatd
be great, no, I just wanted to ask Monica, because I know how empty her life is. (Monica
sarcastically mouths Yeah! and holds up her thumb.)
Joey  Hey-hey, Ross?
Ross  Yeah.
Joey  Ive got a science question.
Ross  Hmm?
Joey  If the Homo Sapiens, were in fact Homo-sapien, is that why
there extinct?
Ross  Joey, Homo Sapiens are people.
Joey  Hey-hey, Im not judging.
[Scene  Monica and Rachel's, Monica and Rachel are babysitting Ben.]
Rachel  (holding Ben) Look Benny, spoon. (moves it back and forth) Spoon. Come
on! All right, y'know what I think hes bored.
Monica  Here. Ben, do you wanna play the airplane game, do you wanna show
Rachel? Come here. (takes Ben) Were gonna do something fun. Okay. (throws Ben up in
the air a little bit and catches him) Weee!! (moves into the living room and does it
again) Weee!! (starts to walk back into the kitchen as she does it again, and hits
Bens head on that wooden beam across the ceiling.)
Monica  (to Ben) Whos so brave, youre so brave, yes you are,
youre so brave.
Rachel  Okay. Okay honey, hes fine, hes fine, lets just put
him down. Come here, Ben. (sets him on the couch) See thats a good boy. (to Monica)
How could you do that to him!! Ross trusted me, what is he going to say?!
Monica  Hes not gonna say anything, because were not gonna tell him.
Rachel  Were not?!
Monica  No were not.
Rachel  All right, I like that.
Monica  Okay.
Rachel  So were okay, were okay, were okay, (starts to exam
Ben) arent we? No, were not okay, were not okay, theres a bump,
theres a bump.
Monica  Oh my God! Well push it in! Push it in!
Rachel  I cannot push it in!
Monica  Okay, were gonna need a distraction.
Rachel  Okay, okay, okay.
Monica  I got it!
Rachel  Okay.
Monica  The second that Ross walks in that door, I want you take him back to
your bedroom and do whatever it is that you do that makes him go, (high pitched) rweee!!
Rachel  Or. We could put a hat on his head.
Monica  A hat! Yes! We need a hat.
Rachel  We need a hat..
Monica  Where are we gonna find a tiny little hat?
Rachel  Oh, oh, oh, Ill get Rainy Day Bear!! (runs to get him)
Monica  Because hell know what to do? (Rachel comes out of her room with a
bear thats dressed in a rain suit.) Oh my God, youre a genius!
Rachel  Oh God, oh God, its sowed on though.
Monica  Give it. Give it.
Rachel  Okay.
Monica and Rachel  Oh!!
Rachel  Oh, its just like a bloodbath in here today.
[Scene  The street, Chandler and Joey are walking past a jewelery store.]
Chandler  Hey! Hold on a minute, hold on a second. Do you think these pearls are
nice?
Joey  Id really prefer a mountain bike.
Chandler  Janices birthday is coming up, I want to get her something
speacial. Come in here with me.
Joey  Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait, whoa. Do you ah, want to get her something
speacial, get her flowers, get her candy, get her gum, girls love gum.
Chandler  Thats a good idea, Dear Janice have a Hubba-Bubba
birthday. I would like to get her something serious.
Joey  Oh, you want something serious. Y'know what you should do, you should get
her one of those um, barium enemas. Those are dead serious.
Chandler  All right. Look, Im gonna go in here, and you dont buy me
anything ever. (starts to go into the store)
Joey  (stopping him) No, no, you cant, you cant, okay, you
cant, you cant buy her pearls, you just cant, you cant, you
cant.
Chandler  Why not?!
Joey  Oh God. Uh, okay, heres the thing, this is the thing, okay, the
thing is...
Chandler  What is the thing?
Joey  Okay. I went down to the Mattress King showroom and, and I saw
Janice, kissing her ex-husband.
Chandler  (shocked) What?
Joey  They were in his office.
Chandler  Well she, she wouldnt do that, shes with, shes with
me.
Joey  Im telling you man, I saw it.
Chandler  Yeah, well, youre wrong! Okay, youre wrong.
Joey  Im not wrong! I wish I was. Im sorry. Bet that barium enema
doesnt sound so bad now, huh?
[Scene  Monica and Rachel's, Monica and Rachel are dressing up Ben in the entire rain
suit from Rainy Day Bear.]
Monica  It just makes more sense as an ensemble.
Rachel  Right.
Monica  Besides, it takes the focus off the hat.
Phoebe  (running through the door) No! Oh! Youre alive! Youre alive!
Rachel  See Pheebs, I promised you no one would die, didnt I?
Phoebe  Yeah, well, well see about that. Can I use your phone? I just
wanna call everyone I know.
Monica  Sure, we have no money, go ahead.
Phoebe  (on phone) Hey! Youre not dead! Okay, see ya!
Ben  Monica.
Monica  Oh my God! He just said my name! Did you hear that?
Ben  Monica bang!
Rachel  Okay, I heard that.
Monica  Did he just say Monica bang?
Rachel  Uh-huh.
Monica  Oh my God! Hes gonna rat me out!
Ben  Monica bang!
Monica  Oh-ho-ho, sweetie, sweetie, you gotta stop saying that, now. Its
no big deal, its not even worth mentioning, you see we all do it all the time. See
watch this, Ben, Ben, Ben. (goes over and starts hitting her head on the post) Ow, Monica
bang! (does it again) Everybody bang. (repeats) Ben bang. (repeats) Rachel bang. (repeats)
Bang, Rachel bang! Oh, isnt that fun?
Rachel  (goes over and hits her head on the post) Look at that! (repeats) Look
at that! (repeats) We all do it. (repeats) Okay, Im stopping now.
Monica  You okay?
Rachel  Oh yeah! Y'know, if its not a headboard, its just not worth
it.
[Scene  Chandler and Joey's, Chandler is waiting for Janice to arrive, and is angrily
fllipping through a magazine.]
Janice  (entering) Hows my Bing-a-ling?
Chandler  Ah, I dont know, you tell me. Anything you ah, wanna tell me,
because, if you ah, you should, if you, you would, tell me.
Janice  Why are your eyes so white?
Chandler  You tell me! Maybe, its because I was just fooling with my ex!
Oh no-no-no-no, no-no-no-no, that was you!!
Janice  Oh my God!!
Chandler  All right!
Janice  How did you know?
Chandler  Joey told me, he saw you two kissing.
Janice  In the park?
Chandler  No! In his office! How many kisses were there?
Janice  Just those two!
Chandler  Wh-wh-why, wh-why, why, why was there kissing!? There should be no
kissing!!
Janice  Oh, Im sorry honey, Im so, so, (nasally) haaaaa! Im
so, so sorry, I just (nasally) haaaaaa! But I, oh what happened was, I-I-I cant
breathe. Can you get me a bag, or something?
Chandler  (giving her a bag) Here.
Janice  The receipt.
Chandler  Ill take it! All right look, I gotta know. Are you finished with
me? (Janice shakes her head no) Are you finished with him? (Janice shakes her head no) Do
you still love him? (Janice shakes her head yes) Do you still love me? (Janice shakes her
head yes) All right look, (grabs the bag) Im gonna need an actual answer here okay,
so which is it, him or me? (his phone starts to ring)
Janice  I dont know.
Phoebe  (rushing in) Okay. If youre alive you answer your phone!
[Scene  Monica and Rachel's, Monica, Rachel, Phoebe, and Joey are there.]
Monica  Okay, Ben, I wont tell your daddy that you had ice cream for
dinner, if you dont tell about our little bonking incident.
Rachel  Monica, number one, I dont think Ben understands the concept of
bribery, and number two, I... (Joey starts laughing in the background) (to Joey) What?!
Joey  You said number two.
Rachel  I also said number one.
Joey  I know. (giggles harder)
Ross  (entering) Hey! Everyone.
Rachel  Hi!
Ross  Hows my little boy?
Rachel  Hes perfect, hes never been better.
Ross  (noticing the outfit he is wearing) Whatd you do, take him whaling?
Ben  Monica.
Ross  Oh my God, he just said your name, thats great! Good job Ben.
Ben  Monica bang!
Monica  Oh thats right, thats what Id sound like if I
exploded.
Phoebe  Woo-Hoo! The curse is broken! I called everybody I know, and everyone is
alive.
Joey  Uh.
Phoebe  What?
Joey  Ugly Naked Guy looks awfully still. (Phoebe runs to the window and gasps.)
Phoebe  Oh my God! I killed him! I killed another one! And this curse is getting
stronger too, to bring down something that big.
Rachel  Well maybe hes just taking a nap.
Joey  Im tellin ya, he hasnt moved since this morning.
Monica  All right, we should call somebody.
Ross  And tell them what? The naked guy we stare at all the time isnt
moving.
Rachel  Well, we have gotta find out if hes alive.
Monica  How are we gonna do that? Theres no way.
Joey  Well, there is one way. His windows open, I say, we poke him.
[Scene  Chandler and Joey's, Chandler is throwing darts, as Joey enters.]
Joey  Hey! Y'know how we ah, save all those chopsticks for no reason we get when
we get Chinese food?
Chandler  Yeah.
Joey  Well, now we got a reason.
Chandler  What?
Joey  Well, were fashioning a very long poking device.
Chandler  All right.
Joey  Hey uh, whats a matter?
Chandler  I talked to Janice.
Joey  Oh my God, is she going back to him?
Chandler  She doesnt know. Says she loves us both. Y'know I woke up this
morning and I was in love, well I was happy. Y'know it serves me right for buying that
twelve pack of condoms. And now I cant even return them, because she choked on the
reciept!
Joey  What are you ah, what are you gonna do?
Chandler  I dont know, y'know. What, what, would you do?
Joey  Well, it doesnt matter what I would do.
Chandler  Come on, tell me.
Joey  All right, youre probably not gonna want to hear this but ah, if it
was me, and this is just me, (Chandler gets ready to throw another dart) I would ah, I
would bow out.
Chandler  What? (turns around quickly still ready to throw the dart and Joey
quickly ducks and hides behind the chair) What are you, what are you talking about?
Joey  They have a kid together, y'know. Theyre like, theyre like a
family, and if, I dont know, theres chance they could make that work, I know I
wouldnt want to be the guy who stood in the way of that. Are you okay? Do you wanna
ah, come poke a nude guy?
[Scene  Monica and Rachel's, Ross has just finished putting Ben to sleep, and is
entering from Rachels room.]
Ross  Well, hes finally alseep. About that ah, bump on his head?
Rachel  Are you, are you, are you sure its ah, a new bump? I mean, no
offense, Ive always thought of Ben as a fairly bumpy headed child.
Ross  Its okay if he bumps his head, kids bump their heads all the time,
y'know, it was your first time babysitting, I figured you did the best you could.
Rachel  (confidently) I did!
Ross  I know! Im saying you have to watch them all the time.
Rachel  I did!! I watched! I watched! I watched Monica bang his head against
that thing!
Ross  Monica did it?
Ross  Monica?
Monica  Yeah.
Ross  Umm, did you notice anything wierd about Ben today?
Monica  No. Why?
Ross  Well, I was just playing with him, and y'know we were doing the alphabet
song, which he used to be really good at, but suddenly hes leaving out e
and f. Its like they just ah, I dont know, fell out of his head.
Monica  Really?!
Ross  Oh, and also, hes, hes walkin kind of funny, his left
leg is moving a lot faster than his right leg, and hes in there just sort of
y'know... (walks around in a circle)
Monica  Oh my God, I wrecked your baby!! (runs into the bedroom)
Rachel  I hope its still funny when youre in hell.
Monica  (coming out of the bedroom) You jerk! You know how much I love that kid!
(starts to chase Ross around the living room)
Ross  Monica bang! Monica bang! (runs into one of the posts) Ow!
Rachel  Ill get the hat.
[Scene  Central Perk, Chandler and Janice are there.]
Chandler  Janice, I have something I need to tell you, and I want you to let me
get through it, because its, its, its not gonna be easy.
Janice  Okay.
Chandler  I think you should go back with Gary. I dont wanna be the guy
that breaks up a family, y'know when my parents split up, it was because of that guy.
Whenever I would see him I was always think y'know Youre the reason, you are
the reason why their not together. and I hated that guy. And it didnt matter
how nice he was, or how happy he made my Dad.
Janice  Wow!
Chandler  Yeah, well. Its the right thing to do.
Janice  Oh! Youre right. Oh God. But, before I can say
good-bye, theres something I really need you to know, Chandler. The way
I feel about you, its like, I finally understand what Lionel Richies been
singing about. Y'know, I mean what we have, its like movie love, youre my
soulmate, and I cant believe were not going to be spending the rest of our
lives together.
Chandler  Then dont leave me!
Janice  What?
Chandler  Forget what I said, I was babbling! Pick me!
Janice  No, you were right, you were right. I mean, I-I-Ive got to give my
marriage another chance.
Chandler  No you dont! No, no, no, I say you have to give your divorce
another chance.
Janice  (standing up) Im sorry. (hugs him)
Chandler  Ohhh. Dont go.
Janice  No, I-I-I gotta go. (she starts to walk away, but Chandler doesnt
let her go.)
Chandler  No. No! No! No!
Janice  Honey, honey, people are looking.
Chandler  I dont care! (turns around and to the people watching them) I
dont care!!
Janice  Yeah, um, Im, Im leaving now. (tries to get her leg out of
Chandlers grasp, she finally does, but Chandler takes off her shoe.)
Chandler  You cant leave! I have your shoe!
Janice  Good-bye Chandler Bing. (walks out with one shoe)
Gunther  Rachel has those in burgendy.
[Scene  Monica and Rachel's, Joey, Rachel, Monica, Phoebe, and Ross are holding the
giant poking device.]
Joey  All right now remember, something this big and long is going to be
difficult to manuver, fortunately I have a lot of experience in that area.
Ross  Can we please focus here, a naked mans life hangs in the balance!
Phoebe  Im telling you hes dead. What we are about to have here is a
dead fat guy on a stick.
Joey  All right, ladies and gentlemen, lets poke. (they start to advance
the giant poking device) Steady. Steady. Okay, a little higher. Careful of the angle.
Okay, okay, were approaching the window (as he says this the camera cuts to their
view of Ugly Naked Guy, so that we actually see him!) Thread the needle. Thread the
needle.
Phoebe  Hes alive! Hes a-live!!!
Monica  And yet, were still poking him.
Joey  Okay, retract the device, retract the device.
Ross  He does not look happy.
Rachel  Hey-hey, now hes showing us his poking device.
Joey  Hey, thats never gonna make it all the way over here, buddy!
[Scene  Chandler and Joey's, Chandler is listening to a Lionel Richie album]
Chandler  (singing) Ill hold you close in my arms. (Phoebe
enters) I cant resist your charms. And love....
Phoebe  (joining him) Love....
Chandler and Phoebe  Ill be a fool for you. Im sure, you know I
dont mind.
Chandler  (high pitched) No you know I dont mind.
Chandler and Phoebe  Yes! You mean the world the world to me. Oh...
Chandler  I know.
Phoebe  I know.
Chandler  Ive found.
Phoebe  Ive found....
Chandler and Phoebe  ...in you, my endless (Phoebe goes high pitched,
Chandler goes low pitched) love. (they both look at each other.) My endless
love. (once again they dont match tones, and they just look at each other)
[Scene  Monica and Rachel's, the whole gang is there, the guys are
watching football, the girls are cooking Thanksgiving dinner.]
The Guys  (reacting to a play) Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Awww!
Phoebe  Hey, its your Thanksgiving too, y'know, instead of watching
football, you could help.
The Guys  We will. (they dont move)
Monica  Okay, Rachel, you wanna put the marshmellows in concentric circles.
Rachel  No Mon, you want to put them in concentric circles. I want
to do this.
Monica  Every year.
[Scene  Monica and Rachel's, continued from earlier.]
Phoebe  Y'know, for once, I am going to sit down and try to watch one of these
things. (just as she sits down).
Ross  Halftime.
Joey  Hey, who wants to ah, throw the ball around a little, maybe get a little
three on three going?
Rachel  Oh! That would be sooo much fun!
Phoebe  Oh, can I play too? Ive never played football, like ever.
Joey  Great, you can cover Chandler.
Chandler  No, no, no, I dont, I dont really wanna play.
Joey  Come on man! You never want to do anything since you and Janice broke up.
Chandler  Thats not true! I wanted to wear my bathrobe and eat peanut
clusters all day. I wanted to start drinking in the morning. Dont say that I
dont have goals!
Joey  Chandler, you have to start getting over her. All right, if you play, you
get some fresh air, maybe itll take your mind off Janice, and if you dont
play, everyone will be mad at you cause the teams wont be even. Come on.
Chandler  Yeah, all right, Ill play.
Phoebe  Yay!!
Rachel  Lets do it! Ross?
Ross  What?
Rachel  Do you wanna play football?
Ross  Um, Monica and I arent supposed to play football.
Joey  Says who? Your mom?
Monica and Ross  Yeah.
Monica  Well, every, every Thanksgiving um, we used to have a touch football
game called the Geller Bowl.
Chandler  No, no, no, you say that proudly.
Monica  Anyway, Ross and I were always captains, and um, it got kindve
competitive and one year, Geller Bowl VI, I accidentally broke Rosss nose.
Ross  It was soo not an accident. She saw I was about to tag her, so she
threw her big fat grandma arm elbow right into my face. And just keep running.
Monica  To score the winning touchdown, by the way.
Ross  Whoa, whoa, whoa, ho, ho, ho, you did not win the game, the touchdown
didnt count, because of the spectacularly illegal, oh and by the way savage nose
breaking.
Monica  (to Chandler and Joey) I won the game.
Ross  Oh yeah! Then how come you didnt get the Geller Cup?
Rachel  Um, there was a Geller Cup?
Ross  Yes, it was the trophy you got if you won the game. But our Dad said,
nobody won that game,  and he was sick of our fighting, so he took the trophy
and.... (pauses to collect himself, as he is on the verge of tears saying this) threw it
in the lake.
Chandler  And was the curse lifted?
Ross  Anyway. Thats when our Mom said we were not to play football ever
again.
Monica  Y'know what, I think we should play a game. I mean come on, its
been twelve years.
Ross  Can I see you for a second?
Monica  (shouting) Once!!
Ross  All right, were gonna play.
Chandler  But wait a minute though, how are we gonna get there, though, because
my Mom wont let me cross the street.
[Scene  The Park, the gang is warming up for their football game.]
Monica  Okay. Lets bring it in.
Rachel  Wait no, honey, honey throw it to me, throw it to me.
Ross  Here you go. (throws her the ball)
Rachel  (knocking it down instead of catching it) That almost hit me in the
face.
Joey  All right, we have to pick captains.
Chandler  And then Tineals.
Phoebe  Okay, so how do we decide that?
Monica  Well, why dont we just bunny up.
Rachel, Chandler, and Joey  What?
Monica and Ross  (holding both of their hands above their heads making rabbit
ears with their fingers.) Bunny!
Monica  Okay, looks like Ross and I are captains. Okay, so um, I bunnied first
so that means I get to pick first. Joey.
Joey  Thank you.
Rachel  Monica, Im your best friend.
Ross  Sweetie, dont worry youll get picked. Chandler.
Rachel  Ross!
Monica  Phoebe.
Ross  Sweetie, now I pick you.
Rachel  You dont pick me! Youre stuck with me!
Ross  Okay. All right. So lets see, lets play from the trash can, to
the lightpost. Right. Two hand touch, well kick off.
Monica  All right people listen, Ive got exactly twenty-eight minutes
before I have to baste again.
Chandler  Wow! Just like in the pros.
Monica  Huddle up.
Joey  (to his team) All right, huddle up, right over here.
Phoebe  Wait for me! Wait for me! Wait for me! Oh cool, this is my first huddle.
Monica  Okay.
Phoebe  Okay, so what do you guys really think of Chandler?
Monica  Okay, Phoebe you know what youre doing right?
Phoebe  Yeah.
Monica  Okay, Joeys gonna catch it, and you and I are gonna block.
Phoebe  Whats block?
Monica  Phoebe, I thought you said you know what youre doing?
Phoebe  I thought you meant in life.
Monica  Break.
Chandler  The ball is Janice. The ball is Janice. (goes to kick the ball but
kicks Rosss foot instead.)
Ross  Oww!! Son of a...!! Ow! Come on!
Chandler  Sorry. Im sorry. Y'know what, were just gonna throw it.
Joey  I got it. (catches the ball)
Phoebe  Go! Go! Go!
Monica  Score!! 7 to nothing!
Rachel  (coming over to Ross, who is just getting up) Are you okay?
Ross  Come on, lets go!
Monica  Losers walk!
Ross  Yeah, losers talk!
Chandler  No, no, no, actually losers rhyme.
Chandler  (coming up under center, just like a real quarterback does, and puts
his hands between Rosss legs.) Twenty-three!! Seventy-four!! (Ross stands up and
looks at him) You wanna go shotgun?
Ross  Yeah!
Chandler  (from the shotgun) Hike!
Monica and Joey  One-Mississippi. Two-Mississippi. Three-Mississippi.
Rachel  Over here!
Rachel  (proud of her self) I almost caught that one!
Chandler  Great! Now, the score is 7 to almost 7.
Ross  Okay, (to Chandler) this play, I want you to do a down and out to the
right. Okay. Break!
Rachel  Wait, what am I gonna do?
Ross  You, you go long.
Rachel  Wait, how long?
Ross  Until we start to look very small.
Rachel  Okay.
Ross  Break!!
Joey  Set....hike!
Ross  One-Mississippi, two-Mississippi, switch! Switch! Switch!!
Chandler  No, no, no, no, no!
Joey  Haaaaa! Hey-hey, thanks for stopping our ball.
Woman  (in a foreign accent) You are playing American football?
Joey  Yeah! Wow, your like from a whole other country.
Woman  Im Dutch.
Joey  Hi-hi, Im Joey.
Woman  Im Margha.
Joey  Im sorry Dutch, I didnt get that last little bit.
Chandler  (running up) Hey Joey, do you wanna play football or you wanna.. (sees
Marhan) Hi, Im Chandler.
Margha  Hello, Chandler.
Joey  Her name is Dutch, and also Marklan.
Margha  Margha.
Joey  Mar-klan.
Margha  Mar-gha.
Chandler  Mar-haaaan.
Monica  Come on guys! Lets go! Come on, its second down.
Ross  Uh, hello, its third down.
Monica  No its not, its second.
Ross  Wow!
Monica  Wow, what?
Ross  It just amazes me that your still pulling stuff like this.
Monica  Pulling what? Its second down.
Ross  Okay, its second down. (turns away) Take all the second downs you
need.
Monica  I heard that!
Ross  Well, I said it loud.
Margha  It is okay, if I stay and watch?
Chandler and Joey  Yeah! Why dont you stick around. You can sit right
there.
Chandler  Well, that went well.
Joey  I think so.
Chandler  Y'know, I was thinking about ah, asking her for her number.
Joey  Thanks man, but I think it makes a stronger statement if I ask for it
myself, y'know.
Chandler  Whoa-ho, whoa! No, I was thinking about y'know for me, as a part of
that whole getting over Janice thing you were talking about.
Joey  Oh, yeah, that. All right, means that much to ya, Ill let you have
her.
Chandler  Thanks. What, let me have her?! What do mean? Like if you didnt
I wouldnt have a shot?
Joey  Well I dont like to say it out loud, but, yeah! Dont feel bad
man, we all have our strengths. Youre better with numbers and stuff.
Chandler  Math!! Youre giving me math! All right, look y'know what, forget
about it, you go for the girl, well see who gets her.
Ross  Chandler, I want you to run a post pattern to the left, okay. And
sweetie..
Rachel  Yeah, I know, go long. Y'know, its like all Im doing is
running back and forth from the huddle.
Ross  Well ah, you wanna just stay out there?
Rachel  Can I see that for second.
Ross  Yeah.
Ross  Okay. Hut! Hike!
Joey  Fumble!
Joey  What the hells the matter with you?! This is my favourite jersey.
Chandler  Well now you have two. Hey, I am good at math.
Joey  All right, thats it. Y'know I was still gonna let you have her. But
now, forget about it. Prepare to feel very bad about yourself.
Chandler  Hey! Well, Ive been preparing for that my entire life! Or
something about you thats mean!
Monica  All right, come on guys, lets go! Tie score, and were
runnin out of time. Forty-two!! Thirty-eight!! Hike! (the timer sounds as Monica
throws the ball to Phoebe.)
Phoebe  Oh I got it!! (catches the ball) Oh! Ew! Broken boob! Ow!
Joey  Pheebs, run!
Monica  Run, Phoebe, run!
Phoebe  Touchdown!! Touchdown!!
Ross  Uh, hello, the buzzer buzzed. It doesnt count.
Monica  After the snap!
Ross  Before the snap!
Joey  After!!
Chandler  Before!!
Rachel  Now, does it really matter?
All  Yes!!
Phoebe  Well, okay, I made a touchdown. It was my first touchdown. So?
Ross  Oh Pheebs, thats great. It doesnt count.
Monica  Does so count!
Ross  Cheater, cheater, compulsive eater.
Phoebe  Oh my God!
Monica  Y'know what, thats fine, maybe you havent grown up, but I
have.
Ross  Oh-ho, okay.
Monica  Dead leg!! (kicks him in the thigh.)
Ross  Ow! Ow! Okay, okay, fine, fine! All right, you wanna win by cheating, go
ahead, all right. Phoebe the touchdown does count, you win.
Phoebe  Woo-yay!!
Monica  No! Listen, Im not gonna go through this with you again, okay.
Just once I wanna beat when you cant blame it on the broken nose, the buzzer, or the
fact that you thought you were getting mono. Lets just call this, tie score and
its halftime.
Ross  Okay, first of all, I dont play with cheaters, and second of all,
you know I had swollen glands!!
Monica  Y'know what? Ill think youll play.
Ross  Oh really! Why is that?
Monica  Because the winner gets this!
Ross  The Geller Cup.
Chandler  Is everybody else seeing a troll doll nailed to a two by four?
All  Yeah.
Chandler  Okay, good.
[Scene  The park, the gang is returning to play the second half of the game.]
Ross  Okay, where in the hell did you get that?!
Monica  When Mom and Dad drove you to the hospital to get your nose fixed, I
swam into the lake and fished it out.
Ross  That cup is mine!
Monica  No its not! You want it, youre gonna have to win it!
Rachel  All right, so are we not having dinner at all?
Monica  Come on Phoebe, lets go! Come on, its time to get serious,
huddle up. Joey, keep your head in the game.
Joey  Its hard, y'know, his huddle is closer to Dutch girl.
Monica  All right look, if I take Chandler out of the running will you be able
to focus?
Joey  What are you gonna do?
Monica  All right, you just make sure that Chandler catches the ball, Ill
take care of the rest.
Joey  Okay.
Monica  Break!
Joey  Here you go!
Ross  Chandler! Chandler!
Chandler  (to Margha) Hi.
Monica  Whoa! Whoa!! Tackled by a girl! Bet ya dont see that everyday, do
ya?
Ross  Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whats with the tackling?
Monica  What?! I just touched him and he went over.
Ross  Okay, you wanna play rough, we can play rough.
[Sequence 1  Monica throws the ball over Chandlers head to Joey who catches it
for a touchdown, and starts to dance in celebration. Chandler then tackles him, and he
starts to dance in celebration.]
[Sequence 2  Monica runs upfield and stops, waiting for a pass. Ross runs over and
pulls her pants down, steps in front of her and intercepts the pass.]
[Sequence 3  Chandler throws a pass to Ross, who catches it. Phoebe starts screaming
and runs up to him and tries to tackle him. But all she ends up doing is running around
his waist and screaming.]
[Sequence 4  Ross hikes the ball to Chandler, and the camera pans down to show Rachel
standing deep in the end zone, playing with her gum. Something hits her on the head and
she looks up to see where it came from.]
[Sequence 5  Monica hands the ball off to Phoebe, who runs up field and delivers a
fore-arm shiver to Chandler, knocking him over and scores the touchdown, and she yells...]
Phoebe  I love this game!!
Ross  Hey, whered you get that?
Rachel  I went really long.
Monica  Forty-two to twenty-one! Like the turkey, Ross is done!
Ross  Its no surprise that your winning, cause you got to pick
first, so you got the better team.
Monica  Youre so pathetic! Why cant you just accept it, were
winning because Im better than you.
Monica  Oh, what a great argument, exhaling! All right, y'know what, Ill
prove it to you, okay. Ill trade you Joey for Rachel, and Ill still win the
game.
Ross  What?! The guys against the girls? See, thats ridiculous Monica,
because Im only down by three touchdowns.
Monica  Oh, then bring it on! Oh, unless of course your afraid you might lose to
a bunch of girls.
Ross  Fine, fine, Rachel your with Monica, Joey youre with me.
Rachel  I can not believe your trading me!!
Monica  Come on Rach, come on. Lets see whats it like to be on a
winning team for a change.
Rachel  Are you gonna let me play?
Monica  All right then.
Margha  (coming over) The game is over, we eat now?
Chandler  No-no-no-no, the games not over, were just switching
teams.
Joey  Yeah, Chandler finds me so intimdating that its better if were
on the same team.
Ross  Right. Okay, lets play. Lets go.
Chandler  No ah, hold on a second Joe, where do Dutch people come from?
Joey  Ah well, the ah, Pennsylvania Dutch, come from Pennsylvania.
Chandler  And the other ah, Dutch people, they come on from somewhere near the
Netherlands, right?
Joey  Nice try. (to Margha) See the Netherlands is this make believe place where
Peter Pan and Tinker Bell come from.
Margha  Oh, my.
Ross  Enough with geography for the insane, okay? Lets play some ball,
guys.
Joey  Whoa, whoa, no, no, I-Im not playing with this guy, now.
Chandler  Fine with me.
Ross  Okay, y'know what, lets just cut to the chase here. Okay? Heidi,
which of my boys do you like?
Chandler and Joey  What are you doing? What are you doing? What are you doing?
Margha  Which do I like?
Ross  Yeah, y'know for dating, general merriment, taking back to your
windmill...
Margha  Well, if I had to chose right now, which by the way I find really weird,
I would have to say, Chandler.
Chandler  Yes!!
Joey  Wait a minute! Wait a minute! She obviously didnt understand the
question.
Chandler  Well, you dont you have Captain Hook explain it to her.
Margha  Im sorry, Joey, that is my chose.
Chandler  You hear that! That is her chose, mister Ill let you have her! I
win! You suck! I rule all! A mini-wave in celebration of me!! (does the wave.)
Margha  Im now thinking I would like to change my answer to, no one.
Chandler  Wh-what?
Margha  I now find you shallow and um, a dork. All right, bye.
Joey  Nice going. You just saved yourself a couple months of sex.
Chandler  Y'know what, it doesnt matter, cause she picked me. Me!
From now on I get the dates and you have to stay home on Saturday nights watching Ready,
Set, Cook!
Ross  Save the breakthroughs for therapy, okay. The clock is ticking. We have no
time, and we are losing, we are losing to girls.
Chandler  Were not gonna lose to girls.
Ross  Hey! Its 42-21!
Joey  This sucks, I was just up by that much!
Monica  Are we playing football or what? Come on you hairy-backed Marries.
Monica  We have to do this. We are playing for women everywhere. Okay, just
think about every lousy date that you ever had, okay, every guy who kept on the TV while
youre making out...
Phoebe  Oh my God! You dated someone with a glass eye too?!
Monica  Come on, okay, come on this is for all womankind. Lets kill
um!
Rachel  Yeah!!! Kill um!!!
Phoebe  All right, no, well I want to kill them to, but their boys, y'know how
are we gonna beat three boys?
[Sequence 1  Chandler is running past Phoebe with the ball, Phoebe flashes him, he
stops and stares dumbfounded at her. Phoebe then runs up and takes the ball away.]
[Sequence 2  Phoebe throws the ball, and its intercepted by Joey, who starts to
run up field. Rachel jumps on his back in order to try and tackle him, but she
doesnt slow him down. Monica and Phoebe then both grab her legs in order to stop
Joey, who still manages to fight through the tackle and score the touchdown.]
[Sequence 3  Chandler is running with the ball, Phoebe flashes him again, but Chandler
covers his eyes, and keeps running. He then runs into a tree at the end of the field.]
Monica  All right, we still have a minute and a half to go, and were down
by two points. Two points.... (she gets interrupted by the guys, who are doing a
slow-motion high five.) Phoebe you do a button-hook again. Rachel, you go long.
Rachel  No! Come on! Dont make me go long. Use me. They never cover me.
Monica  Honey, theres a reason.
Rachel  God, Im not lame, okay. I can do something. I can throw, would you
let me throw, come on this is my game too.
Phoebe  Come on Mon, let her throw the ball.
Monica  All right Rachel, you sweep behind, Ill pitch it to you, you throw
it down field to Phoebe. All right. Break.
Rachel  Thank you! Break!
Monica  Thirty-two! Seventy-one! Hike!
The Guys  One-Mississippi! Two-Mississippi! Three-Mississippi!
Rachel  Im so sorry! Are you okay?
Monica  No! Im not okay!
Rachel  Im sorry, they were just all coming at me, and I didnt know
what to do.
Joey  (looking at the timer) Thirty seconds left on the timer!
Chandler  Okay, okay, so we get to take that stupid troll thing home!
Monica  Come on! Come on! Hurry! Were running out of time! Huddle up!
Phoebe  Okay. Oooh! Oh, this is our last huddle, yeah.
Monica  All right, Phoebe get open. Rachel, go long.
Rachel  (on the verge of tears) Okay.
Monica  Break!
Rachel  (in triumph) I got a touchdown! We did it!!
Chandler  Hey-hey-hey Rachel, funny thing. Actually, the ah, end zone starts at
that pole, so youre five feet short, so we win!
Phoebe  Wait-wait-wait-wait! So, explain something to me though, if, if nobody
tagged Rachel, then isnt the play still going.
Ross  Let go! Let go!
Monica  Let go! Im a tiny little woman!!
Chandler  Guys! Guys! Come on! Its Thanksgiving, its not important
who wins or loses. The important thing is, (to Joey) the Dutch girl picked me! Me! Not
you! Holland loves Chandler! Thank you, Amsterdam! Good night!!
Monica  Ow!!
[Scene  Monica and Rachel's, Rachel, Phoebe, Chandler, and Joey are eating Thanksgiving
dinner.]
Rachel  We should defiantly play football more often. Maybe theres a like
league we could join or something.
Phoebe  Isnt there a national football league.
Chandler  Yes. Yes, there is, they play on Sundays and Monday nights.
Rachel  Oh shoot! I work Monday nights.
Phoebe  Umm, this stuffing is amazing. Do you think we should bring them some?
Joey  When theyre hungry enough, theyll come in.
[Scene  The park, its dark outside and Monica and Ross are still fighting over
the ball.]
Monica  Let go!
Ross  No! You let go!
Monica  No!
Ross  How come its always us left in the field holding the ball?
Monica  I dont know. I guess the other people just dont care enough.
Ross  Hey! Its starting to snow.
Ross  Gimme the this!
Monica  Let go!
[Scene  Central Perk, Chandler and Rachel are sitting on the couch.]
Chandler  (reading the comics) Eh..., I dont, I dont know.
Rachel  What?
Chandler  Well, as old as he is in dog years, do you think Snoopy should still
be allowed to fly this thing?
Gunther  Rachel?
Rachel  Yeah.
Gunther  Do you remember when you first came here, how you spent two weeks
getting trained by another waitress?
Rachel  Oh, sure! Do you need me to train somebody new?
Gunther  (laughs) Good one. Actually, ah, Terry wants you to take the training
again, whenever.
Rachel  (to Chandler) Eh, do you believe that?
Chandler  (thinks about it) Yeah?
[Scene  The hallway of Rosss building, there is a Brown Bird girl selling
cookies, as Ross and Chandler come up the stairs.]
Sarah  So thats two boxes of the Holiday Macaroons. On behalf of the Brown
Birds of America, I salute you. (Does the Brown Bird salute, she blows on a bird call,
then holds her hand, palm facing out, next to her face, and then waves it like a bird
flapping its wings.)
Ross  Just admit it Chandler, you have no backhand.
Chandler  Excuse me little one, I have a very solid backhand.
Ross  Shielding your face and shrieking like a girl... is not a backhand.
Chandler  I was shrieking... like a Marine.
Ross  All right here. Watch me execute the three Ps of championship
play. Power. (swings the racquet) Precision. (swings the racquet.) and penache. (does a
backswing and hits Sarah whos started up the stairs, knocking her down, they both
watch in horror.)
[Scene  Central Perk, the gangs all there discussing the incident.]
Monica  You broke a little girls leg?!!
Ross  I know. I feel horrible. Okay.
Chandler  (reading the paper) Says here that a muppet got whacked on Seasame
Street last night. (to Ross) Where exactly were around ten-ish?
Ross  Well, Im gonna go see her. I want to bring her something, what do
you think shell like?
Monica  Maybe a Hello Kitty doll, the ability to walk...
Rachel  Im gonna get back to retraining. (gets up)
Ross  All right, see you guys. (starts to leave)
Chandler  Look out kids, hes coming! (Ross continues to leave with his
head down in shame.)
Joey  And I gotta go sell some Christmas trees.
Phoebe  Have fun. Oh wait, no, dont! I forgot I am totally against that
now.
Joey  What? Me having a job?
Phoebe  No, no, I am against innocent trees being cut down in their prime, and
their, their corpses grotesquely dressed in like tinsel and twinkly lights. (to Joey) Hey,
how do you sleep at night?
Joey  Well, Im pretty tired from lugging the trees around all day. Hey,
Phoebe listen, you got this all wrong. Those trees were born to be Christmas trees, their
fulfilling their life purpose, by, by making people happy.
Phoebe  Really?
Chandler  Yes. Yes, and ah, ah, the trees are happy too, because for most of
them, its the only chance to see New York.
Gunther  ...and after youve delivered the drinks, you take the empty
tray....
Rachel  Gunther, Gunther, please, Ive worked here for two and a half
years, I know the empty trays go over there. (points to the counter.)
Gunther  What if you put them here. (sets the empty tray on another stack of
empty trays on the back counter.)
Rachel  Huh. Well, y'know thats actually a really good idea, because that
way theyll be closer to the mugs. Y'know what, you should have the other waitresses
do that too.
Gunther  They already do. Thats why they call it the tray
spot.
Rachel  Gee, I always heard them talk about that, I just always thought that it
was a club they went to. Oh God, Im, Im sorry. (walks away)
Gunther  Its all right. Sweetheart.
[Scene  Sarahs bedroom, her room is decorated with a space motif.]
Ross  So, this must be kinda neat for ya, huh? I mean, your Dad tells me that
you get a couple of days off school, and you, you ah, dont have to sell those
cookies anymore.
Sarah  Well, I kinda wanted to sell the cookies. The girl who sells the most
wins a trip to Spacecamp, and gets to sit in a real space shuttle.
Ross  Wow, you ah, you really like all this space stuff, huh?
Sarah  Yeah. My Dad says if I spend as much time helping him clean apartments,
as I do daydreaming about outer space, hed be able to afford a trip to the Taj
Mahal.
Ross  I think you would have to clean a whole lot of apartments to go all the
way to India.
Sarah  No. The one in Atlantic City, Dad loves the slots. He says hes
gonna double the college money my Grandma left me.
Ross  Huh. Well, good luck to Dad. Say, how many more boxes would you have to
sell in order to win?
Sarah  The girl who won last year sold four hundred and seventy-five.
Ross  Yeah.
Sarah  So far, Ive sold seventy-five.
Ross  Four hundred, huh? Well, that sounds do-able. (starts to get out his
wallet) How much are the boxes?
Sarah  Five dollars a box.
Ross  (puts away his wallet) And what is second prize?
Sarah  A ten speed bike. But, Id rather have something my Dad
couldnt sell.
Ross  Well, that makes sense.
Sarah  Could you do me one favor, if its not too much trouble?
Ross  Yeah, Sarah, anything.
Sarah  Could you pull open the curtains for me? The astronauts from the space
shuttle are gonna be on the news, and since we dont have a TV, the lady across the
alley said shed push hers up to a window, so I could watch it.
[Scene  A hallway, Ross is selling Brown Bird cookies for Sarah, he stops and knocks on
a door.]
Woman  (looking through her peephole, we see Ross standing in the hallway.)
Yesss?
Ross  Hi, Im selling Brown Bird cookies.
Woman  Youre no Brown Bird, I can see you through my peephole.
Ross  No, hi, Im, Im an honorary Brown Bird (does the Brown Bird
salute.)
Woman  What does that mean?
Ross  Ah, well, it means that I can sell cookies, but Im not invited to
sleep-overs.
Woman  I can dial 9-1-1 at the touch of a button, y'know. Now, go away!
Ross  No, please, please, um, its for a poor little girl who wants to go
to Spacecamp more than anything in the world.
Woman  Im pressing, a policeman is on his way.
Ross  Okay, okay! Im going. Im going. (goes across the hall to knock
on another door.)
Woman  I can still see you!
Ross  All right!!
[Scene  Joeys work, selling Christmas trees.]
Phoebe  (walking up to Joey) Hey.
Joey  Hey. What, what are you doing here?
Phoebe  Well, I-I thought a lot about what you said, and um, I realilized duh,
all right maybe I was a little judgmental. Yeah, (looks at the tree) oh, but oh...
Joey  Look now, Phoebe remember, hey, their just fulfilling their Christmas....
Phoebe  Destiny.
Joey  Sure.
Phoebe  Yes.
Joey  All right.
Phoebe  Okay. (One of Joeys co-workers, walks by with a dead tree.) Yikes!
That one doesnt look very fulfilled.
Joey  Oh, thats, thats ah, one of the old ones, hes just
taking it to the back.
Phoebe  You keep the old ones in the back, that is so ageist.
Joey  Well we have to make room for the fresh ones.
Phoebe  So, what happens to the old guys?
Joey  Well, they go into the chipper.
Phoebe  Why, do I have a feeling thats not as happy as it sounds? (Joey
points out one going into the chipper to her, as this haunty, demonic music starts to play
in the background) No! Nooooo!!! (she winces in horror and hides her face against
Joeys shoulder, as she sees the tree spit out from the chipper.)
Joey  (to the guy operating the chipper) Hey! Hey!! (makes the cut
it motion with his hands)
[Scene  Central Perk, all except Phoebe are there, Ross is telling the gang, minus
Rachel whos still being retrained, about the different cookie options.]
Ross  ...and these come in the shapes of your favourite Christmas characters,
Santa, Rudolph, and Baby Jesus.
Joey  All right, Ill take a box of the cream filled Jesuss.
Ross  Wait a minute, one box! Come on, Im trying to send a little girl to
Spacecamp, Im putting you down for five boxes. Chandler, what about you?
Chandler  Ahh, do you have any coconut flavoured deities?
Ross  No, but ah, theres coconut in the Hanukkah Menoreoes. I tell you
what, Ill put you down for eight boxes, one for each night.
Ross  Mon?
Monica  All right, Ill take one box of the mint treasures, just one, and
thats it. I-I started gaining weight after I joined the Brown Birds. (to Ross)
Remember, how Dad bought all my boxes and I ate them all?
Ross  Ah, no Mon, Dad had to buy everyone of your boxes because
you ate them all. But ah, y'know Im sure thats not gonna happen this time, why
dont I put you down for three of the mint treasures and just a couple of the
Rudolphs.
Monica  No.
Ross  Oh, come on, now you know you want em.
Monica  Dont, dont, dont, dont, dont do this.
Ross  Ill tell you what Mon, Ill give you the first box for free.
Monica  (she reaches out for it and stops) Oh God! I gotta go! (runs out)
Ross  Come on! All the cool kids are eating em! (chases after her.)
Gunther  And when you have a second later, I wanna show you why we dont
just trap spiders under coffee mugs and leave them there.
Rachel  (sitting down next to Chandler) Im training to be better at a job
that I hate, my life officially sucks.
Joey  Look Rach, wasnt this supposed to a temporary thing? I thought you
wanted to do fashion stuff?
Rachel  Well, yeah! Im still pursuing that.
Chandler  How... exactly are you pursuing that? Y'know other than sending out
resumes like what, two years ago?
Rachel  Well, Im also sending out.... good thoughts.
Joey  If you ask me, as long as you got this job, youve got nothing
pushing you to get another one. You need the fear.
Rachel  The fear?
Chandler  Hes right, if you quit this job, you then have motivation to go
after a job you really want.
Rachel  Well then how come youre still at a job that you hate, I mean why
dont you quit and get the fear?
Chandler  Because, Im too afraid.
Rachel  I dont know, I mean I would give anything to work for a designer,
y'know, or a buyer.... Oh, I just dont want to be 30 and still work here.
Chandler  Yeah, thatd be much worse than being 28, and still
working here.
Gunther  Rachel?
Rachel  Yeah.
Gunther  Remind me to review with you which pot is decaf and which is regular.
Rachel  Cant I just look at the handles on them?
Gunther  You would think.
Rachel  Okay, fine. Gunther, y'know what, I am a terrible waitress, do you know
why Im a terrible waitress? Because, I dont care. I dont care. I
dont care which pot is regular and which pot is decaf, I dont care where the
tray spot is, I just dont care, this is not what I want to do. So I dont think
I should do it anymore. Im gonna give you my weeks notice.
Gunther  What?!
Rachel  Gunther, I quit.
Chandler  (to Joey) Does this mean were gonna have to start paying for
coffee? (Joey shrugs his shoulders.)
[Scene  Monica and Rachel's, Chandler is entering numbers on a calculator as Ross reads
off how much hes sold.]
Ross  ....and 12, 22, 18, four... (Chandler starts laughing) What?
Chandler  I spelled out boobies.
Monica  (comes up and starts looking through Rosss cookie supply) Ross,
but me down for another box of the mint treasures, okay. Where, where are the mint
treasures?
Ross  Ah, were out. I sold them all.
Monica  What?
Ross  Monica, Im cutting you off.
Monica  No. No, just, just, just a couple more boxes. It-it-its no big
deal, all right, Im-Im cool. You gotta help me out with a couple more boxes!
Ross  Mon, look at yourself. You have cookie on your neck.
Monica  (covers her neck) Oh God! (runs to the bathroom)
Chandler  So, how many have you sold so far?
Ross  Check this out. Five hundred and seventeen boxes!
Chandler  Oh my God, how did you do that?
Rachel  (entering) Okay, stop what youre doing, I need envelope stuffers,
I need stamp lickers.....
Ross  Well hey, who did these resumes for ya?
Chandler  Me! On my computer.
Ross  Well you sure used a large font.
Chandler  Eh, yeah, well ah, waitress at a coffee shop and cheer squad
co-captain only took up so much room.
Rachel  Hey-hey-hey thats funny! Your funny Chandler! Your a funny guy!
You wanna know what else is really funny?!
Chandler  Something else I might have said?
Rachel  I dont know, I dont know, werent you the guy that told
me to quit my job when I had absolutely nothing else to do. Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha!!
Ross  Sweetie, calm down, its gonna be okay.
Rachel  No, its not gonna be okay Ross, tomorrow is my last day, and I
dont have a lead. Okay, y'know what, Im just gonna, Im just gonna call
Gunther and Im gonna tell him, Im not quitting.
Chandler  You-you-you dont wanna give into the fear.
Rachel  You and your stupid fear. I hate your fear. I would like to take you and
your fear....
Joey  (entering, interrupting Rachel) Hey! I got great news!
Chandler  Run, Joey! Run for your life! (runs out)
Joey  What? Rachel, listen, have you ever heard of Fortunata Fashions?
Rachel  No.
Joey  Well my old man is doing a plumbing job down there and he heard they have
an opening. So, you want me to see if I can get you an interview?
Rachel  Oh my God! Yes, I would love that, oh, that is soo sweet, Joey.
Joey  Not a problem.
Rachel  Thanks.
Joey  And now for the great news.
Ross  What, that wasnt the great news?
Joey  Only if you think its better than this... (holds up an aerosol can)
snow-in-a-can!! I got it at work. Mon, you want me to decorate the window, give it a kind
of Christmas lookie.
Monica  Christmas cookie?
[Scene  Joey work, Joey is showing a guy a tree.]
Joey  Okay, and ah, this one here is a Douglas Fir, now its a little more
money, but you get a nicer smell.
Guy  Looks good. Ill take it.
Phoebe  (running up carrying a tree) Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait! No, no, you
dont want that one. No, you can have this cool brown one. (points to the almost dead
tree she has)
Guy  Its-its-its almost dead!
Phoebe  Okay but thats why you have to buy it, so it can fulfil its
Christmas destiny, otherwise there gonna throw it into the chipper. Tell him, Joey
Joey  Yeah, the ah, trees that dont fulfil their Christmas destiny are
thrown in the chipper.
Guy  I-I think Im gonna look around a little bit more.
Joey  Pheebs, you gotta stop this, I working on commission here.
Monica  (entering) Hey, guys. Im here to pick out my Christmas tree.
Phoebe  Well look no further, (shows her the dead one) this ones yours!
Ahhh.
Monica  Is this the one that I threw out last year?
Phoebe  All right y'know what, nevermind! Everyone wants to have a green one!
Im sorry, Im sorry, I didnt mean to get so emotional, I guess its
just the holidays, its hard.
Monica  Oh honey, is that cause your Mom died around Christmas?
Phoebe  Oh, I wasnt even thinking about that.
Monica  Oh. (turns and looks at Joey, who gives a way-to-go thumbs
up and smile.)
[Scene  A Brown Bird meeting, Ross is there with the other Brown Birds to see who won
the contest.]
Ross  (to the girl sitting next to him) Hi there. How many, how many ah, did you
sell?
Girl  Im not gonna tell you! Youre the bad man who broke
Sarahs leg.
Ross  Hey now! That was an accident, okay.
Girl  Youre a big scrud.
Ross  Whats a scrud?
Girl  Why dont you look in the mirror, scrud.
Ross  I dont have too. I can just look at you.
Leader  All right girls, and man. Lets see your final tallies. (all the
girls raise their hands) Ohhhh, Debbie, (looks at her form) 321 boxes of cookies, (to
Debbie) Very nice.
Ross  (to himself) Not nice enough.
Leader  Charla, 278. Sorry, dear, but still good.
Ross  (to himself) Good for a scrud.
Leader  Oh, yes Elizabeth. Ah, 871.
Ross  Thats crap!! Sister Brown Bird. (to Elizabeth) Good going. (does the
salute)
Leader  Whos next? (goes over and stands behind Ross, whos
feverishly writing on his form, and clears her throat to get his attention.)
Ross  Hi there!
Leader  Hi. And batting for Sarah, Ross Geller, 872. Although, it looks like you
bought an awful lot of cookies yourself.
Ross  Um, that is because my doctor says that I have a very serious....
nuget.... diffency.
[Scene  Central Perk, Chandler, Phoebe, and Ross are there.]
Chandler  Tell us what happened, Brown Bird Ross.
Ross  Well, I lost. Some little girl loaned her uniform to her nineteen year old
sister, who went down to the U.S.S. Nimitz, and sold over 2,000 boxes.
Chandler  (to Rachel, whos entering) Hey! Howd the interview go?
Rachel  Oh, I blew it. I wouldnt of even hired me.
Ross  Oh, come here sweetie, listen, youre gonna go on like a thousand
interviews before you get a job. (she glares at him) Thats not how that was supposed
to come out.
Phoebe  This is the worst Christmas ever.
Chandler  Y'know what Rach, maybe you should just, y'know stay here at the
coffee house.
Rachel  I cant! Its too late! Terry already hired that girl over
there. (points to her) Look at her, shes even got waitress experience. Last night
she was teaching everybody how to make napkin.... (starts to cry) swans.
Ross  That word was swans.
[Scene  The hallway between the two apartments, Chandler, Phoebe, Ross, and Rachel are
coming up the stairs.]
Chandler  Well seeing that drunk Santa wet himself, really perked up my
Christmas.
Phoebe  Oh! Oh my God!
Joey and Monica  (jumping up from behind the couch) Merry Christmas!!
Phoebe  You saved them! You guys! Oh God, youre the best!
Chandler  Its like Night of the Living Dead Christmas Trees.
Rachel  (answering the phone) Hello? (listens) Yeah, this is she. (listens) Oh!
Youre kidding! Youre kidding! (listens) Oh thank you! I love you!
Chandler  Sure, everybody loves a kidder.
Rachel  (hanging up the phone) I got the job!
All  Thats great! Hey! Excellent!
Phoebe  Oh, God bless us, everyone.
[Scene  Central Perk, Rachel is serving her last cup of coffee.]
Rachel  Here we go. Im serving my last cup of coffee. (the gang starts
humming the graduation theme) There you go. (hands it to Chandler) Enjoy. (they all cheer)
Chandler  (to Ross) Should I tell her I ordered tea?
Ross  No.
Rachel  Um, excuse me, everyone. Ah, this is my last night working here, and I
ah, just wanted say that I made some really good friends working here, and ah, its
just time to move on. (at the counter Gunther starts to cry and runs into the back room)
Ah, and no offence to everybody who ah, still works here, you have no idea how good it
feels to say that as of this moment I will never have to make coffee again.
[Scene  Rachels new job, Rachels boss is telling her what to do.]
Rachels Boss  Now Mr. Kaplan Sr. likes his coffee strong, so your gonna
use two bags instead of one, see. Now pay attention, cause this parts tricky,
see some people use filters just once.
[Scene  The hallway between the apartments, Ross is bringing Sarah to Joey and
Chandlers.]
Ross  Im, Im sorry you didnt get to go to Spacecamp, and
Im hoping that maybe somehow, this may make up for it. Presenting Sarah
Tuttles Private Very Special Spacecamp!! (opens the door and Chandler and Joey jump
up, their apartment is decorated like outer space, one of the leather chairs is covered in
tinfoil.)
Sarah  Really Mr. Geller, you dont have to do this.
Ross  Oh come on! Here we go! (picks her up and puts her in the chair) Stand by
for mission countdown!
Joey  (simulating an echo) Ten, ten.., nine, nine, nine....,
eight, eight, eight... (Chandler hits him in the back of the head) Okay, Blast off!
Chandler  Im an alien. Im an alien.
Ross  Oh no! An asteroid! (throws the soccer ball off the back of Joeys
head.)
[Scene  Monica and Rachel's, Monica, Phoebe, Ross, Joey, and Rachel are
there, Joey is demonstrating a card trick.]
Joey  Okay, pick a card, any card. (Monica picks one) All right, now memorize
it. Show to everybody. Got it?
Monica  Um-mm.
Joey  All right, give it back to me. (takes the card back, but he looks at the
card before he puts it back in the deck, he holds the deck to his forehead, and thinks a
little while) 5 of hearts.
Ross  Real magic does exist.
Rachel  Wow.
Monica  Wow. Joey, (sarcastically) how do you do it?
Joey  I cant tell you that, no.
Ross  Ah, somebodys at the door on the ceiling.
Rachel  Noo, thats our unbelievably loud upstairs neighbor.
Monica  He took up the carpet, and now you can hear everything.
Phoebe  Why dont you go up there and ask him to step lightly,
please?
Monica  I have like five times, but the guy is so charming, that I go up there
to yell and then I end up apologizing to him.
Phoebe  Ooh, that is silly. (gets up) Ill go up there, Ill tell him
to keep it down.
Monica  All right, be my guest.
Rachel  Good luck.
Joey  All right, all right, all right, all right, all right, you really wanna
know how I did it, Ill show ya. When you handed me back the card, what you
didnt see was, I looked at it so fast that it was invisible to the naked eye. (picks
up a card and quickly looks at it) I just did it. (does it again) I just did it, again.
Here, Ill slow it down so that you guys can see it. (looks and the card in slow
motion)
All  Oh, I got it.
Phoebe  (muffled through the floor) Yeah, look I was with my friend downstairs
and we hear everything up here that you do, and I am sick and tired... (I tired but the
rest is unintelligible).
Guy  (muffled) Whoa, you are very beautiful.
Phoebe  (muffled) Oh, thank you.
[Scene  Monica and Rachel's, continued from earlier.]
Chandler  (entering) Hey, anybody got a length of rope about six feet long with
a little nouse at the end?
Monica  Honey, whats the matter?
Chandler  I just saw Janice.
All  Oh.
Chandler  Yeah, she was at Rockefeller Center skating with her husband, she
looked so happy. I almost feel bad for whipping that kids pretzel at them.
Joey  Man, I remember the first time I saw that girl Katherine, after we broke
up. She was just walking with her friend Donna, just laughing and talking. God, it killed
me.
Chandler  Yes, but you ended up having sex with both of them that afternoon.
Joey  Sorry, I just, any excuse to tell that story y'know....
Ross  Hey Chandler, theres a party tomorrow, youll feel better then.
Chandler  Oh, y'know what, Im gonna be okay, you dont have to throw
a party for me.
Monica  Its Joeys birthday.
Chandler  Oh, well then, if anybody should have a party it should be him.
Monica  Sush!! I cannot believe she is still up there.
Chandler  Okay, well he totally screwed up the punch line. Y'know, its
supposed to be arrghh-eh og-errigh.
[Scene  Fortunata Fashions, Rachels new job.]
Mr. Kaplan  (entering) Hows that coffee comin, dear?
Rachel  (jumping up from reading her magazine) Yeah, right away Mr. Kaplan.
Mr. Kaplan  Im not supposed to drink coffee, it makes me gassy.
Rachel  I know!
Mr. Kaplan  Ill bet your thinking, Whats an intelligent girl
who wants to be in fashion, doing making coffee? Eh?
Rachel  Op.
Mr. Kaplan  Eh.
Rachel  Oh, you got me.
Mr. Kaplan  Well, dont think I havent noticed your potential. Well,
Ive got a project for you thats a lot more related to fashion. How does that
sound?
Rachel  Oh, that sounds great.
Mr. Kaplan  Come on over here, sweetheart. (they walk over to a storage closet)
Rachel  Oh thank you so much Mr. Kaplan, thank you so much.
Mr. Kaplan  (opening the closet door revealing that its full of tangled up
hangers.) I need these hangers separated ASAP. (she is stunned) Youre welcome.
[Scene  The Moondance Diner, Rachel is talking to Monica about her job.]
Rachel  Oh God, I hate my job, I hate it, I hate my job, I hate it.
Monica  I know honey, Im sorry.
Rachel  Oh, I wanna quit, but then I think I should stick it out, then I think
why would such a person stay in such a demeaning job, just because its remotely
related to the field theyre interested in.
Monica  (gives her a look) Gee, I dont know Rach. Order up!! I got a
Yentel soup, a James Beans, and a Howdy hold the Dowdy!
Rachel  Oh honey, come on, Im sorry, I didnt.... I dont mind
paying my dues, y'know, its just how much am I gonna learn about fashion by walking Mira,
the arthritic seamstress, to the bathroom.
Rachel  (to him) Hi! Is my misery amusing to you?
Guy  Im sorry, I wa, I wa, I was just ah.... (starts to laugh again)
Rachel  Its not funny, this is actually my job.
Guy  Oh believe me, I-I-Ive been there. I had to sort mannequin heads at
that Mannequins Plus.
Rachel  Oh well then, so Im just going to go back to talking to my friend
here. And you can go back to enjoying your little hamburger.
Guy  Ah, just one other thing.
Rachel  Yes?!
Guy  I ah, I work at Bloomingdales and I might know of a job
possibility if your, if your interested?
Rachel  (looks at Monica) (to him) Do you want my pickle?
[Scene  Chandler and Joey's, its Joeys party.]
Gunther  (to Monica and Phoebe) Hey guys.
Monica  Hey Gunther. Hi. (to Phoebe) I mean youre going out on a date with
the noisy guy upstairs?
Phoebe  Well, hes very charming.
Monica  I know, hes too charming, but if you two start going out, then
its just gonna make it so much harder for me to hate him.
Phoebe  Well, youre just gonna have to try.
Monica  Joey, where are the Jell-o shots?
Joey  I dont know, Chandler is supposed to be passin em
around...
Joey  Chandler!
Chandler  Hello-dillillio!!
Ross  Oh, somebodys feeling better.
Monica  (to Chandler) Stick out your tongue.
Chandler  (to Monica) Take off your shirt!
Monica  Oh my!!
Joey  Oh my God! How many of these things did you have? These are pure vodka.
Chandler  Yeah, Jell-o just like Mom used to make.
Rachel  (entering, to Ross) The most unbelievable thing happened to me today.
Ross  Hi!
Rachel  Hi! So Im out having lunch at Monicas and this guy starts
talking to me, and it turns out he works for a buyer at Bloomingdales and
there happens to be an opening in his department. So I gave him my phone number and
hes gonna call me this weekend to see if he can get me an interview!
Ross  Wow!
Rachel  I know!
Ross  What, so this guy is helping you for no apparent reason?
Rachel  Uh-huh!
Ross  And hes, hes a total stranger?
Rachel  Yeah! His name is um, Mark something.
Ross  Huh. Sounds like Mark Something wants to have some sex.
Rachel  What!?
Ross  Well, Im just saying, I mean why else would he just, y'know, swoop
in out of nowhere for no reason.
Rachel  To be nice.
Ross  Hey, Joey. Are men ever nice to strange women for no reason?
Joey  No, only for sex.
Ross  Thank you. (to Rachel) So did you ah, did you tell Mark Something about
me?
Rachel  I didnt have to, because I was wearing my I heart Ross
sandwich board and ringing my bell.
Ross  Uh-huh.
Joeys Sisters  (entering) Joey!!! Happy Birthday!! (all 7 of them look
almost identical)
Joey  Hey!! Hey-hey-hey!
Chandler  (to Monica) Okay, how many of that girl are you seeing?
Monica  How hammered are you? Huh? These, these are Joeys sisters.
Chandler  Hi Joeys sisters!
Phoebe  (to one of his sisters, Cookie) Hey!
Cookie  Hey. What are we drinkin over here.
Phoebe  Well, I have ah, vodka and cranberry juice.
Cookie  No kiddin, thats the exact same drink I made myself right
after I shot my husband.
Phoebe  Wow. Okay, I dont know how to talk to you.
Sister 1  (to Chandler) What cha doing?
Chandler  Oh, Im taking my ex-girlfriend of my speed dialer.
Joeys Sisters  Oh!!
Chandler  No-no-no-no, no, its a good thing. Why must we dial so speedily
anyway? Why must we rush through life? Why cant we savor the precious moments? (to
one of Joeys sisters) Those are some huge breasts you have.
Ross  Hi.
Monica  Hi.
Ross  Yeah. So um, I-I heard about this ah, Mark guy that ah, Rachel met today.
Monica  Isnt that great?
Ross  Oh yeah! So ah, kinda pretty, pretty good. He sounds like a nice, good
guy.
Monica  Oh, he is. And he is so dreamy. I mean, y'know what, when he left I
actually used the phrase, Hummina-hummina-hummina. (walks away)
Ross  Thats excellent.
[Scene  Monica and Rachel's, Monica, Phoebe, Ross, and Rachel are eating breakfast.]
Ross  (to Rachel) So, hes just a nice guy. You really think this Mark
doesnt want anything in exchange for helping him?
Rachel  Well, I assume Ill have to take showers with him, but y'know,
thats true of any job.
Monica  How ya feelin?
Chandler  Well, my apartment isnt there anymore, because I drank it.
Phoebe  Whered you get too? We lost you after you opened up all the
presents.
Ross  Yeah.
Chandler  Yeah, I ended up in the storage room, and not alone.
All  Woooo hoooo!!!
Chandler  Ow, no woo-hooing, no woo-hooing.
Phoebe  Why, what happened?
Chandler  Ah, I fooled around with Joeys sister. (Phoebe gasps) Well,
thats not the worst part.
Monica  What is the worse part?
Chandler  I cant remember which sister.
Ross  (to Rachel) You see what men do! Dont tell me men are not nice!
(points to Chandler) This is men!!
[Scene  Monica and Rachel's, continued from earlier.]
Monica  Are you insane? I mean Joey, is going to kill you, hes actually
going to kill you dead.
Chandler  Okay! You dont think I thought of that?
Phoebe  How can you not know which one?
Rachel  I mean thats unbelievable.
Monica  I mean, was it Gina?
Ross  Which one is Gina?
Rachel  Dark, big hair, with the airplane earrings.
Monica  No, no, no, thats Dina.
Chandler  (to Monica) You see you cant tell which one is which either,
dwha!!
Phoebe  We didnt fool around with any of them. Dwha! Dwha!
Chandler  Veronica. Look, its got to be Veronica, the girl in the red
skirt. I definitely stuck my tongue down her throat.
Monica  That was me.
Chandler  Look, when Ive been drinking, sometimes I tend to get overly
friendly, and Im sorry.
Monica  Thats okay.
Rachel  Thats all right.
Ross  Thats okay.
Joey  (angrily entering, to Chandler) Can I talk to you for a second?!
Ross  Hey, Joey.
Rachel  Hey. (they all walk away from Chandler)
Joey  Come on!! (motions for Chandler to come with him)
Chandler  Why cant we talk in here? With, with, witnesses.
Joey  I just got off the phone with my sister.
Ross  Ah, which, which one?
Joey  Mary-Angela.
Ross  Mary-Angela.
Joey  Yeah.
Monica  Y'know which one was she again?
Joey  Why dont you ask Chandler, cause hes the one that fooled
around with her. She told me you said you could really fall for her. Now is that
true? Or are you just gettin over Janice by groping my sister.
Chandler  Its gotta be the first one.
Joey  Really? Thats great! You and my sister, sittin in a tree.
Chandler  Yep, Im in a tree.
[Scene  Monica and Rachel's, Monica is writing letters as Rachel enters.]
Rachel  Did he call? Did Mark call?
Monica  No honey, Im sorry, but the weekends not over yet.
Rachel  Oh. (we hear laughing from the upstairs apartment) Oh my God, is that
Phoebe?
Monica  I guess theyre back from their date.
Rachel  Music. Very nice.
Monica  Oh my God!
Rachel  So, how are you?
Monica  I am good. I finished my book.
Rachel  Oh yeah, whats it about?
Monica  I dont remember. Do you wanna take a walk?
Rachel  Yeah, I do. (they both run out)
[Scene  Chandler and Joey's, Ross is reading a letter that Chandler wrote.]
Ross  Dear Mary-Angela. Hi. Hows it going. This is the hardest letter
Ive ever had to write. (to Chandler) What the hells a matter with you? How do
you think Joeys going to react when he finds out that you blew off his sister with a
letter?
Chandler  Well, thats the part where you tell him that I moved to France.
When actually Ill be in Cuba.
Ross  All right, look, look, youve got to do this yourself, okay in
person. At least you know her name. You just go to the house and you ask for Mary-Angela,
okay, when which ever one she is comes to the door, you take her for a walk, you let her
down easy.
Chandler  What if Mary-Angela comes to the door and I ask for Mary-Angela?
Ross  Where in Cuba?
[Scene  Joeys sisters house, Chandler hits himself on the head three times
and knocks on the door three times. Joey answers it.]
Chandler  (shocked) Joey, what-wh-wh-wha-wh-wha-wh-wha-wh-wha-what are you doing
here?
Joey  Waiting for my Grandma to finish my laundry. What about you?
Chandler  Im here to see Mary-Angela.
Joey  You are so the man! (motions him to come in, and he does) Now look,
listen, listen, you got to be cool, cause my Grandma doesnt know about you two
yet, and you do not want to tick her off. She was like the sixth person to spit on
Mussolini's hanging body. Yeah.
Chandler  Wheres Mary-Angela?
Joey  Shes right in there. (motions to the living room)
Joeys Sisters  Hey, Chandler!
[Scene  Central Perk, Monica, Ross, and Rachel are there.]
Rachel  I cant believe Mark didnt call. Its Sunday night, and
he didnt call.
Ross  Bummer.
Rachel  (to Ross) Yeah, right. Look at you, youre practically giddy.
Ross  No, Im genuinely sorry the Mark thing didnt work out. Look,
Rach, I want only good things for you.
Monica  Wait a minute, why dont you just call Mark. (they both look up in
shock) I mean, who says you have to sit here and wait for him, youve got to make
stuff happen.
Ross  But, you, you dont want to seem too pushy.
Monica  (to Ross) Honey, its not pushy, he gave her his home number.
Ross  (to Rachel, as she gets his number) What, he gave you his home number? As
in like, to, to his home?
Rachel  Yeah, and you dont mind if I call, because you only want good
things for me.
Ross  Thats right good things, that-that is what I said. (glances at
Monica)
Rachel  (on phone) Hello, Mark? Hi, its Rachel Green. (listens) Oh no,
dont you apologize. (listens) Yeah, Ill hold. (to Monica and Ross) He left my
number at work, but he was helping his niece with her report on the pioneers.
Ross  That is so made up!
Rachel  (on phone) Yeah, oh my God, tomorrow! That, no, its perfect. Oh
God, thank you soo much. Great! Bye! (hangs up phone) I got the interview!
Monica  Yay!
Ross  There you go.
Rachel  He even offered to meet me for lunch tomorrow to prep me for it.
Monica  Oh, that is amazing!
Ross  Yeah well, if I know Mark, and I think I do, Id expect nothing less.
Rachel  I got to figure out what Im going to wear.
Ross  High collar and baggy pants say Im a pro.
Rachel  Yeah! Right! Okay, Ill see you guys later. (starts to leave) Woo
hoo!
Ross  You go get em. (to Monica) What did I do to you? Did I hurt you in
some way?
Monica  What?
Ross  Why dont you call him?! Well, thank you very much!
Y'know now he is going to prep her, y'know prep her, as in what you do when you surgically
remove the boyfriend!
Monica  Are you crazy?!
Ross  Am I! Am I! Am I out of my mind! Am I losing my senses!! This dreamy guy
is taking my girlfriend out for a meal.
Monica  What?! Ross y'know this isnt even about you! I mean this is about
Rachel and something wonderful happening for her. I mean you know even if youre
right, what if he wants to sleep with her, does it mean he gets too?
Ross  No.
Monica  I mean dont you trust her?
Ross  Well, yeah!
Monica  Then get over yourself! Grow up!
Ross  (shyly) You grow up.
[Scene  Joeys sisters house, theyre finishing up dinner.]
Chandler  This teramisu is, is excellent. Did you make it Mary-Angela?
Joeys Grandmother  No! I did!
Chandler  Well, its, its yummy. So Mary-Angela do you like it?
Joeys Grandmother  Of course! Its her favorite.
Chandler  So um, Mary-Angela, whats your second favorite?
Joeys Grandmother  More of Grandmas teramisu.
Chandler  Would you just please....give me the receipt cause this is
great. Its top notch.
Joeys Grandmother  That dies with me.
Chandler  So will I.
Joeys Sister  Excuse yourself, and go to the bathroom.
Chandler  Oh no-no-no I was just squinting. That doesnt mean anything.
Joeys Sister  (whispering in his ear) Just do it.
Chandler  Will you excuse me I have to um..... (walks to the hall)
Chandler  (startled) Hey!
Joeys Sister  Finally, I thought wed never be alone. Can I just tell
you something, I have not stopped thinking about you since the party. (kisses him)
Chandler  Look, I may have jumped the gun here. (she tries to kiss him, but he
ducks it and moves away) Um, I just got out of a relationship and Im not really in
a, in a commitment kind of place.
Joeys Sister  So! Me neither! God, Mary-Angela was right you do have the
softest lips.
Chandler  Ahhhh, youre not Mary-Angela.
Joeys Sister  No, Im Mary-Theresa.
Chandler  This is so bad. If-if youre not Mary-Angela, then-then who is?
Mary-Angela  (standing behind Chandler) I am!
Chandler  Oh, this is soo bad. (doesnt see Mary-Angela)
Mary-Angela  Joey!!!
Chandler  No Joey! No Joey! Dont Joey! Joey!
Joey  Whats goin on?
Chandler  (pats him on the shoulder) Youre it! Now run and hide!
Mary-Theresa  Its no big deal. Chandler was just kissin me because
he thought I was Mary-Angela.
Joey  What?! How could you do that, how could you think she was Mary-Angela?
Chandler  I wasnt sure which one Mary-Angela was. (all of Joeys
sisters gasp) Look, Im sorry okay, I was really drunk, and you all look really
similar.
Joeys Sister  I say, punch him Joey.
All  Yeah! Punch him!!
Chandler  Y'know what, we should all calm down because your brothers not
going to punch me. (to Joey) Are ya?
Joey  Well, that is usually what I would do. But I just never thought youd
be on the receiving end of it. How could you do this?!
Chandler  Joey if you wanna punch me, go ahead, I deserve it. But I just want
you to know that I would never soberly hurt you or your family, youre my best
friend. I would never do anything like this ever again.
Cookie  So what. I say, punch him.
All  Yeah! Punch him! Punch him!
Joey  No! No! No! No, Im not going to punch Chandler.
Cookie  Ill do it.
Joey  No you wont. Look he knows he did a terrible thing and I believe
him, hes sorry. But, (to Chandler) youve got one more apology to make, all
right, youve got to apologize to Mary-Angela.
Chandler  Okay, absolutely!
Joey  All right.
Chandler  Youve got it. (he starts to look at his sisters, but he
still doesnt know which one is Mary-Angela.)
Joey  Cookie, now you can punch him!
Chandler  What?! (Cookie punches him)
[Scene  A lobby, Ross is waiting for Rachel, after her interview.]
Rachel  (getting of the elevator and noticing Ross) Hey!
Ross  Hi!
Rachel  What are you doing here?
Ross  Ah y'know, this building is on my paper route so I... (gives her a flower)
Rachel  Oh.
Ross  Hi. (kisses her)
Rachel  Hi.
Ross  Howd did it go?
Rachel  Oh well, the woman I interviewed with was pretty tough, but y'know thank
God Mark coached me, because once I started talking about the fall line, she got all happy
and wouldnt shut up.
Ross  Im so proud of you.
Rachel  Me too!
Ross  Listen, Im ah, Im sorry Ive been so crazy and jealous
and, its just that I like you a lot, so...
Rachel  I know.
Ross  Yeah.
Rachel  Yeah.
Mark  Rachel?
Rachel  Yeah. (turns around) Hi Mark!
Mark  Hi. I just talked to Joanna, and she loves you. You got it, you got the
job.
Rachel  Oh, I did!
Mark  Yes.
Rachel  (to Ross) Oh my God!! (she turns around and hugs Mark, not Ross)
Ross  Congratu!! (sees her hug Mark) -lations-lations.
[Scene  Monica and Rachel's, The entire gang is there.]
Monica  So ah, Phoebe, how was your date?
Phoebe  Oh well y'know. (laughs)
Monica  Yeah, I do know.
Phoebe  Ick, you were eavesdropping.
Rachel  Eavesdropping. Pheebs, the ceiling tiles were falling down.
Phoebe  Oh, Im sorry. But I really like this guy. And I think he really
happens to like me.
Ross  Maybe hes just jumping on a pogo-stick and really likes it?
Ross  Maybe the pogo-stick likes it too?
Joey  All right, thats it! He cannot do this to Phoebe. (gets up) This guy
is going to get the butt kicking of a lifetime! (stops and turns around and asks Rachel)
But, is he a big guy?
Ross  Ah, well all go. (motions to Chandler) Come on. (the guys leave)
Phoebe  Thanks you guys! Thank you.
Chandler  Dont worry.
Phoebe  God, I hope they kick his ass!
Rachel  Honey, Im sorry.
Monica  Y'know if its any consolation, he really did sound like he was
having more fun with you. (Rachel nods in agreement)
Guy  (muffled) May I help you?
[Scene  Monica and Rachel's, Rachel is getting ready for her first day.]
Rachel  (running in from her bedroom, wearing only a towel) Okay. Hey. Umm. Does
everybody hate these shoes?
Chandler  Oh yeah, but don't worry. I don't think anybody's gonna focus on that
as long as your wearing that towel dress.
Rachel  (to Ross) Tell him.
Ross  (to Chandler) It's her first day at this new job. Your not supposed to
start with her!
Chandler  All right, I suppose I can wait a day. Hey, what are you doing Friday?
Ross  Why?
Chandler  I need you to come to this bachelor party for my weird cousin Albert,
y'know he's the botanist.
Ross  Oh God. Y'know, botanists are such geeks.
Chandler  Yeah. Is that a dinosaur tie?
Ross  Hmm? Oh, yeah. (he makes a growling sound)
Phoebe  (entering, with about 20 purses hanging around her neck) Morning. Rach,
I'm here with the purses!
Chandler  (to Phoebe) It must take you forever to find your keys.
Rachel  (running into the living room) Thank you, thank you, thank you, Pheebs.
Phoebe  Your welcome, oh please not the one with the turtles.
Rachel  No, no, no, no turtles scare me. I don't need that today.
Ross  Honey, just relax, it's gonna be fine. Hey, umm,. why don't I come down
there and I'll take you out to lunch?
Rachel  Oh honey, thank you, but Mark's taking me out.
Ross  Mark is that ah, the same Mark that helped you get the job?
Rachel  Yeah, it's kinda like a 'good luck on your first day' sort of thing. (to
Phoebe) Is this actually a lunchbox?
Phoebe  Umm, no, it's a purse. And there's a thermos in it.
Rachel  Oh.
Chandler  (to Ross) Hey, so can you make it on Friday?
Ross  What? Oh yeah, yeah I think so. Why am I invited to this again?
Chandler  Well apparently Albert has no friends. He's very excited about the
bachelor party though. I think actually the only reason he's getting married is so he can
see a stripper.
Phoebe  A stripper at a bachelor party, that is so cliché. Why don't you get a
magician?!
Chandler  Well, if the magician can open my beer with his but cheeks, then all
right.
[Scene  Chandler and Joey's, Ross and Chandler are entering, Joey is on the phone.]
Ross  She's having lunch with him. She's having lunch with him. And you should
of seen the hug she gave him when she got the job. And, and, and, (to Joey) he's really
good looking. (Joey gives an enthusiastic thumbs up) What am I gonna do?
Chandler  Don't do anything. Keep it inside. Learn how to hide your feelings!
(pause) Don't cry outloud.
Joey  (hanging up the phone) Yes! Guess who's in an audition for a Broadway
musical?
Chandler  I want to say you but, that seems like such an easy answer.
Joey  It is me! It's a musical version of Tale of Two Cities. So I think
I'm gonna sing New York, New York, and ah, oh I left My Heart in San Francisco.
Ross  Ah Joey, I don't think you get to pick the cities.
Joey  What?
Ross  Mr. Dickens gets to pick 'em.
Joey  Who?
Chandler  I'll get you the Cliff Notes.
Joey  The what?
Chandler  The abridgment.
Joey  Oh, okay. (to Ross) The what?
[Scene  Rachel's office, Mark is training Rachel.]
Mark  ...and the style number, and the invoice number, and the shipping date.
Good. Any questions so far?
Rachel  Yeah. What kind of discount do we get?
Mark  Twenty percent.
Rachel  Oh!! I love this job! (her phone rings) Wow! My first call.
Mark  Here, let me. (answers phone) Rachel Green's line, how may I help you?
Ross  (on phone) Hi, is Rachel there?
Mark  And who may I say is calling?
Ross  This is Ross?
Mark  Ross of.....
Ross  Of Ross and Rachel.
Mark  Oh hi. It's, it's Mark.
Ross  Oh hey, hey Mark.
Mark  Hey, hold on a second.
Ross  Okay.
Rachel  Hi honey!
Ross  Hi! What's ah, what's Mark doing answering your phone?
Rachel  Oh, he's just goofing around.
Ross  Ohhhhh yeah, that's, that's funny. Why ah, why isn't he goofing around in
his own office?
Rachel  Oh honey, this is his office too. I told you we're Joanna's two
assistants.
Ross  Why does Joanna need two assistants, how, how lazy is she?
Rachel  Oh! Oh my God! What did I just do?
Ross  What?
Rachel  I think I just shipped 3,000 bras to personnel. Oh honey, I gotta go.
(to Mark) Mark, I need you!
Ross  Okay, bye-bye. (starts slamming the receiver down in anger.)
Rachel  Ow! Ross!!
Ross  Oh, oh, I'm, I'm, I'm sorry sweetie, I was just trying to ah, I'm dialing
another number. (hangs up)
[Scene  The Moondance diner, Monica is cleaning up with one of the waiters, with her
back turned to him she removes her fake breasts and hides them under her wig.]
Jeannine  (to Monica) All right, I just got changed in thirty seconds so you can
be alone with him. You'd better go for it.
Monica  Please, I'm not going for anything.
Jeannine  Well, if you don't, I will.
Monica  Would you please go?
Jeannine  Night Mon. Night Julio.
Julio  (to Jeannine) Adios.
Monica  Look Julio, someone left their book here.
Julio  Ah actually, that is mine.
Monica  Oh yeah, what are you reading?
Julio  Flowers of Evil, by Beaudalire. Have you read it?
Monica  Have I read it? (pause) No, are you enjoying it?
Julio  I thought I would, but the translation's no good.
Monica  Your a poet and don't know it. (she turns away and makes a face like 'I
can't believe I just said that.')
Julio  Actually I ah, I am a poet.
Monica  Oh, then you do know it. (pause) So um what kind of things do you write
about?
Julio  Things that move me. The, the shadow of a tree, a child laughing, or this
lip. (points to her lip)
Monica  Mine? (points to her lower lip) Right here?
Julio  I can write an epic poem about this lip. (grabs her lower lip)
Monica  How would that go? (they kiss) Well, it didn't rhyme, but I liked it.
[Scene  Joey's audition.]
Joey  (singing) You've got to pick a pocket or two. Boyyyyssss, (picks a
handkerchief from the pianist's pocket) you've got to pick a pocket or two..........
Director  Lovely, just lovely.
Joey  Really? Thanks.
Director  Listen Joey, we definitely want to see you for the callback on
Saturday.
Joey  Excellent, I'll be there.
Director  Okay, and listen don't forget to bring your jazz shoes for the dance
audition.
Joey  Ahhh! My ah, my agent said it wasn't a dancing part.
Director  Joey, all the roles got to dance a little. But believe me with your
dance background it'll be a piece of cake.
[Scene  Chandler and Joey's, Chandler is reading Joey's resume.]
Chandler  ....three years of modern dance with Twila Tharp! Five years with the
American Ballet Theater?!
Joey  Hey, everybody lies on their resume, okay. I wasn't one of the Zoom Kids
either.
Phoebe  Well, can you dance at all?
Joey  Yeah, I can dance, y'know. (starts to dance really, really, really badly)
Chandler  Oh no, no, no, no.
Phoebe  (covering her mouth in shock) What, what is that?
Joey  Sure, it looks stupid now, there's no music playing.
Chandler  All right, I have to get that, but no-no. (answering phone) Hello?
(listens) (happily) Hi! Yeah listen, I'm, I'm in need of a stripper and I was told that
you do that. (listens) Let me ask you this, what, what do you do for the extra hundred?
(listens) So would I, would I have to provide the grapes?
Monica  (entering) Hi!
Phoebe  Oh, how was last night with Julio, senorita?
Monica  It was soo amazing, he is so sexy, and smart, which makes him even
sexier. Oh gosh, I gotta so you this. Last night, we were fooling around and he stops to
write a poem.
Joey  Get out! I couldn't stop if a meteor hit me.
Chandler  Okay, we have our stripper. A miss Crystal Chandelier.
Joey  Well sure, you name a kid that, what do you expect them to grow up to be?
Monica  Anyway um, when he left he forgot to take the poem with him. Now, I am
like totally dense about poetry, but I think it's pretty good all right. Check it out.
(hands them the poem)
Joey  (reading) The Empty Vase. Translucent beauty...
Chandler  To yourself. (finishing) Hey-hey-hey, y'know what that's pretty good.
Monica  Oh good, I think so too. Pheebs?
Phoebe  Oh yeah.
Monica  Oh, I'm so glad you guys like it. Yay! All right I gotta go to work.
(tries to take the poem)
Joey  Whoa, I'm not done.
Monica  All right, just give it back to me when your done. See you guys.
Chandler  Bye-bye.
Phoebe  Oh my God, oh my God! Poor Monica!
Chandler  What, what, what?!
Phoebe  What?! He was with her when he wrote this poem. Look, (reading) 'My
vessel so empty with nothing inside. Now that I've touched you, you seem emptier still.'
He thinks Monica is empty, she is the empty vase!
Chandler  You really think that is what he meant?
Phoebe  Oh, totally. Oh, God, oh, she seemed so happy too.
Joey  Done.
[Scene  Rachel's office, her desk is covered with stuff Ross has sent her.]
Mark  (reaching through the flowers) Do you have the, the Ralph Lauren file?
Rachel  Oh, yeah, sure, it's umm... (she picks up this bug and it starts to play
the theme from Love Story)
Mark  Wh-what's that?
Ross  It's from Ross, it's a love bug.
Mark  Wow! Somebody wants people to know you have a boyfriend.
Rachel  Oh no, no-no-no, that's not, not, not, what he is doing. He's just, he's
just really romantic.
Man  (to Rachel) Ah, excuse me, are you Rachel Green?
Rachel  Yes.
Man  (being joined by the rest of the barbershop quartet) One, two, three...
Quartet  (singing) Congratulations on your first week at your brand new job! It
won't be long before your the boss.
The Bass Barber  Omm-pah, omm-pah, omm-pah.
Quartet  (singing) And you know who will be there to support... you?! Your one
and only boyfriend...
The Bass Barber  It's nice to have a boyfriend.
Quartet  Your loyal loving boyfriend Ross..... Ross!
[Scene  Monica and Rachel's, Ross and Rachel are entering the living room from her
bedroom.]
Ross  I'm hurt! I'm actually hurt, that you would think that I would send you
any of those things out of any thing other than love. Hurt! Hurt!
Rachel  All right Ross!! I get it!!
Ross  I mean my God...
Rachel  You're hurt!
Ross  ...can't, can't a guy send a barbershop quartet to his girlfriend's office
anymorrrrre!!
Rachel  Oh, please, Ross it was so obvious! It was like you were marking your
territory. I mean you might have well have just come in and peed all around my desk!
Ross  I would never do that!
Rachel  Look, I know what's going on here, okay, Mark explained it all to me. He
said this is what you guys do.
Ross  Yeah well if, if, if Mark said that, than Mark's an idiot.
[Scene  Central Perk, Chandler, Ross, Joey are there.]
Joey  Mark's a genius!
Ross  Why?! How?! How is he a genius?
Chandler  Look, don't you see what's happening here. Instead of hitting on her
right away, he's becoming her confidant. Now he's gonna be the guy she goes too to
complain about you.
Ross  What am I going to do?
Chandler  Well, why don't you send her a musical bug, op, no you already did
that. All right look, you're going to have to go there yourself now, okay, make a few
surprise visits.
Ross  I don't know you guys.
Chandler  All right fine, don't do anything, just sit here and talk to us,
meanwhile she is talking to him about you. And he's being Mr. Joe Sensitive, and she
starts thinking 'Maybe this is the guy for me, because he understands me.'
Joey  And before you know it, she's with him. And you'll be all, 'Ohh, man!' And
he'll be all, 'Yes!' And us, we'll be like, 'Wh-whoa, dude.' And pretty soon you'll be
like, (sadly) 'Hhiii,' and, and, and, 'I can't go, Rachel and Mark might be there.' And
we'll be like, 'Man get over it, it's been four years!!'
Chandler  He paints quite a picture doesn't he?
[Scene  Rachel's office.]
Woman  (walking up to Mark) Here's the Shelly Siegal stuff from December.
Mark  (turning around) And wait, I've got something for you. (kisses her)
Woman  Mark!!
Mark  It's okay, Rachel knows.
Woman  Yeah, but even soo.
Mark  I can't help it, I'm just, I'm just crazy about you.
Rachel  Ohhh! That is soo sweet! (gets up to get herself a cup of coffee)
Mark  Okay, okay look, I know I'm being Mr. Inappropriate today, but it's just
so tough, I mean see you walking around and I just wanna touch you and hold you, come on
no one's around, just, just kiss me.
Ross  All right that's, that's it!! Get off her!
Mark  What is going on?
Ross  What's going on?! (throws the love bug at him) That's what's going on!!
Rachel  (now standing behind Ross) Ross!
Ross  I have been down in your store for twenty minutes trying to get a tie!
What do I have to do to get some service?! (turns to Rachel) Hi Rach. (He's puts his hand
on her shoulder and she knocks it away.)
[Scene  Joey's dance audition, Joey is warming up.]
Director  Ah Joey. Joey Tribbiani. Listen Joey, I got a problem, I just got a
call from my dance captain, he's having a relationship crisis and can't get out of Long
Island.
Joey  So, does that mean the audition is off?
Director  Listen Joey, seeing as you've got the most experience, I want you to
take these dancers and show them the combination.
Joey  What?!
Director  Aw come on Joey, it's easy. Y'know, it's hand, hand, head, head, (very
quickly, Joey watches stunned) up, pas de bouree, pas de bouree, big turn here, grand
sissone, sissone, sissone, slide back, step, step, step, and jazz hands!
Joey  It's ah, step-ity, step and jazz hands.
Director  Have fun.
Joey  Bye. (does the jazz hands)
[Scene  Monica and Rachel's, Monica is tying a ribbon to a vase.]
Phoebe  (entering) Hey!
Monica  Hey.
Phoebe  What are you wrapping?
Monica  Oh-ho, look what I got Julio.
Phoebe  Yeah, it's a vase.
Monica  Yeah, just like the one in the poem.
Phoebe  Well not exactly like the one in the poem.
Monica  What do you mean?
Phoebe  Remember how you said you were really dense about poetry? Oh. (hugs her)
[Scene  The Moondance Diner.]
Monica  (to Julio) So! I'm just an empty vase, huh?
Julio  What?
Monica  Y'know, so I don't read as many important books as you do, and I don't
write trick poems that seem to be about one thing but are actually about something else.
And y'know what, I get excited about stupid stuff, like when I my People magazine
comes on Saturday, and the new Hold Everything catalog. Y'know but that does not
mean that I'm empty, I care about things. I care about my friends and family. You have no
right to make that kind of judgment about me.
Julio  Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Monica  You don't even know me...
Julio  Whoa, whoa, whoa, the poem is not about you.
Monica  What?
Julio  The Empty Vase is not about you. My baby, you make me so sad that you
would think this.
Monica  I'm sorry, my friend Phoebe...
Julio  No, it's about all women. Well, all American women. You feel better now?
Monica  (sarcastically) Oh yeah.
[Scene  Joey's audition, the director has returned and wants to see the combination.]
Director  All right, let's do it!
Director  No, no, no. What was that?
Joey  I know, it was the best I could get out of them.
Director  Well, people!
Joey  People, people, people.
Director  Let's try it again, and this time let's watch everybody watch Joey.
(to Joey) Show 'em how it's done. (to the pianist) Count it off.
[Scene  Central Perk, Chandler and Rachel are there.]
Rachel  So ah, did you have fun at the bachelor party last night?
Chandler  Oh yeah, yeah! Look what I got, look what I got. (holds up a pen) See,
she's fully dressed, right?
Rachel  Right.
Chandler  And then you click it and, uh-oh, she's naked. And then, and then you
click it again and she's dressed. She's a business woman, she's walking down the street,
she's window shopping, and (clicks pen) whoa-whoa-whoa, sh-she's naked! (Rachel just
stares at him.)
Ross  (entering) Hi.
Rachel  Hello.
Chandler  Y'know what, I'm, I'm gonna spend some alone time with the pen.
Ross  (sits down next to her) I'm sorry, I was an idiot.
Rachel  A big idiot.
Ross  A big idiot. Just you have to realize is, this whole Mark thing is kinda
hard for me.
Rachel  Honey, why is it hard, I mean we've been together for almost a year now?
Ross  Well, I was with Carol for like eight years and I lost her. And now if
it's possible I think I love you even more. So, it's hard for me to believe that I'm not
gonna, well that someone else is not going to take you away.
Gunther  Let it be me! Let it be me!
Rachel  Honey, that's very sweet, it just seems to me though, that if two people
love each other and trust each other, like we do, there's no reason to be jealous. (she
kisses him)
Ross  I gotta get going. Bye Chandler.
Chandler  Oh, okay Ross. Listen, this pen is kinda getting boring, so can you
pick me up some porn?
Rachel  Where ya going?
Ross  Oh, I've got to go pick up Ben, we've got a play date this afternoon.
Rachel  Ohh, with who?
Ross  Oh, just this woman that I met last night at the party.
Rachel  There was a woman at the... (realizes) The stripper?!
Ross  Yeah.
Rachel  You have a play date with a stripper?!
Chandler  Man, I gotta get a kid. (looks at the pen and starts laughing)
Ross  Ah, yeah, yeah. Umm, we started talking after she y'know, did her thing.
And it turns out she's got a boy about Ben's age, so we're taking them to a gym-boree
class. Why, is that okay?
Rachel  Sure, is she married?
Ross  Ahh, no.
Rachel  Oh. (starts shaking the sugar down in a packet really hard.)
Ross  Are you jealous?
Rachel  Noo, I y'know I don't see why she has to play with you, that's all. I
mean doesn't she have any y'know other stripper moms friends of her own?
Ross  You are totally jealous.
Rachel  I'm not jealous. All right this is about, umm, people feeling certain
things y'know about strippers. And y'know, and um, I...
Ross  Honey, I love you too.
Rachel  Ugh. Wait, wait, wait.
Ross  What?
Ross  Huh.
Rachel  (to Chandler) Well, there's a kiss that he won't forget for a couple of
hours, y'know.
Chandler  Yeah. Either that, or you just turned him on and sent him off to a
stripper.
[Scene  The Moondance Diner.]
Man  (entering) Is there a Julio here?
Julio  (to him) I am Julio.
Man  (singing) Mister Pretensous, (Monica stands up in the background) you think
there's no one finer, well but your poems are unpublished, and you work in a diner.
Quartet  Your no God's gift to women, that's all in your headdddd. You are just
a buttmunch.
Bass Singer  No one likes a buttmunch.
Quartet  And your also bad in bedd-edd-edd!.
[Scene  A Video Store, Monica is running in to return a video.]
Monica  (to clerk) Hi.
Clerk  Six dollars, please.
Monica  Six? I just had it for one night. Its three.
Monica  Y'know in a weird way, you have too much power. Look, youre gonna
have to help me out here, cause I only have three.
Richard  (standing behind her, without his moustache) I can help with that.
Monica  Oh my God. Richard? (turns around) Hi!
Richard  Hi!
Monica  Wow! Your lip went bald. (Richard pays the clerk) Hey, thanks.
Richard  So, you look great.
Monica  Right.
Richard  No you do. You... just...
Monica  What?
Richard  Youve got panties stuck to your leg.
Monica  (removes them) Thats because I-I was just grabbing some things out
of the dryer, and its static cling. Or maybe its just that God knew Id
be running into you and saw an opportunity.
Richard  Its good to see you.
Monica  Its good to see you too.
[Scene  continued from earlier.]
Monica  You see that guy? Hes in classics now, but y'know as soon as we
leave hes going straight to the porn.
Richard  Hes gonna go up to the counter with Citizen Kane, Vertigo,
and Clockwork Orgy. (they both laugh) This is nice.
Monica  Yeah.
Richard  I missed this.
Monica  Me too.
Richard  So, you wanna get a hamburger or something?
Monica  Oh, um, I dont know if thats a good idea.
Richard  Oh. Look, just friends, I wont grope you. I promise.
Monica  No, I just I think that its too soon.
Richard  No its not too soon, I had lunch at a eleven.
[Scene  Monica and Rachel's, Chandler, Ross. Joey, and Rachel are eating breakfast.
Chandler is holding a bottle of Herseys Syrup.]
Chandler  Yeah, baby!
Ross  What are you doing?
Chandler  Making chocolate milk. Do you want some?
Ross  No thanks. Im 29.
Rachel  (looking at her watch) Oh my God, I gotta go to work!
Ross  Oh sweetie, when do you think youre going to get off tonight?
Rachel  Oh I dont know honey. Its gonna be really late.
Ross  Oh come on, not again.
Rachel  I know. Im sorry. Look, Ill make a deal with you all right?
Okay?
Ross  Hmm.
Rachel  For every night that youre asleep before I get home from work...
Ross  Yeah.
Rachel  I will wake you up in a way thats proved very popular in the past.
Ross  Now, if you need to stay late, I want to be supportive of that.
Rachel  Right.
Phoebe  (entering, holding a pair of Roller Blades) Hi.
All  Hey.
Joey  (to Phoebe) Look at you. Since when do you roller blade?
Phoebe  Oh! Since tomorrow. I met this really cute guy in the park and he like
y'know, jogs, and blades, and swims, and so y'know we made a deal thats hes
going to teach me all sorts of jock stuff.
Ross  And what are you going to do for him?
Phoebe  Im going to let him.
Ross  Okay.
Joey  Cool.
Monica  (entering from her bedroom) Morning.
All  Hey.
Rachel  Somebody got in late last night.
Monica  Yeah well, I ran into Richard.
Rachel  When did this happen?
Phoebe  Oh, theres no such thing as an innocent burger.
Ross  So, are you gonna see him again?
Monica  Tomorrow night.
Rachel  Monica, what are you doing?
Chandler  Well, she spent the last six months getting over him, and now
shes celebrating that by going on a date with him.
Monica  Its not a date, okay. Im just gonna teach him how to make
lasagne for some pot luck dinner he has.
Joey  Well, you might wanna make a little extra, y'know youll probably be
hungry after the sex.
Monica  Were not gonna have sex! Okay, nothings changed here. He
still doesnt want children and I still do, so thats why were just gonna
be friends.
Ross  Naked friends.
[Scene  Chandler and Joey's, Joey is watching TV.]
Rachel  (entering) Hey.
Joey  Hey.
Rachel  Do you have any ice?
Joey  Check the freezer. If theres none in there, then were probably
out. Are you just getting in from work? Its late.
Rachel  Yeah, I know. I had the greatest day though, I got to sit in on the
meeting with the reps from Calvin Klien. I told my boss I liked this line of
lingerie, she ordered a ton of it. How was your day?
Joey  I discovered Im able to count all of my teeth using just my tongue.
Rachel  Hmm. (she opens the freezer) Umm, why do you have a copy of The
Shining in your freezer?
Joey  Oh, I was reading it last night, and I got scared, so.
Rachel  But ah, youre safe from it if its in the freezer?
Joey  Well, safer. Y'know, I mean I never start reading The Shining,
without making sure weve got plenty of room in the freezer, y'know.
Rachel  How often do you read it?
Joey  Havent you ever read the same book over and over again?
Rachel  Well, umm, I guess I read Little Women more than once. But I mean
thats a classic, whats so great about The Shining?
Rachel  Okay. Ah, well well just see about that, okay. I will read The
Shining, (she tries to take the book away from him but he doesnt want to let it
go) and you will read Little Women.
Joey  All right, you got it.
Rachel  All right.
Joey  Okay.
Rachel  Okay.
Joey  Ah, now Rach, these ah, these little women.
Rachel  Yeah.
Joey  How little are they? I mean, are they like scary little?
[Scene  Central Perk, Chandler and Ross are there, Phoebe is entering with her date
Robert.]
Phoebe  Um, Chandler, Ross, this is Robert.
Chandler  Oh, hey.
Robert  Hi.
Ross  Hey.
Phoebe  (to Robert) Youve have lipstick right here (points to her cheek).
Thats okay, its mine, we just kissed.
Ross  Oh.
Chandler  (to Robert) So ah, isnt a bit cold out for shorts?
Robert  Well, Im from California.
Chandler  Right, right. Sometimes you guys just burst into flames.
Chandler  (standing up) Im up! Im up, Ive gotten up now!
Anybody ah, want anything?
Phoebe  Ill have coffee.
Robert  Yeah, me too.
Ross  Yeah, make that three.
Chandler  Okay Ross, why dont you come with me?
Ross  Okay. (goes over to the counter) (to Chandler) What ah, what is the matter
with you? Whats going on?
Chandler  Roberts coming out.
Ross  What, what do you mean, what? Is he gay?
Chandler  No. He.....hes coming out of his shorts.
Ross  What?!
Chandler  The man is showing brain.
Robert  Coffee.
Ross  Okay.
Robert  We could write it down for you?
Ross  No, no, that wont be ah, that wont be necessary (leans down
and looks up Roberts shorts, seeing Roberts package.)
Chandler  (to Ross) Wellll?
Ross  Yeah, yeah, yeah!
Chandler  What do we do? What do we do?
Ross  Well, I suppose we just try to not look directly at it.
Chandler  Like an eclipse.
[Scene  Monica and Rachel's, Monica is teaching Richard how to make lasagne.]
Richard  So when people complement me on my cooking should I, what do I say?
Monica  You say Thank you very much, and then you buy me something
pretty. Come on, were gonna put are hands in this bowl, and were gonna start
squishing the tomatoes.
Richard  Ew, this feels very weird.
Monica  You touch peoples eyeballs every day and this feels weird.
Richard  Yeah, well, sure I touch them, but I spent years learning not to squish
them. (Monica grabs his hand in the tomatoes.) Thats my hand.
Monica  Oops.
Richard  Okay.
Monica  Gotta keep squishing.
Richard  Tomatoes are squishing.
Monica  Okay.
Richard  Op.
Monica  Oh, gosh, you got some on your shirt.
Richard  Yeah.
Monica  Hold on a second, just put a little club soda on it (does so) and it
should umm, be.....
Richard  What?
Monica  Umm, youve got some on your pants.
Richard  Ill just throw them out.
[Scene  Central Perk, Chandler is watching Joey read Little Women, Ross is also
there.]
Joey  These little women. Wow!
Chandler  Your liking it, huh?
Joey  Oh yeah! Amy just burned Jos manuscript. I dont see how he
could ever forgive her.
Ross  Umm, Jos a girl, its short for Josephine.
Joey  But Jos got a crush on Laurie. (Ross nods his head) Oh. You mean
its like a girl-girl thing? Cause that is the one thing missing from The
Shining.
Chandler  No, actually Lauries a boy.
Joey  No wonder Rachel had to read this so many times.
Phoebe  Hey!
Chandler  Hey.
Ross  Hey! Howd the ah, basketball go?
Phoebe  Oh, okay, I learned how to shoot a lay-up, a foul shot, and a
twenty-three pointer.
Chandler  You mean a three pointer?
Phoebe  Oh, I get more because Im dainty.
Robert  So um, is there a phone here, I can check my messages?
Phoebe  Yeah, in the back. You want a quarter?
Robert  Oh, no thanks. I always carry one in my sock.
Joey  (noticing Chandler) What are you doing? (he pushes Chandler back to his
side of the couch) Get back over on your side of the... (sees Robert in all his glory)
Hello!! (to Robert) Hi, Im Joey, we havent met.
Robert  Ah, good to meet you. Robert.
Phoebe  What? (the guys keep laughing.) What? You guys, what is going on? You
not like Robert? (the guys keep laughing.) Why are you laughing?!
Ross  Calm down. Theres no reason to get testy.
Phoebe  You guys!! Come on!
Chandler  Im sorry, Im sorry, it just seems that Robert isnt
as concealed in the shorts area, as ah, one may have hoped.
Phoebe  What do you mean?
Robert  Hey. (sits down)
Phoebe  Hey.
Joey  Hey Robert, could you ah, ha, pass me those cookies?
Robert  Sure.
[Scene  Monica and Rachel's, Monica is talking to Richard on the phone.]
Monica  So, howd the lasagne go over? (listens) Really?! Good. So you owe
me three pretty things. (listens) Yeah, Ive been thinking a lot about you too.
(listens) I know. Its hard this whole platonic thing. (listens) Its a word!
Monica  Yeah, I do think its better this way. (listens) Yeah, were
being smart. (gets up to answer the door) (listens) Yes, Im sure.(she opens the door
and its Richard)
Richard  You really sure?
Monica  Ill call you back. (starts kissing him)
[Scene  Monicas bedroom, shes in bed with Richard.]
Monica  So we can be friends who sleep together.
Richard  Absolutely, this will just be something we do, like racquetball.
Monica  Sounds smart and healthy to me. So um, just out of curiosity, um, do you
currently have any other racquetball buddies?
Richard  Just your dad. (pause) Although thats actually racquetball. You
know I-I do have a blind date with my sisters neighbour next Tuesday.
Monica  Oh.
Richard  You want me to cancel it?
Monica  No! (pushes him) No!
Richard  Okay.
Monica  Cause if you do that means youd be cancelling it for me, and
were just friends.
Richard  Exactly. (pushes her back)
[Scene  Central Perk, Robert is picking up Phoebe for a date.]
Robert  Hey.
Phoebe  Hey. Ooh! Dont sit down!
Robert  You ready to go to the batting cage?
Phoebe  Yeah. And, first heres a gift.
Robert  Oh! Wow! Hey!
Chandler  Stretchy pants! Why, those are the greatest things in the world! If I
were you I would wear them every day, every day!
Robert  Jeez, thank you really that is so nice. But um, to be honest, I
dont think I can wear these, theyre so tight, I feel like Im on display.
Im sorry.
Phoebe  Thats all right, thats well, I figured.... (they start to
leave as Joey enters.)
Robert  (to Joey) Hey!
Joey  Hey! (starts to laugh.) Hows it going?
Ross  Good.
Joey  Hey, Rach, how you doing with The Shining?
Rachel  Oh, Danny just went into room 217.
Joey  Oooh, the next parts the best, when that dead lady in the bathtub...
Rachel  Oh, no, meh-nah-nah-nah, come on youre gonna ruin it!
Joey  All right Ill talk in code. (to Ross and Chandler) Remember when the
kid sees those two blanks in the hallway?
Chandler  Hmmm, thats very cool.
Joey  Oh, all blank, and no blank, makes blank a blank blank. Oh no-no-no,
no, the end when Jack almost kills them all with that blank, but then at last second they
get away. Aww!
Rachel  Joey! I cant believe you just did that!
Chandler  I cant believe she cracked your code!
Rachel  All right, okay, Laurie proposes to Jo, and she says no, even though
shes still in love with him, and then he ends up marring Amy.
Joey  Hey! Mine was by accident! All right, the boiler explodes and destroys the
hotel, and kills the dad.
Rachel  Eh. Beth dies.
Joey  Beth, Beth dies?
Rachel  Um-hmm.
Joey  Is that true? If I keep reading is Beth gonna die?
Chandler  No, Beth doesnt die, she doesnt die. Does she Rachel?
Rachel  What?!
Ross  Joeys asking if youve just ruined the first book hes
ever loved that didnt star Jack Nicholson?
Rachel  No. She doesnt die.
Joey  Then why would you say that?!
Rachel  Because, I wanted to hurt you.
Robert  (running in) Oh, there they are! I-I dropped my keys.
Rachel  (gasps) Oh my....
Robert  Got em.
[Scene  Monica and Rachel's, Rachel is reading The Shining, as Monica enters.]
Monica  Hi.
Rachel  (screams and grabs a potato masher to defend herself) Sorry. Im
sorry.
Monica  You would not believe my day! I had to work two shifts, and then to top
it off, I lost one of my fake boobs, (opens her coat revealing a large burn mark over her
left breast.) in a grill fire.
Monica  What are you smiling at?
Rachel  Im sorry, I was just thinking youre day could still pick up.
Monica  Yeah, right.
Richard  Hello.
Monica  I love this friend thing!
[Scene  Central Perk, Phoebe, Chandler, and Ross are there.]
Phoebe  Listen, Roberts gonna be here any second so, will one of you just
tell him?
Ross  Oh.
Phoebe  Please, right now, no, every time I see him its like Is it
on the lose? Is it watching me?
Chandler  We cant tell him, you cant go up to a guy you barely know
and talk about his.... stuff.
Ross  Hes right, even if its to say something complementary. (He
stops and thinks about what he just said.)
Robert  (entering) Hey!
Phoebe  Hey.
Robert  (to Phoebe) So are ready for the gym? Theyve got this new rock
climbing wall, we can spot each other.
Phoebe  No, I can spot you from here.
Robert  What?
Phoebe  Okay, listen Robert...
Ross  (to Chandler) Hey, dont we have to...
Chandler  Yeah, we got, um-hmm.
Phoebe  Umm, I think youre really, really great...
Robert  Oh God! Here we go again. Why does this keep happening to me? (spreads
his legs) Is it something Im putting out there? Is this my fault? Or am I just nuts?
Phoebe  I-I-I-I-I dont know, I dont know what to say.
Gunther  (cleaning up the table) (to Robert) Hey buddy, this is a family place,
put the mouse back in the house.
[Scene  Richards bedroom, Monica has covered it in rose pedals and candles. We
hear Richard come in to the apartment, and Monica frantically throws the rest of the
pedals on the bed, and jumps onto the bed and puts a rose in her mouth, and bites a
thorn.]
Monica  Ow!
Richard  (outside the bedroom) Really?! Well, its just like everyone
elses apartment. Its got rooms, walls, and ceilings.
Richards Date  Well, I just wanted to see where you lived. Now, give me
the tour.
Monica  Oh my God! Oh my God! (She frantically tries to clean up the bedroom as
Richard starts the tour.)
Richard  Ah well, this is the living room.
Richards Date  Impressive.
Richard  All right. This is the kitchen.
Richards Date  Oh, thats real pretty. Wait a minute, dont I
get to see the bedroom?
Richard  The bedroom. Well its pretty much your typical... (opens the door
as Monica hides under the covers, and quickly closes the door before his date can see the
room.) bedroom.
Richards Date  Were still on this side of the door.
Richard  Um-hmm.
Richards Date  Yeah, but I didnt get to see it.
Richard  Oh shoot! Maybe next time. (yawns) Thanks for a lovely evening. (shows
her out)
Monica  (still hiding under the blankets) So um, who was she?
Richard  Oh, (laughs) that was the blind date that I told you about, she called
and switched it to today.
Monica  (still hiding under the blankets) Did you like her? And Im just
asking as a friend, because I am totally fine with this.
Richard  Well, you seem fine.
Monica  (gets up) Okay, y'know what, Im not fine, Im not. I mean how
can I be fine, hearing you come in with her, she wants to see your bedroom.... (pause)
Y'know what, what if were friends who dont see other people?
Richard  You mean like exclusive friends?
Monica  Why not?! I mean this has been the most amazing week. Would it be so
terrible? Even if we were friends who lived together. Or, maybe someday friends who stood
up in front of their other friends, and vowed to be friends forever.
Richard  Wow. Y'know were back where we were. Honey, I would love to do
all that, but nothings changed.
Monica  Thats not true, you dont have a moustache.
Richard  Okay, okay, one things changed. But we still want different
things and we know how this is gonna end.
Monica  Y'know what, Ive got to walk out of here right now, cause
getting over you is the hardest thing that I have ever had to do. I dont think I
could do it again.
Richard  I know I couldnt. So....
Monica  How bout one last game of racquetball?
Monica  Watch the thorns!
Richard  (lying down) Ow!!
[Scene  Monica and Rachel's, Joey is entering, and hes very dejected.]
Rachel  What?
Joey  Beth is really, really sick.
Rachel  Awwww.
Joey  Jos there, but I dont think theres anything she could
do.
Rachel  Joey?
Joey  Yeah.
Rachel  Do you want to put the book in the freezer?
Joey  (nodding his head) Okay.
Rachel  Okay.
[Scene  Central Perk, the gang, except Rachel, is watching a new singer.]
Singer  (singing) Cause every time I see your face, I cant help but
fall from grace. I know.....
Joey  Wow! This girl is good.
Phoebe  Oh-ho yeah! A song with rhyming words. Oo, I never thought of that
before.
Chandler  I like her.
Phoebe  (to Chandler) Why? Because she can sing and play guitar and do both at
the same time?
Chandler  Well, thats pretty much all Im looking for from these
people.
Monica  (to Phoebe) Look at you. All jealous.
Ross  Yeah Pheebs, come on, you two have completely different styles. Y'know,
shes more..(shakes his shoulders, like hes dancing) y'know, and youre
more (sees the look from Phoebe and stops)
Singer  (singing) beside meeeee-eeee-ee. (everyone applauds her).
Phoebe  Okay, see, see, everyone else is happy shes done.
Phoebe  Oh no, one of those look for the hidden meaning songs.
[Scene  Central Perk, later.]
Singer  Hey Phoebe.
Phoebe  Hey Leslie, howd you know Id be here?
Leslie  I ran into Vlad at the place where they sell the big fish, and he said
you played here a lot, so umm....
Chandler  (to Ross) All right listen, I have to go to the bathroom, but if the
place with the big fish comes up again. Id like know whether thats several big
fish or just one big fish.
Joey  (to Leslie) So ah, Phoebe tells us you write jingles.
Phoebe  Actually I said she abandoned me to write jingles.
Joey  (to Leslie) Ah, anything we might of heard of?
Leslie  Ah, yeah, umm. (singing) Home is never far away..
Monica, Ross, and Joey  (joining in) Home is Home Star stew.
Leslie  Yeah, but, I dont do that anymore. I got kinda sick of it, and
then I couldnt come up with anything good, so they fired me.
Phoebe  Hmm, bummer.
Leslie  Well, I y'know, I was just, umm, I was just thinking and hoping, that
umm, maybe youd want to get back together?
Phoebe  No. But thanks.
Leslie  Aw come on Phoebe would you just think about it?
Phoebe  Okay. No. But thanks.
Leslie  Okay, ah, see ya Pheebs. (leaves)
Joey  (to Phoebe) Wow, that was kinda brutal.
Phoebe  Well okay, let this be a lesson to all of you, all right. Once you, once
you betray me, I become like the ice woman, yknow. Very cold, hard, unyielding,
y'know nothing, nothing can penetrate this icy exterior. (to Monica) Can I have a
tissue, please?
Monica  Yeah, sure.
[Scene  Outside the bathroom, Chandler is pacing back and fourth, waiting is use it.]
Gunther  (to Chandler) Someone in there?
Chandler  No. This is just part of a dare devil game that I play called
wait until the last moment before I burst and die.
Chandler  Jeez, man did you fall..(sees its a beautiful woman coming out
of the mens room) Hi! So ah, did ya, did-did-did ya fall high?
Woman  Someone was in the lady's room, I couldnt wait. I left the lid up
for ya though.
Chandler  (to Gunther) Y'know what Gunther, go ah, go ahead, Im-Im
talking to ah, (tries to get her to say her name). (to her) This is the part where you say
your name.
Woman  Ginger.
Chandler  Ginger. Im talking to Ginger, so....
Ginger  Dont you have to use the bathroom?
Chandler  Nope, nope, Id just ah, Id rather talk to you. (pause)
Yes, I do. Yes, I do have to go to the bathroom. (knocks on the door)
Gunther  Someone in here.
[Scene  Central Perk, the gangs putting their coats on to leave.]
Phoebe  Wheres Chandler?
Joey  Ah, he cant make it, he said he had to his... (sees Ginger) Whoa-oh!
(hides behind the coat rack.)
Ginger  Joey? Joey Tribbiani?
Ginger  Joey I can see you okay? Youre hiding behind the coats.
Joey  Phew, close one.
[Scene  Rachels office, Mark is packing his stuff into a box.]
Ross  Hi.
Rachel  Hi, sweetie!
Ross  Hello.
Mark  Hi, Ross.
Ross  Yeah, huh.
Rachel  Ive got some bad news.
Ross  What?
Rachel  I can get a quick bite to eat, but then I have to come back up here.
Ross  Come on sweetie! Youve had to work late every night for the past two
weeks, what is it this time?
Mark  Actually, its kinda my fault. I-I quit today.
Ross  (to Rachel) But work comes first! (to Mark) Oh hey, but thats sad
about you though, what happened? Burn out? Burn all out, did ya?
Rachel  Nooo, hes leaving for a better job.
Ross  Oh well thats great, so I guess this is ah, this is good bye then.
Huh? (picks a pad up off Rachels desk and tosses it into his box) Good bye.
Mark  Okay, then.
Ross  Okay.
Rachel  Well were gonna miss you around here.
Mark  Yeah, me too.
Mark  So, see ya on Saturday.
Rachel  Yeah, you bet.
[Scene  Monica and Rachel's, Phoebe and Monica are playing with a Ouija board,
Phoebes beeper goes off and Monica screams.]
Phoebe  Oh. (takes her beeper puts in a pot, covers it, and puts the pot in the
oven)
Monica  Y'know those are a delicacy in India.
Phoebe  Yeah, that was Leslie calling again to see if we can get back together.
Thats the twentieth time today! And good luck Leslie!
Monica  Wow, she must have hurt you pretty bad, huh?
Phoebe  Well, yeah. Y'know, we were best friends, ever since we were little, our
Moms worked on the barge together.
Monica  Oh, you two must have been so cute running around on a barge.
Phoebe  You never run on a barge!
Joey  (entering) Hey.
Phoebe and Monica  Hey.
Joey  Is ah, is Chandler around?
Monica  No, umm, he met some girl at the coffee house.
Joey  Oooh.
Monica  Yeah, Ginger something.
Joey  Nooo. No, no, ah, are you sure it wasnt something that sounded like
Ginger, like ah, Gingeer?
Monica  No, it was Ginger. I remember, because when he told me, I said,
(singing) the movie star.
Joey  Aww, man. Thats the girl I was hiding from. When she finds out
hes my roommate, shes gonna tell him what I did.
Monica  Well, what did you do?
Joey  What, oh, oh, oh, no, no, I cant, I cant tell you that,
its like the most awful, horrible thing Ive ever done my whole life.
Monica  Y'know what, dont tell us. Well just wait until Chandler
gets home, (to Phoebe) because itll be more fun that way.
Joey  All right!! Okay, it was like four years ago. Okay, Ginger and I had gone
out a few times, and then this one weekend, we went up to her Dads cabin. Just me,
her, and her annoying little dog Pepper. Well that night, I cooked this really romantic
dinner....
Monica  You gave her food poisoning!?
Joey  I wish. No. After dinner, me, her, and Pepper all fell asleep in front of
the fire. Well I woke up in the middle of the night and I saw that the fire was dying out.
So, I picked up a log and threw it on. Or, at least what I thought was a log.
Phoebe  Oh my God!! You threw Pepper on the fire!
Joey  I wish. See, I guess another thing I probably shouldve told you
about Ginger is that she kinda has a ah, artificial leg.
Monica  Oh my God! Joey, what did you do after you threw her leg on the fire?
Joey  I ran!!
[Scene  A street, Chandler is kissing Ginger.]
Chandler  Well, thats the best kiss Ive had with anyone Ive
ever met in a mens room.
Ginger  Actually, me too.
Chandler  (sees her foot is in a slush puddle) Op, foot in a puddle, foot all in
a puddle.
Ginger  Oh damn, I hate that.
Chandler  Yeah, were gonna have to get you out of those shoes.
Ginger  Oh, dont worry about it.
Chandler  No, really youre gonna freeze.
Ginger  No, Im not.
Chandler  Youre not, what do you, what do you got a bionic foot?
Ginger  Some day, maybe.
[Scene  Rosss bedroom, Rachel getting into bed while Ross is reading and laughs.]
Rachel  Funny book?
Ross  Hmmm. Oh, no, no, I just thinking about something funny I heard today.
Umm, Mark, Mark saying Ill see you Saturday.
Rachel  Yeah, at the lecture, I told you that last week, you said you
didnt mind.
Ross  Oh, no, no, no, its-its not the lecture ah, I mind, umm....
Rachel  Oh, please tell me its not because Im going with Mark.
Ross  Oh, well...
Rachel  Oh my God!!! Ross!!
Ross  Well, Im sorry, but ah, look if youre not working with him
anymore, why do you have to still do stuff with him?
Rachel  Because, hes my friend.
Ross  Okay, but do you really need another friend? I mean...
Rachel  Okay, well if I stop playing with Joey and Chandler, can I play with
Mark?
Ross  Is that funny? Am I supposed to be laughing?
Rachel  I dont know, you thought See you Saturday was funny.
Look honey, Mark is in fashion okay, I like having a friend that I can share this stuff
with. You guys would never want to go to a lecture with me.
Ross  Pa-haa!! I would love to go with you.
Rachel  Really!?
Ross  Yeah, hey I-I have clothes, I even pick them out. I mean for, for all you
know I could be a fashion..... monger.
Rachel  Okay. Honey, I would love for you to go with me. (Ross has a worried
look on his face) What?
Ross  What should I wear, now Im all nervous.
[Scene  Monica and Rachel's, Phoebe is looking at her beeper still in the pot. She
takes it out, shakes it, and puts it back in.]
Monica  Y'know they say a watched pot never beeps.
Phoebe  Its just y'know, been a couple of hours, and she hasnt
called. Not that I even care, y'know.
Monica  Phoebe why dont you just call her? You obviously want to.
Phoebe  You think you know me so well.
Monica  Well, dont cha wanna?
Phoebe  Yeah.
Monica  Okay, well I do know you.
Phoebe  Thats what I said.
Monica  Well so?
Phoebe  I cant. I cant. She dumped me, I mean I totally trusted her
and then one day it was Okay, bye Pheebs gone. Y'know what the saddest part
is, when we were playing together, that was like the most fun Ive ever had in like
all my lives.
[Scene  Central Perk, Leslie is singing.]
Leslie  (singing) My best shoes, so good to me. I wear them everyday. Down at
the heel, holes in the toes. Dont care what people say. My feets best friends,
pals to the end. With them Im one hot chicky. Though late one night, not much light,
I....
Phoebe  (singing) I stepped in something icky.
Phoebe and Leslie  (singing) Sticky shoes, sticky shoes, always make me smile.
Sticky shoes, sticky shoes, next time Ill.... avoid the..... pillleeeee.
[Scene  The lecture, Rachel is listening closely, Ross is bored out of his mind.]
Lecturer  Were beginning to see a lot of layering of sheer fabrics and
colours. For instance a sheer navy blouse over a pink....
Ross  (to Rachel) Im really glad we came. (Rachel smiles and rubs his arm)
Youre so pretty. I love you.
Rachel  Oh. (puts her hand over his mouth)
[Scene  Central Perk, Phoebe is teaching Leslie how to sing Smelly Cat.]
Phoebe  (singing) Smelly cat, smelly cat, what are they feeding you? Smelly cat,
smelly cat, its not your fault.
Leslie  Wow, thats great.
Phoebe  Oh, yeah!
Leslie  Y'know you could totally sell this. Itd be perfect for like umm, a
kitty litter campaign.
Phoebe  I..., a jingle? No, no-no-no, no.
Leslie  What? Why not? You could make a ton of money.
Phoebe  Okay, well if I was in this for the money, Id be a millionaire by
now, y'know. You just got to get out of that jingle head sweetie.
Leslie  Aw, youre right, youre right. Im sorry.
Phoebe  Thats okay. All right, Im gonna play song thats
really, really sad. Its called Magician Box Mix Up. (she turns her guitar upside
down to play it.)
[Scene  The lecture, Ross is passed out against Rachels shoulder.]
Lecturer  ....oversized bracelets, oversized earrings, oversizing of accessories
in general are very popular now.
[Scene  Chandler and Joey's, Chandler is reading the newspaper.]
Monica  (entering) Hi!
Chandler  Hey.
Monica  Oh, can I borrow this? (points to his milk) My milks gone bad.
Chandler  Oh, I hate that. I once had a thing of half and half, stole my car.
Monica  So umm, how was your date with Ginger?
Chandler  Great. It was great. Shes ah, shes great, great looking,
great personality, shes greatness.
Monica  Sounds like shes got the ah, whole package.
Chandler  Joey told you about the leg, huh?
Monica  Uh-huh.
Chandler  Oh God, it freaked me out. Okay, I know it shouldnt have, but it
did. I mean I like her, I dont want to stop seeing her, but every so often its
like Hey, y'know what, wheres your leg? I mean Im the smallest
person in the world arent I? Im the smallest person in the world.
Joey  (entering from his bedroom) Morning.
Chandler  (to Monica) Actually hes the smallest person in the world.
Joey  (to Chandler) Heard about the leg burnin huh?
Chandler  It came up.
Joey  Listen, I ah, I know its a longshot. But, by any chance did she find
that funny?
[Scene  Monica and Rachel's, Ross and Rachel are getting back from the lecture.]
Ross  (entering) So I nodded off a little.
Rachel  Nodded off!! Ross you were snoring. My fathers boat didnt
make that much noise when it hit rocks!
Ross  Come on! Forty-five minutes! Forty-five minutes the man talked about
strappy backed dresses.
Rachel  Well okay, how about four hours in a freezing museum auditorium
listening to Professor Pitstains and hes Hey everybody! Remember that thing
thats been dead for a gazillion years. Well theres this little bone we
didnt know it had!
Ross  First of all its Professor Pittain! And second of all, that little
bone, proved that, that particular dinosaur had wings, but didnt fly.
Ross  Y'know what, 100 million people went to see a movie about what I do, I
wonder how many people would go see a movie called, Jurassic Parka.
Rachel  Oh, that is so...
Ross  No-no-no, a bunch of out of control jackets take over an island. (Makes an
unusual sound, then he realises that he still has his jacket on and quickly tries to shake
it off, thinking its alive and attacking him.)
Rachel  Y'know if what I do is so lame, then why did you insist on coming with
me this morning? Huh? Was it so I just wouldnt go with Mark?
Ross  No. I... I wanted to be with you. I dont know, I feel like lately, I
feel like youre slipping away from me, y'know. With this new job, and all these new
people, and youve got this whole other life going on. I-I-I know its dumb, but
I hate that Im not a part of it.
Rachel  Its not dumb. But, maybe its okay that youre not a
part of it. Y'know what I mean? (Ross looks confused) I mean its like, I-I-I like
that youre not involved in that part of my life.
Ross  Thats a little clearer.
Rachel  Honey see, it doesnt mean that I dont love you. Because I
do. I love you, I love you so much. But my work its-its for me y'know,
Im out there, on my own, and Im doing it and its scary but I love it,
because its mine. I, but, I mean is that okay?
Ross  Sure, I-I-I... (hugs her and mouths No!!)
[Scene  Chandler and Joey's, Chandler and Ginger are eating dinner.]
Ginger  Your thinking about my leg arent you?
Chandler  No. No. Actually I forgot, what is the deal with that again?
Chandler  No. No. I dont think so.
Ginger  Okay. Its just like anything else, you just have to get used to
it.
Ginger  Whats that?
Chandler  Thats-thats my nubbin.
Ginger  Whats a nubbin?
Chandler  Its kinda a ah, a third nipple kinda thing.
Ginger  You have three nipples?
Chandler  Well, y'know two regulars. And ah one that barely qualifies as...
(starts to kiss her again, but she gets up.) Ahh, what?
Ginger  Nothing. I, I just remembered I have to leave.
Chandler  You ah, you have, you have to leave, now? How come?
Ginger  Ah well, its nubbin. Nothing! Umm. Y'know what, Ill see you
later. Okay. (She leaves and in the hall we see her shake her shoulders like when someone
runs their fingernails across a blackboard.)
[Scene  Central Perk, Phoebe is getting ready to sing as Leslie enters.]
Phoebe  (to Leslie) Oh, I thought you werent coming. What? Where were you?
Leslie  Come here, come here. (they go to the side of the stage) Okay,
dont get mad, okay.
Phoebe  Okay, dont give me a reason to get mad, okay
Leslie  I played Smelly Cat for the people at my old ad agency, they went nuts.
Phoebe  No, look, I told you that I didnt want you to try and sell it, and
you just, you big fat did it anyway. God, y'know what, I think five years ago I probably
wouldve done anything to play with you but, I can do it by myself. And if I
cant trust you then just forget it.
Leslie  No, no, I dont want to forget it.
Phoebe  Okay y'know what you have to choose. All right, if-if the most important
thing on the planet to you is this cat poopy thing then, okay you can have Smelly Cat, but
we wont be partners. So whats it gonna be?
[Scene  Monica and Rachel's, Phoebe, Monica, and Joey are watching TV.]
Commercial  (in the background their singing Smelly Cat) Problem odour in the
litter box? Dont change your kitty, change your kitty litter.
Monica  Sorry, Pheebs.
Joey  Yeah. You okay?
Phoebe  Yeah. I actually am, yeah. Y'know life-lifes gonna had you all
kinds of stuff, y'know you learn your little lessons and hopefully you grow. Wanna hear a
new song?
Joey  Yeah.
Monica  Wed love too.
Phoebe  Okay. (singing) Jingle bitch screwed me over! Go to hell jingle
whore! Go to hell Go to hell. Go to hell-hell-hell. Thats all I have so far.
[Scene  Monica and Rachel's, the whole gang except Chandler is there.]
Chandler  (entering, happily) Well hello!
Joey  Where have you been?
Chandler  The doctor.
Ross  Is everything okay?
Chandler  Oh yes! Just had me a little nubbin-ectomy. Yep! Two nipples, no
waiting.
Monica  Wow! Its like Rachel in High School.
Rachel  What?!!
Monica  Come on! Come on, I was kidding! It was such an obvious joke!
Chandler  That was an obvious joke, and I didnt think of it.
Why didnt I think of it? The source of all my powers. Oh dear God, what have I done!
[Scene  Monica and Rachel's, Joey is taking a jar of olives out of the
fridge.]
Joey  (to Monica) Hey, how much will you give me to eat this whole jar of
olives?
Monica  I wont give you anything, but youll owe me 2.95.
Joey  Done.
Phoebe  (entering) Hey. I need an atlas! I need an atlas!
Monica  Why? (in a motherlike tone) Do you have a report due?
Phoebe  I have a date with this diplomat I met while I was giving free massages
outside the UN and, I dont know where his country is.
Monica  Okay, lets start with the free messages outside the UN.
Phoebe  Oh!! Thats my new thing. I figure bodies at peace, make peace.
Monica  Wow! You might just get the first Nobel prize in rubbing. So what
country is this guy from?
Phoebe  Ick-neck-tree-anis..... Theres a g in there.
Monica  Wheres that?
Phoebe  In your atlas!
Monica  I dont have an atlas.
Phoebe  Oh.
Monica  Oh, but wait I do have a globe.
Phoebe  Oh.
Monica  Hold on.
Joey  So Pheebs whats this guy like?
Phoebe  Umm, well hes very dashing, y'know, and umm, very, very
sophisticated, and he doesnt speak any English, but according to his translator, he
totally gets me.
Monica  Kay, here you go. (Hands her this tiny little globe.)
Phoebe  What is this?
Monica  Its a globe and, a pencil sharpener.
Chandler  (entering) Hey, does anybody need anything copied? Im going down
to the Xerox place.
Monica  Oh, no thanks.
Chandler  Okay listen, just give me anything I can make two of.
Monica  Well, if you dont have anything to copy, why are you going down
there?
Joey  Yeah, are you just going down there to gawk at that hot girl with the
belly button ring again?
Chandler  Yeah! You wanna come?
Joey  Yeah!
[Scene  The Xerox place, Chandler and Joey are waiting in line.]
Chandler  Come on Chloe! Finish up with your customer first. Come on Chloe! Come
on Chloe!!
Issac  (to Chandler and Joey) Can I help you?
Chandler  Uh-oh.
Joey  Uh, y'know what, were having second thoughts about our copying
needs. And well need a little more time to think about it.
Issac  Chloe, switch with me, theres some guys here that got a crush on
you.
Chandler  (to Joey) Okay, that hurt us.
Chloe  Hi guys. I havent seen you since this morning.
Chandler  Well ah, ........y'know.
Chloe  Hey, what are you guys doing tomorrow night?
Joey  Both of us? (points to Chandler and himself)
Chloe  Maybe. Does that scare ya?
Chloe  Relax. Its just Issacs D.J.-ing at the Philly. You should
come.
Joey  Well be there.
Chloe  Great. Ill ah, see ya then.
Chandler  All right, rock on. (Does the Hang 10 sign, then hides his
face in shame.)
[Scene  A Street, Phoebe is walking along with the diplomat (Sergei) and his translator
(Mischa).]
Sergei  (something in Russian or Polish)
Mischa  Hes says, Walking with you makes this strange city, feel
like home.
Phoebe  Me too. Although this city is my home, so. So thats dumb what I
said, dont tell him I said that. Umm, you make something up. (Mischa does so and
Sergei kisses her hand.) Nice, (to Mischa) thank you. This is me. Here.
Mischa  (leaning in) Your eyes are very pretty.
Phoebe  (to Mischa) Thank you, very much! Oh! (to Sergei) Thank you!
Mischa  (leaning in) He would like to kiss you.
Phoebe  (to Mischa) Okay, y'know what, you dont have to do that now.
(Mischa translates that to Sergei) No-no-no-no!! Not him, you dont! (Mischa tells
Sergei he can proceed and steps away) Well the moments over.
Phoebe  Oh.
Mischa  Oy!
[Scene  Monica and Rachel's, Phoebe is showing Monica where Sergeis country is.]
Phoebe  (pointing to the globe) See there it is right there.
Monica  Wow! Its small.
Phoebe  Yeah. But Sergei said it took the Germans six weeks to get all the way
across it.
Monica  So you had fun, huh?
Phoebe  Yeah. Except for, y'know when youre on a date and youre
getting along really great but the guys translator keeps getting in the way.
Monica  No.
Ross  (entering) Hey.
Phoebe and Monica  Hey.
Ross  What is ah, Rach in her room?
Monica  Oh no, shes still at work, but she told me to tell you to call
her.
Ross  Oh what?! Is she gonna cancel on me again?! How can she do this?
Doesnt she know its our anniversary?
Monica  All right ah, Ross, this is the extent of my knowledge on the subject.
(holds up a notepad) Call Rachel.
Ross  Whats that on the bottom?
Monica  Oh thats my doodle of a ladybug, with a top hat. (to Phoebe)
Shes fancy.
Rachel  (answering her phone at work) Hello.
Ross  Hey, honey.
Rachel  Oh, hi.
Ross  Hey, whats going on?
Rachel  Well, there was a disaster in shipping and Ive got to get this
order in. Honey, Im so sorry, but it looks like Im gonna be here all night.
Ross  What, do you, well umm, oh how about I come up there?
Rachel  No-no-no, no, honey please, Ive got, Ive just have so much
to deal with.
Phoebe  (to Monica) Anyway, Im going out with Sergei again tonight, and
um, could you come and be the translators date? So that when we, its time for
our alone time, you two could split off. Y'know, hes really, hes kinda cute.
Monica  Yeah, well kinda cute, like really kinda cute, or kinda cute like your
friend Spackel Back Larry?
Phoebe  Hey, dont call him that! His name is Spackel Back Harry!
[Scene  Central Perk, Chandler and Joey are sitting on the big couch.]
Chandler  Hey, y'know what, maybe we should get going. I mean what time did
Chloe say we should be there?
Chandler  What time is it now?
Chandler  Yeah all right, so well hang out.
Joey  Yeah. Hey, remember when she brought up that thing about the three of us?
Chandler  Yes. Vividly.
Joey  She was kidding about that right?
Chandler  Yeah, I-I-I think so. (Pauses and thinks about it for a second) Yeah,
I-I think so...
Joey  God, that would be weird it that situation presented itself tonight, huh?
Chandler  Yeah. Yeah, I mean what, what would we do?
Joey  Dude, I dont know.
Chandler  She was kidding.
Joey  Yeah.
Chandler  She was.... But y'know what, just in case, maybe we should come up
with a set of ground rules.
Joey  Yeah, for sure. Okay. Probably want the first thing to be, never open your
eyes. Y'know, because you dont want to be doing something and then look up and see
something you dont want to be seeing.
Chandler  Yeah. Good call, nice one. Hold it!! Hold it! What if me eyes are
closed, and, and my hand is out there.... (holds his arm out and pretends to grab
something with his hand.)
Joey  Ah!! Okay! Eyes open at all times! Oh, hey, how do we decide where we...
(clears throat) y'know each would, (clears throat again) y'know (pause) be?
Chandler  Right. Right. Well ah, y'know we could flip for it.
Joey  Yeah, I guess, but whats like heads and whats tails?
Chandler  Well it you dont know that, then I dont want to do this
with you.
[Scene  Rachels office, Rachel and a co-worker (Sophie) are dealing with the
crisis.]
Rachel  (on the phone) No, no, no, Im looking at a purchase order right
here and it clearly states that we ordered the Rivera bikini in a variety of sizes and
colours. And.... (listens) What does it matter, what Im wearing?! Can I please speak
to your supervisor? (listens) Thank you. (to Sophie) Were holding.
Ross  (entering, carrying a basket) Hi!
Rachel  (startled) Oh!! My God, what are you doing here?
Ross  Well you said you couldnt go out so.... (pulls the cover off of the
basket)
Sophie  You brought a picnic, oh, what a boyfriend. Thats it, on Monday I
start wearing make-up.
Rachel  Ross honey, this is very nice, but, but I-I got a crisis.
Ross  Yeah, but I got cous-cous!
Rachel  Honey, honey, Im sorry, I know its our anniversary but I
told you on the phone I dont have time to stop.
Ross  Okay, you dont have to stop, Im invisible, Im not here.
(lights a candle)
Rachel  But I dont, hmm... (on phone) Oh, who approved that order?!
(listens) Well there is no Mark Robbinson in this office. (to Sophie) Get me Mark on the
phone!
Sophie  I love Mark. (to Ross) Do you know Mark?
Ross  Yeah!!
Rachel  Well, let me just check that with what I got here, all right see 038 is
not the number for (Ross starts making a lot of noise with a handheld pepper grinder) this
store, 038 is Atlanta. And I...(stops and looks at Ross)
Ross  (stopping grinding) Pepper?
Rachel  (angrily) None for me.
Ross  Okay sorry, whew.
Rachel  Im sorry, as I was saying the store number is wrong, and Im
sorry but thats... (notices a fire that Rosss candle has started) Oh my God!!
Ross  (putting out the fire with a squeeze bottle of water) Okay, thats a
fire. Oh yeah. Oh yeah.
Rachel  (on phone) Excuse me, Im sorry, Im gonna have to call you
back, Ive got a Schemp in my office. (hangs up) (to Ross) What are you doing?
Ross  Im sorry. But ah, hey, oh, somebodys off the phone, how
bout a glass of wine by the fire, I could get it going again.
Rachel  Ross youre not listening to me, I dont have time to stop.
Ross  Come on Rach, you dont have what, ten minutes?
Rachel  I dont have ten minutes!!
Ross  What? (to Sophie) Sophie, does she have ten minutes?
Rachel  Hey, Ross!!! I told you I dont!
Ross  Dont yell at me okay, this is the most Ive seen you all week.
Rachel  Look, I cannot do this right now, okay, Ive got a deadline, would
you just go home, Ill talk to you later. (storms out)
Ross  Yeah, but wait...
Rachel  Good bye!
Sophie  Actually, thats our three hole punch.
[Scene  Monica and Rachel's, Ross is eating the picnic as Rachel comes home from work.]
Ross  Hey.
Rachel  Hi. Look um, about what happened earlier...
Ross  No, hey, well, I-I completely understand. You were, you were stressed.
Rachel  (throws her stuff down) I was gonna give you a chance to apologise to
me.
Ross  For what? For letting you throw me out of your office?
Rachel  You had no right coming down to my office Ross. You do not bring
a picnic basket to somebodys work! Unless maybe they were a park ranger!
Ross  Yeah, well excuse me for wanting to be with my girlfriend on our
anniversary, boy what an ass am I.
Rachel  But I told you, I didnt have the time!
Ross  Yeah, well you never have the time. I mean, I dont feel like I even
have a girlfriend anymore, Rachel.
Rachel  Wh, Ross what do you want from me? You want me, you want me to quit my
job so you can feel like you have a girlfriend?
Ross  No, but itd be nice if you realised, its just a job!
Rachel  Just a job!
Ross  Yes.
Rachel  Ross do you realise this is the first time in my life Im doing
something I actually care about. This is the first time in my life Im doing
something that Im actually good at. I mean. if you dont get that...
Ross  No, hey, I get that, okay, I get that big time. And Im happy for ya,
but Im tired of having a relationship with your answering machine! Okay, I
dont know what to do anymore.
Rachel  Well neither do I!
Ross  Is this about Mark?
Rachel  (shocked) Oh my God.
Ross  Okay, its not, its not.
Rachel  Oh my God. I cannot keep having this same fight over and over again,
Ross, no, youre, youre, youre making this too hard.
Ross  Oh Im, Im making this too hard. Okay, what do you want me to
do.
Rachel  I dont know, I dont know. Urrrgh! Look, maybe we should take
a break.
Ross  Okay, okay, fine, youre right. Lets ah, lets take a
break, (goes to the door) lets cool off, okay, lets get some frozen yogart, or
something.. (opens the door)
Rachel  No. (Ross is standing in the doorway.) A break from us.
[Scene  The Philly, Chandler and Joey are talking to Chloe.]
Chloe  And the advances in collating in the past five years, I mean we just got
in an X-5000, y'know. The X-5000 makes the X-50 look like a T-71.
Chloe  (seeing Ross enter) Hey, its the dinosaur guy. (runs over to Ross)
Hi, Ross.
Ross  Oh, hi Chloe.
Chloe  I want you to met some friends of mine. (Introduces him to Chandler and
Joey) This guy is my hero, he comes in with some stuff he wants it blown up 400%, we said
we dont do that, and he says you gotta. And y'know what, we did it. And now anytime
anybody wants 400, we just say lets Ross it!
Chandler  And thats the only colour that comes in.
Issac  Yo, Chloe, do you have a quarter for the condom machine?
Chloe  Oh! (storms off)
Chandler  So, what are you doing here? I thought tonight was your big
anniversary dinner.
Ross  Yeah, little change in plans. Ahh, were gonna break-up instead.
[Scene  A Restaurant, Monica and Phoebe are on their dates with Sergei and Mischa.]
Monica  Oh, and I can also speak a little French. Voulez-vous coucher avec moi
ce soir? (Mischa laughs) Why? What did I say?
Mischa  Well, you just asked if I wanted to go to bed with you tonight.
Monica  Oh my God! No wonder I get such great service at Cafe Maurice.
Phoebe  (laughing and banging her spoon on the table) Knock, knock, knock,
knock, hi. Um, could you please tell Sergei that um, I was fascinated by what Boutros
Boutros Gali said in the New York Times.
Phoebe  You didnt say Boutros Boutros Gali.
Mischa  (to Sergei) Boutros Boutros Gali.
Mischa  He says he was too.
Phoebe  Interesting.
Mischa  (to Monica) So I was wondering....
Phoebe  Okay, ah, before you get all talky again, umm, could you also please
tell Sergei that I really like his suit.
Mischa  (to Phoebe, very quickly) Eh, he said, thank you very much, he thinks
you look very pretty tonight, your hair, golden like the sun. (to Monica) So you're a
chef?
Monica  Im also thinking about opening up my own restaurant.
Mischa  Oh, really.
Phoebe  Monica, can I talk to you behind my menu, please. (Behind the menu) What
are you doing?
Monica  Well, I was having a conversation.
Phoebe  Yeah but, Mischa is so interested in you, that Sergei and I havent
been able to say two words to each other.
Monica  What do you want me to do? Just sit here silently while you three have a
conversation?
Phoebe  That would be great. Thank you.
[Scene  Monica and Rachel's, Rachel is lying in front of the bay window, and the phone
rings.]
Rachel  (jumping up to answer the phone) Hello!
Mark  Oh, hi. Its Mark.
Rachel  (disappointed) Oh.
Mark  What? Is it my breath?
Rachel  No! Sorry, I just thought you were somebody else. Hi!
Mark  Hi. Well, look, I was just gonna leave a message, isnt tonight your,
your big anniversary dinner?
Rachel  Yeah. Well, umm.....
Mark  Rach, are you okay?
Rachel  (on the verge of tears) Yeah, Im fine.
Mark  You wanna talk, I mean I can come over?
Rachel  No! Really, no, please, please, thats, thats okay.
Mark  All right, all right, Im coming over, and Im bringing Chinese
food.
Rachel  Oh, yeah, Im not, Im not hungry.
Mark  Its for me.
Rachel  Oh. Okay, bye.
[Scene  The Philly.]
Joey  So what are you gonna do?
Ross  What can I do? One person wants to break-up, you break-up.
Chandler  Hey, no way! Come on, this is you guys, call her and work it out.
Ross  Oh come on, we just had this huge fight, all right, dont I have to
wait a while?
Chandler  Hey, this isnt like swimming after you eat, pick up the phone!!
Chandler  Y'know that whole swimming thing is a myth.
Joey  Yeah, tell that to my Uncle Lenny.
Chandler  Why? What happened to him?
Joey  Nothing, hes just really believes in that.
[Scene  Monica and Rachel's, Mark is there, opening Chinese food boxes.]
Rachel  Oh, and then, we got into this big, stupid fight. I just, it was awful.
I told him he treats me like a park ranger, or something, oh and then I told him I wanted
to take a break, I dont want to take a break.
Mark  Wow. Im sorry. Eggroll?
Rachel  No. (grabs an eggroll) And then I called him, and he wasnt there.
Mark  Well, then hes, hes probably just, out.
Rachel  Oh, thank you thats very helpful, Im glad you came over.
Rachel  Hello.
Ross  Hi! Its me.
Rachel  Hi! Oh, Im so glad you called.
Ross  Really? Ive been thinking, this is crazy, I mean dont,
dont you think we can work on this?
Mark  Hey, what do you want to drink?
Ross  Whos that?
Rachel  Nobody.
Mark  Is it okay if I finish the apple juice?
Ross  Is that Mark?
Rachel  Umm, honey, look he just came over to....
Ross  Yeah! Got it! (slams the phone down, and walks back to the bar.)
Chloe  Hey, dinosaur guy, look at you, so sad. Come dance.
Ross  Ah, thats okay, thanks.
Chloe  Hey, you dont have to smile. You just have to dance.
Ross  Look, I dont feel like dancing, I feel like having a drink. Okay?
Chloe  Oh, okay. (to the bartender) Hey, two beers. (sits down next to him)
[Scene  The Restaurant, after dinner.]
Mischa  (to Monica) And the vet said it was time. And so from half a world away,
while my Mother held the phone to his ear, I said good bye to my dog,. In seven languages.
Monica  Oh. (to Phoebe) Can I have a tissue?
Phoebe  Oh, yeah, sure. I just hope you, hope you dont accidentally suck
it up through your nose and choke on it.
Mischa  (to Phoebe) Sergei, would like to apologise for my behaviour tonight.
Phoebe  Well, tell him, apology accepted.
Mischa  (to Monica) Oh, hes unbelievable. I mean for the first time in
three years somebody wants to actually want to talk to me, but do you think he would let
me enjoy that, no!! (to Sergei) You silly diplomat, why dont you learn some English,
Sergei?
Phoebe  Excuse me, but umm, isnt he paying for your dinner?
Monica  Hey, the mans dog just died.
Mischa  (to Monica) I have just resigned my post. Would you care to accompany me
to the Rainbow Room? I have diplomatic coupons.
Monica  It will be my pleasure. (to Phoebe) My guy has diplomatic coupons. Your
guy cant even say coupons. (they leave)
Sergei  Uh, (picks up a plate) plate?
Phoebe  Plate! Yes, plate.
Sergei  Plate. Plate. Plate.
Phoebe  See, we dont need them.
Sergei  (picking up a cup) Plate?
Phoebe  Yeah.
[Scene  The Philly, With or Without You is playing. (Which is the same song Ross
played for Rachel in TOW the List.)]
Ross  (to Chloe) I like this song.
Chloe  Well, youre practically dancing already. Why dont you just do
it over here?
Ross  Oh, no, no.
Chloe  What? Are you married? Cause thats okay.
[Scene  Monica and Rachel's, Rachel is next to the bay window again, Mark has left.]
Rachel  (picks up the phone and calls Ross) Oh, be home, be home, be home, be
home, be home, be home. Be home. Be home, be home, be home. Oh, youre not home.
[Scene  The Philly, Ross is dancing with Chloe.]
Chloe  Still no smile?
[Scene  Central Perk, Sergei is teaching Phoebe how to sing American Pie, by Don
Maclean.]
Sergei  (singing) Touchet, touchet, Miss Americccan pie. (stops to correct
Phoebe) Ameri-ccan.
Phoebe  Ameri-can.
Sergei  Ameri-ccan.
Phoebe  Ameri-can. Y'know its a very hard language. Lets do
it again.
Sergei  (to the rest of Central Perk) Everybody!! (In his language, and
continues.)
Joey  (Voice Over) Previously on Friends.
[Scene  Monica and Rachel's, Ross is eating the picnic as Rachel comes home from work.]
Ross  I mean, I dont feel like I even have a girlfriend anymore.
Rachel  You want me to just quit my job so that you can feel like youve
got a girlfriend?
Ross  Is this about Mark?
Rachel  (shocked) Oh my God.
Ross  Okay, its not, its not.
Rachel  Oh my God. I cannot keep having this same fight with you Ross! Look,
urrgh, maybe we should take a break.
Ross  Fine, youre right. Lets ah, lets take a break, (goes to
the door) lets cool off, okay, lets get some frozen yoghurt, or something..
(opens the door)
Rachel  No. A break from us.
[Scene  Monica and Rachel's, Mark is there, opening Chinese food boxes.]
Rachel  Then, we had this big, stupid fight, and I said I wanted to take a
break, I dont want to take a break.
Ross  (on the phone) Ive been thinking, this is crazy, I mean dont,
dont you think we can work on this?
Mark  Hey, what do you want to drink?
Ross  Whos that?
Rachel  Nobody.
Ross  Is that Mark?
Rachel  Umm, honey, look he just came over to....
Ross  Yeah! Got it! (slams down the phone)
[Scene  The Philly.]
Chloe  Hey, come dance. What? Are you married? Cause thats okay.
[Scene  Monica and Rachel's, Monica is making a fruit drink in the blender, Rachel has
just finished her shower and is coming out of the bathroom.]
Monica  Hey.
Rachel  Hey.
Monica  Hows the big anniversary dinner?
Rachel  Well, we never actually got to dinner.
Monica  Ohhh, nice.
Rachel  No, we kinda broke up instead.
Monica  What?! (She accidentally starts the blender without the lid on it and
fruit flies everywhere.)
Rachel  (looking up at the ceiling) God, Monica its on the ceiling.
Monica  Thats okay, this is more important than fruit (pause) (angrily) on
my ceiling! You broke up?!
Rachel  Yeah, but its okay, because when Ross left Mark came over.
Monica  Oh no!!
Rachel  No.
Monica  Rachel, you and Mark?!
Rachel  No, no-no, its okay, calm down. Mark and I talked, and I realised
how much I love your stupid brother, and, yeah, we got our problems, but I really want to
make it work.
[Scene  Rosss Bedroom, Ross is waking up. He straightens himself out on the bed
and puts the covers over his head.]
Chloe  (entering from bathroom) Morning!
[Scene  Rosss Kitchen, Ross is taking some aspirin and checking his messages.]
Rachel  (on answering machine) Hi, its me. Ive been trying to reach
you all night. I feel awful. Please, Ross, you gotta know there is nothing between me and
Mark. This whole break-up thing is just stupid.
Ross  Yeah!!
Rachel  Eh, Im just so sorry I put you through it. And, I y'know, I
dont want to get back together over a machine.
Ross  Na-huh.
Rachel  So, I love you.
Ross  I love you.
Ross  Okay. (Ross starts frantically looking for a clock.)
Rachel  Bye.
(Ross finds a clock, sees its almost 8 30, and silently screams.)
Ross  Chloe, Chloe hows it coming?!!
Chloe  (entering from bedroom) Hey, what kind of puppy do you think I should
get?
Ross  Umm, oh, hey, I dont know. How about a big one?
Chloe  But my apartment is so...
Ross  Well then a small one!! Listen, lets, we kinda have to get going!
Chloe  Wait! Wheres my shoes?
Ross  You, you sure you need shoes? (Chloe nods her head) Okay. (reaches down
and picks up a shoe)
Chloe  Do I know why were rushing?
Ross  Yeah, y'know the ah, the girlfriend I told you about last night?
(Hes frantically throwing the cushions off of the couch looking for her other shoe)
Well it turns out she ah, she wants to get back together with me. Oh, I found it!!
Chloe  Thats so great for you guys!
Ross  Yeah!
Chloe  You must be so happy!
Ross  Yes, yes I am, one of the many things Im feeling. Well.... (picks up
her coat)
Chloe  Good luck, with your girlfriend.
Ross  Oh, thank you. (She goes to kiss him, but he holds her coat up between
their faces to stop her.) Hey, hey. (opens the door, sees Rachel, and hides Chloe behind
the door) Rachel!!!!
Rachel  Hi. Ohhh, you got my message.
Ross  Yeah, oh hey, you are right on time.
Rachel  So what do you say? Can I be your girlfriend again?
Ross  Yes, you can, very much.
Ross  (seeing the thumbs up) Ahhhh!! (Hugs Rachel tighter.)
[Scene  Monica and Rachel's, Phoebe is entering carry a large box, Monica is mopping
the ceiling.]
Phoebe  Hey!
Monica  Hey.
Phoebe  Hey, why are you mopping your ceiling?
Monica  Oh, theres banana on it.
Phoebe  Wow, I have the spirit of an old Indian women living in mine.
Monica  So then you know? (Phoebe nods her head)
Phoebe  The mailman was downstairs, so I brought up your mail.
Monica  Oh, good. Thanks.
Phoebe  Now what is Fabutec?
Monica  Okay, all right dont judge me to much. Okay? Um, but I saw this
info-mercial, and um, I swear to you I have never-ever bought anything on TV before,
except for this mop. But there was this stuff on leg waxing, it just, it looked so
amazing....
Phoebe  Waxine!!
Monica  Yes! Have you seen it?
Phoebe  Oh, its incredible! I so want to be a Waxine girl.
Monica  I know!!
Phoebe  God. Do think it really doesnt hurt? Cause how can they do
that?
Monica  Hello! Organic substances recently discovered in the depths of the rain
forest!
Phoebe  They have the best stuff in there.
[Scene  Chandler and Joey's, Ross has told Chandler and Joey his terrible act.]
Chandler  Oh my God! Oh my God!
Joey  Yeah. We figured when we couldnt find you, youd gone home to
make up with Rachel. Which is probably what you shoulda done. Huh?
Ross  You think?! God, I, ah, Im in hell. I mean what, what am I gonna do?
Rachels all like, I love you and, and lets work on this. And all I
can think about is, What is she gonna do? What is she gonna say? when I tell
her what I did.
Chandler  Well, before we answer that, I think we should address the more
important question. How dumb are you?
Ross  What?! Look, were trying to rebuild a relationship here, right. How
am I supposed to do that here, without being totally honest with each other?
Joey  Look, Ross look, Im on board about this totally honesty thing, I am,
just not about stuff thats gonna get you in trouble.
Chandler  Hes right. Nobodys gonna benefit, and youre just
gonna hurt her.
Joey  Yeah, and there wont be a relationship left to rebuild.
Ross  Yeah, but dont you think....
Chandler  All right look, if you absolutely have to tell her, at least wait
until the timings right. And thats what deathbeds are for.
Ross  Yeah, okay. (he plops down into one of the leather chairs, with the
footrest extended.)
Joey  All right, okay, now, we just have to make sure she doesnt find out
some other way. (spins the chair around so that Ross is facing him) Did you think about
the trail?
Ross  What trail?
Joey  (stomps on the footrest which pops Ross up into a sitting position) The
trail from the woman you did it with to the woman you hope never finds out who did it!
(slapping his hands with each word) You always have to think about the trail!
Ross  Oh, I-I dont think theres any trail.
Chandler  Okay, okay-okay, ah, Chloe works with that guy Issac. Issacs
sister is Jasmine. And Jasmine works at that message place with Phoebe. And Phoebes
friends with Rachel. And thats the trail, I did it!
[Scene  Monica's Bedroom, Monica and Phoebe are waxing their legs.]
Phoebe  (reading from the instructions) After applying the Waxine and linen
strips to leg number one,
Monica  Did that!
Phoebe  Grasp one of the linen strips by its easy grab tab and pull
it off in one quick pain free motion.
Monica  Okay. (Does so.) Ow!!!!! Ow-oh-oh!
Phoebe  Was it not pain-free?
Monica  No. It was painful. Oh my God , they should call it Pain-zine, now with
a little wax.
Phoebe  Huh, well, the girls in the satin nighties on the commercial dont
seem to think its that bad.
Monica  Thats because their nerves are probably deadened from being so
stupid. But hey, y'know if you dont believe me, please, by my guest.
Phoebe  (Removing one of the strips) Ow-ow-ow-ow! Oh my God!!!
Monica  Now, are you glad we didnt start with the bikini strips?
[Scene  The Xerox Place, Ross is trying to break the trail.]
Ross  (entering) Chloe? Hi..
Chloe  Is this about me taking your watch?
Ross  You took my watch?
Chloe  Im sorry, I do that.
Ross  Just you keep it, listen did you, did you tell anyone about us?
Chloe  Oh no. I feel it isnt really anybodys business, y'know.
Ross  Exactly. So you didnt, didnt mention anything to Issac right?
Chloe  Oh, well I tell Issac everything.
Ross  You tell, of course you do. Issac. Issac. Hey, Issac. Issac, hi! Y'know we
havent actually met...
Issac  You dog!
Ross  Yes, I suppose I am a dog. But Issac, see I-I happen to have a girlfriend.
Issac  Oh right, that Rachel chick from the coffee place.
Ross  Yeah, thats the one. Listen, I dont want to hurt her.
Issac  Oh, hey, man I know, doesnt matter how much we love em,
monogamy is too cruel a rule.
Ross  Yeah. Listen, can you keep this information to yourself?
Issac  Aw, no problem dude. Y'know we got to look out for each other. Were
the same, you and me.
Ross  Actually, no, were not.
Issac  Yeah, we are.
Ross  No, were not.
Issac  Yeah, we are.
Ross  No, were not!!
Issac  Okay, were not.
Ross  Right.
Issac  But, we are.
Ross  Fine. I just need to know that youre not gonna tell your sister.
Issac  I can promise not to tell her again.
[Scene  Phoebes Work, Ross is now trying to stop Jasmine from telling Phoebe.]
Ross  (entering out of breath) Jasmine?
Jasmine  Uh-huh.
Ross  We met at Phoebes birthday party, Im, Im Ross Geller.
Jasmine  You did a bad thing!
Ross  Yes, I did.
Jasmine  Very bad!
Ross  Very bad.
Jasmine  Very, very bad.
Ross  Im agreeing with you. Did you, listen, did you happen to tell Phoebe
yet?
Jasmine  No.
Ross  Okay, Jasmine, please, please dont. I love my girlfriend very much,
and I want more than anything to just work it out with her. Okay?
Jasmine  All right.
Ross  Thank you, thank you.
Jasmine  But you should probably talk to my roommate, because I told him and he
knows Phoebe too.
Ross  (angrily) Whos your roommate?
[Scene  Central Perk, Gunther is wiping down the counter as Ross rushes in.]
Ross  Gunther! Gunther. Gunther, please tell me you didnt say anything to
Rachel about me and the girl from the Xerox place.
Gunther  Im sorry. Was I not supposed to?
[Scene  Monicas Bedroom, Monica and Phoebe are removing the rest of their wax
strips.]
Monica  Ow!
Phoebe  Oh!!
Monica  Ow!! Ow!!
Phoebe  Ow!!!
Monica and Phoebe  Ow!!!!!!! Ow-ow-ow-ow!
Phoebe  Were all right.
Monica  Its okay, its okay.
Phoebe  Were all right.
Monica  We were just waxing our legs.
Chandler  Off?!!
Phoebe  For your information, this happens to be a pain like no man will ever
experience.
Chandler  Yeah, well I dont think you can make that statement, unless
youve been kicked in an area that God only meant to be treated nicely.
Joey  Yeah, I-I think that women just have a lower threshold of pain than men,
thats all. I mean, come on, its just a little wax.
Phoebe  Oh yeah, come here. (Puts a little wax on Joeys arm and puts a
strip on it.)
Chandler  Oh, thats mature.
Joey  Okay, fine, so now what, I just pull it off?
Phoebe  Uh-huh.
Monica  Thats right.
Ross  (forcing the door open) Come on, Rachel, come on! Talk to me! Please!!
Rachel  I cant talk to you. I cant even look at you right now!
Monica  What?
Chandler  Nothing, nothing.
Monica  (going over to listen at the door) Rachel said everything was okay.
Phoebe  (to Joey) What, what are they talking about?
Ross  Rachel?
Rachel  Just get away from me!
Ross  No, it was a mistake! I made a mistake! Okay?
Rachel  A mistake?! What were you trying to put it in? Her purse?!
Phoebe  Whe-where did he put it?!
Rachel  Ross, you had sex with another woman!
Monica  Oh my God.
Phoebe  Oh, I knew something had to be wrong, because my fingernails did not
grow at all yesterday.
Chandler  Yeah, well, I guess they had a fight, and he got drunk....
Monica  Oh!! (hits Chandler and Joey in the head) You guys knew about this and
you didnt tell us?!
Chandler  (to Joey) He has sex, and we get hit in our heads.
Rachel  (opening the door) Y'know what, I want you to leave! Get outta here!
Ross  No!!
Rachel  Just get out! Now!!
Ross  No!! No!! I wanna stay. I wanna talk about this.
Rachel  Okay! All right! How was she?
Chandler  Uh-oh.
Ross  What?
Rachel  Was she good?
Joey  Dont answer that.
Rachel  Come on Ross! You said you wanted to talk about it, lets talk
about it!! How was she?
Ross  She was...
Joey  Awful! Horrible!
Chandler  She was not good. Not good.
Joey  She was nothing compared to you.
Ross  She, she was different.
Joey  Ewwwww!
Chandler  Uh-oh.
Rachel  Good different?
Ross  Nobody likes change.
Ross  What? Okay, okay, okay, okay.
Phoebe  Should we do something?
Chandler  Yeah, never cheat on Rachel.
Ross  Im sorry, okay, Im sorry. I wa-I was disgusted with myself,
and this morning I was so, I was so upset and then I got your message and I was so happy,
and all I wanted was to get her out of my apartment as fast as possible.
Rachel  Whoa!! Whoa, whoa, wait a minute. What time did your little friend
leave? (Ross cant answer that) Oh my God. She was there? She was still there? She
was in there, when I was in there?!
Ross  Listen. Oh hey, hey, the important thing was that she meant, she meant
nothing to me!
Rachel  And yet she was worth jeopardising our relationship!!
Ross  Look, I didnt think there was a relationship to jeopardise. I
thought we were broken up.
Rachel  We were on a break!
Ross  That, for all I knew would, could last forever. That to me is a break-up.
Rachel  You think youre gonna get out of this on a technicality?
Ross  Look, Im not trying to get out of anything, okay. I thought our
relationship was dead!
Rachel  Well, you sure had a hell of a time at the wake!
Joey  Y'know what, I dont think we should listen to this anymore. (Goes to
open the door)
Monica  (stopping him) What, what are you doing? You cant go out there.
Joey  Why not?! (to Chandler) Im hungry.
Monica  Because theyll know weve been listening.
Rachel  God! And to have to hear about it from Gunther!!
Ross  Come on! Like I wanted him to tell you, I ran all over the place trying to
make sure that didnt happen!
Rachel  Oh, that is so sweet. I think Im falling in love with you all over
again.
Chandler  Y'know what, I think we can go out there. I mean they have more
important things to worry about.
Joey  Yeah, well be fine.
Ross  Look Rachel, I wanted to tell you, I thought I should, I-I did, and then
Chandler and Joey convinced me not to.
Chandler  (handing Monica the wax) Wax the door shut, were never leaving,
ever.
Phoebe  Hi, its Phoebe. Listen someones gonna have to take my 900
with Mr. Rehack, cause its like 9
Ross  Dont you realise none of this wouldve ever happened if I
didnt think at that same moment you werent having sex with Mark?
Rachel  All right. Lets say I had slept with Mark. Would you have been
able to forgive me?
Ross  (pause) Yes I would.
Rachel  Youd be okay if you knew that Mark had kissed me, and been naked
with me, and made love to me?
Ross  (less sure) Yes.
Rachel  You knew that our hot, sweaty, writhing bodies were....
Ross  (covering his ears and screaming) La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la! Okay,
okay, yeah, I would have been devastated but, I would still want to be with you. Because
its, I mean its you.
All  Ohhhhh!
Ross  What? Come on Rach, tell me what youre thinking?
Rachel  Im thinking, Im gonna order a pizza.
Ross  Order a pizza like, I forgive you?
Joey  Oh man, pizza? I like pizza. (makes like he is trying to send a telepathic
message to Rachel) Put olives on the pizza.
Phoebe  We could eat the wax! Its organic.
Chandler  Oh great, food with hair on it.
Phoebe  No, not the used wax.
Chandler  Because that would be crazy?
Ross  Hey, can I, can I get in on that? Because Im kinda hungry myself.
Rachel  Fine. (on phone) Hi! Yes, Id like to order a large pizza.
Ross  No anchovies.
Rachel  With ah, extra anchovies.
Ross  Thats okay, Ill just pick em off.
Rachel  Yeah, and could you please chop some up and just put it right there in
the sauce?
Ross  You can have the last piece, if you want.
Rachel  Well, I should think so. You slept with someone.
[Cut to Monica's bedroom, theyre all eating the wax, Chandler and Phoebe,
dont like it. Joey tries some and makes a face like  Hey, thats not so
bad.]
Phoebe  Theyre gonna get through this, arent they?
Chandler  Yeah, come on, its Ross and Rachel, theyve got too.
Monica  What if they dont?
Joey  You think I need a new walk?
Chandler  What?
Joey  Well y'know, Ive been walking the same way since high school.
Y'know, y'know how some guys they walk into a room and everybody takes notice. I think I
need a take notice walk.
Chandler  Are you actually saying these words?
Ross  What, now youre not even taking to me? (moves over to the coffee
table) Look Rachel, I-Im sorry, okay, Im sorry, I was out of my mind. I
thought Id lost you, I didnt know what to do. Come on! Come on, how insane
must I have been to do something like this? Huh? I-I dont cheat right, I,
thats not me, Im not Joey!
Joey  Whoa-ho-ho! (He looks at Chandler, who gives him a come on
look.) Yeah, okay.
Monica  Hey. Its three in the morning. They dont know that Ive
come home yet. You notice how neither one of them are wondering where I am.
Phoebe  Yeah, y'know, people can be so self-involved.
Ross  Y'know what, y'know what, Im-Im not the one that wanted that,
that break, okay. Youre the one that bailed on us. Youre the one that, that
ran when things got just a little rough!
Rachel  Thats....
Ross  Thats what?!
Rachel  That is neither here nor there.
Ross  Okay, well here we are. Now were in a tough spot again, Rach. What
do you want to do? How do you want to handle it? Huh? Do you wanna fight for us? Or, do
you wanna bail? (sits down next to her) Look, I, (on the verge of tears) I did a terrible,
stupid, stupid thing. Okay? And Im sorry, I wish I could take it back, but I
cant. (We see Monica and Phoebe are almost in tears.) I just cant see us
throwing away something we know is so damn good. Rachel, I love you so much.
Rachel  No Ross!! (stands up and moves away from him) Dont! You cant
just kiss me and think youre gonna make it all go away, okay? It doesnt work
that way. It doesnt just make it better. Okay?
Ross  Okay, okay, okay.
Rachel  (softly) I think you should go.
Ross  What?
Rachel  (softly) I really think you need to go now.
Ross  (moving over to stand in front of her) Okay, okay. This morning you said
there was nothing so big that we couldnt work past it together...
Rachel  Yeah, what the hell did I know!
Ross  Look, look, theres got to be a way we can work past this. Okay,
(takes a hold of one of her arms.) I cant imagine, I cant imagine my life
without you. (Both of them are starting to cry.) Without, without these arms, and your
face, and this heart. Your good heart Rach, (drops to his knees and hugs her around her
waist) and, and....
Rachel  (crying) No. I cant, youre a totally different person to me
now. I used to think of you as somebody that would never, ever hurt me, ever. God, and now
I just cant stop picturing with her, I cant, (Ross stands up and backs away)
it doesnt matter what you say, or what you do, Ross. Its just changed,
everything. Forever.
Ross  (crying) Yeah, but this cant be it, I mean.
Rachel  Then how come it is?
[Scene  Monicas bedroom.]
Phoebe  Theyve been quiet for a long time.
Joey  Maybe she killed him?
Chandler  Lets go.
Chandler  (to Joey) Is that your new walk?
Joey  (whispering) No, I really have to pee.
[Scene  Central Perk, Chandler and Joey are sitting on the couch reading.]
Joey  Can I see the comics?
Chandler  This is the New York Times.
Joey  Okay, may I see the comics?
Monica  Guys. I thought you were taking Ross to the game?
Chandler  We are. Hes meeting us here.
Monica  No! Rachel is meeting us here.
Phoebe  Oh come on, they can be in the same room.
Joey  Yeah, you shoulda been there last night.
Phoebe  Why? What happened now?
Joey  Well Ross was hangin out over at our place, Rachel comes over to
borrow some moisturiser from Chandler....
Chandler  Yeah y-you, how hard is it to say something? Rachel came over to
borrow something.
Joey  Anyway! Her and Ross just started yelling at each other.
Phoebe  Wait. Why was he yelling at her? Hes the one who slept with
someone else.
Joey  Well, I guess he says that because they were on a break when it happened,
that she should of forgiven him by now.
Phoebe  Whoa!! He is soo unreasonable! God, although I think I understand what
he means. Oh my God, this is like 60 Minutes, okay, when, when, at first
youre really mad at that pharmaceutical company for making the drug and then y'know
you just feel bad for the people because they needed to make their hair grow.
Chandler  Y'know what this is like? This is like when my parents got divorced.
Man, I hope Ross doesnt try to kidnap me after Cub Scouts.
Phoebe  Y'know I had a dream where Ross and Rachel were still together, they
never broke up. And we were all just like hanging out, and everyone was happy....
Joey  I had the same dream!
Phoebe  Yeah, and nobody slept with that Xerox girl.
Joey  Oh, I had the opposite dream.
Chandler  Y'know what maybe its gonna be okay, I mean its been a
week.
Joey  Yeah, I mean its never taken me a week to get over a relationship.
Monica  Its never taken you more than a shower to get over a
relationship.
Monica  (seeing her) Okay, lets go!! Lets hit the road!!
Rachel  Hey!
Monica  Lets get the show on it!
Rachel  Okay, let me just get a cup of coffee.
Monica  Oh Rachel, I know the best coffee house and its sooo close.
Rachel  Closer than here?
Phoebe  (turning around and picking a cup off of a table) Oh, hey, look, I found
coffee! (handing her the cup) Okay, lets skedaddle.
Rachel  Wait, Im not just gonna drink somebodys old coffee.
Phoebe  Okay, your highness.
Phoebe  (in a deep voice, imitating Ross) Um, Rachel Im really sorry.
(imitating Rachel) Thats okay, do you wanna get back together? (imitating Ross)
Yeah, okay. (in her normal voice) Did anyone else hear that?!
[Scene  Chandler and Joey's, the whole gang is there, except for Ross and Rachel. Joey
is trying to eat Chinese with chopsticks and fails miserably. Theres a knock on the
door, and Chandler answers it to reveal Rachel]
Rachel  (softly) Is he here?
Chandler  No.
Rachel  Oh. (smiles) Heres your moisturiser. Hi!
Monica and Phoebe  Hey!
Rachel  You guys are gonna love meee! Okay, check it out, Thursday night, five
tickets, Calvin Klein lingerie show, and you guys are coming with me. (theyre
all silent and look away) Okay, I said that out loud right?
Chandler  Yes, yes, its just that we ah, we kinda all ready, made plans
with Ross.
Rachel  Oh, well okay. Well, there you go.
Phoebe  No, its just that he got this new like home theater dealie, and he
wants y'know, us to check it out.
Rachel  Hm-mm.
Chandler  Yeah, hes really excited about it too, he even recorded show
times on his answering machine.
Rachel  Ohh!
Monica  Were sorry honey.
Rachel  Oh, its okay. (starts to leave)
Joey  Rach, its, its ah, its not that we dont want to,
really. (quietly) Are we talking models in their underwear?
Rachel  And heels.
Joey  (He turns around to Chandler looking for approval to go with Rachel,
Chandler mouths Come on!) (turning back to Rachel) Ross, did ask us first, and
we set that night aside.
Rachel  No, hey, come on, if he asked you first, thats only fair. (leaves)
Phoebe  Ohhh boy, do I feel bad.
Joey  Oh yeah.
Monica  Very bad.
Phoebe  Chandler what are you doing?!
Monica  Chandler!!
Chandler  (jumps back and points at the cigarette) Oh my God!
Joey  Youre smoking again?!
Chandler  Well, actually, yesterday I was smoking again. Today, Im,
Im smoking still.
Phoebe  Why would you start again after chewing all that quitting gum?
Chandler  Look, Im telling you this is just like my parents divorce, which
is when I started smoking in the first place.
Monica  Werent you nine?!
Chandler  Yeahhh. Im tellin ya something, that ah, first smoke after
nap time....
Chandler  Oh thats great, with my luck, thats gonna be him.
Phoebe  Him? Him, Ross?
Chandler  Nope, hymn 253, His Eyes Are On The Sparrow! When my parents got
divorced is when I started using humour as a defence mechanism. (answers the door and
its Rachel again.)
Rachel  Hi! Uhh, do you guys have plans for the weekend? Because I have my
sister on hold, and she said that we could use her cabin for the weekend and go skiing.
Huh? Im asking you first, right?!. I mean Im playing by the rules.
All  Absolutely, yeah!
Rachel  Chandler! Youre smoking? What are you doing?!
Chandler  Hey, shut up!! Youre not my real Mom!!
[Scene  Rosss, the gang, minus Rachel of course, is there. Chandler is forced to
smoke by an open window.]
Joey  (obviously cold) Hey, can you close that window Chandler? My nipples can
cut glass over here!
Phoebe  Wait. Really?! Cause mine get me out of tickets.
Ross  Look, you guys I just wanna say, I really, really appreciate you spending
this time with me. Its been a pretty hard time right now, so I just wanna say
thanks.
Chandler  Can somebody else hug him? I have to stay by the window.
Ross  Oh hey, hey, huh, how about this weekend we have a laser disc marathon
okay, and maybe a tournament on my new dart board? Huh, huh, what do you think? (in an
Irish accent) Two days of darts, itll be great!
Joey  Itll be great for next weekend.
Ross  No, no, no, this weekend guys!
Joey  Itll be great for next weekend. I mean, (in an Irish accent)
itll be grrreat.
Ross  Whats going on?
Phoebe  Well, we were um, sorta invited to go skiing, y'know Rachels
sisters cabin. (Chandler goes back to the window to smoke again.)
Ross  So, for the whole weekend?
Monica  Were really sorry, but um, she did ask us first.
Ross  Yeah, thats okay, I mean if you guys all have to go away for
the first weekend Im alone by myself, y'know then I totally, totally understand.
Phoebe  Y'know what, I can stay, Im gonna stay. Cause the last time
I went skiing I was to afraid to jump off the chair lift, I just went around and around.
Joey  Uh, Pheebs we kinda need you to drive us all up there in your
grandmothers cab, but y'know what, Ill stay.
Monica  Noo! Ill stay. Hes my brother.
Ross  What a pity stay?
Monica  No! Were gonna have fun. We can make fudge!
Ross  Pity food? Y'know what thats okay, all right, I dont need any
of you to stay, okay nobody stays.
Chandler  Well, then, I might as well offer to stay.
[Scene  In Phoebes Grandmothers cab, driving up to the cabin. Phoebes
driving, Rachels sitting shotgun, Chandler, Monica, and Joey are in the back seat.]
Joey  (to Chandler and Monica) Hey, does anybody else feel bad about Ross?
Monica  Why? Do you think hes still mad at us?
Chandler  (to Joey) Well hes probably mad after you called him this
morning to borrow his goggles.
Joey  What? Mine arent tinted.
Phoebe  Chandler!!
Chandler  What?
Phoebe  What does the sign say?
Chandler  Beam me up Jesus.
Phoebe  No, the No Smoking sign. Theres no smoking in my
Grandmothers cab.
Chandler  Okay, well, then, I-I have to go to the bathroom.
All  Oh!
Phoebe  Please!
Monica  No Chandler no! No unscheduled stops. You can go when we stop for gas.
Chandler  Oh, come on, theres a rest stop right up there! Come on, I
really have to goooooooooo.
Joey  Oh, now I have to go!!
[Scene  The rest stop, Phoebes pulling in.]
Chandler  Here we go. Okay, brace yourselves.
Monica  What?
Rachel  Okay.
Monica  Ow!
Phoebe  (to Rachel, whos staying in the cab.) Arent you gonna go?
Rachel  No. Thank you.
Monica  (getting out) No, Rachel never pees in public restrooms.
Rachel  Well, they never have any paper in there y'know. So my rule is no
tissue, no tuschy. (Phoebe laughs and gets out.) Well, if everybodys going.
(She gets out and starts to close the door.)
Phoebe  No, y'know what dont close it (Rachel slams the door shut locking
themselves out.) cause the... keys...are in there.
Chandler  Oh, no-no-no-no-no-no!!
Joey  Whats going on?
Chandler  (to Joey) My lighters in there! (points to the cab)
[Scene  The rest stop, the gang is still stuck, Chandler is kneeling at the rear
bumper.]
Chandler  Damn! (stands up) The tailpipes not hot enough to light this!
Joey  Relax okay, I-I-I can get this open. Anybody have a coat hanger?
Chandler  Oh I do! Op, no, wait a minute, I took it out of my shirt when I put
it on this morning.
Monica  So, if youre parents hadnt got divorced, youd be able
to answer a question like a normal person?
Joey  Look, I just need a wire something to jimmy it. Oh hey, one of you guys
give me the underwire from your bra!
Monica  What?!
Rachel  What?!
Joey  Come on! Who has the biggest boobs?
Monica  Please!!
Joey  Whoever has the biggest boobs, has the biggest bra, therefore has the
biggest wire.
The Girls  No, not getting my bra!
Joey  If you wanna get back in the car, we need the wire, your call.
Phoebe  Okay, Monicas are the biggest.
Monica  These tiny, little non-breasts?! Please, its gotta be Rachel.
Rachel  What, no, no, no, mine are deceptively small I mean, I-I-I actually
sometimes, st-stuff my bra.
Monica  All right then, your bra would still be big.
Rachel  No, I stuff outside the bra.
Chandler  Ladies, ladies, lets just compromise okay? Phoebe, Rachel take
off Monicas bra.
Phoebe  All right, forget it, nevermind, you can have mine.
Rachel  (seeing him) Chandler, what are you doing? There is a trash can right
there.
Chandler  Well, I thought if I littered, that crying Indian might come by and
save us.
Phoebe  (finishing removing her bra) Okay, there.
Joey  Thank you Phoebe, that is very, very generous.
Chandler  Okay, now lets decide who has the nicest ass.
Joey  (opening the door) And there you go!
All  Oh, yeahhhhh!!!
Monica  Chandler!!
Chandler  At least let me smoke it to the good part.
Phoebe  Okay. (The car moves a few feet and sputters to a stop.) Oh, no!
Rachel  What, whats it, whats going on?
Phoebe  Yeah, this has happened before.
Rachel  So you know how to fix it?
Phoebe  Yep. Put more gas in.
[Scene  Carol and Susans, Carol is setting a romantic dinner for Susan as there
is a knock on the door.]
Carol  (answering the door) Hi!
Ross  (entering) Hey.
Carol  Hey, what are you doing here?
Ross  Well, oh just ah, I was just wondering, when you and I split up, did you
get the tape that was half the last episode of M*A*S*H and half the hostages
coming home?
Carol  Ah yeah, but now its Susan and me in Mexico and the hostages coming
home.
Ross  Wheres Ben?
Carol  Hes sleeping.
Ross  Ahh. (notices the table) Ooh, is this a ah, is this a bad time?
Carol  Umm, yeah, actually, Susans gonna be home any minute, its
kinda an anniversary.
Ross  Oh! I thought you guys got married in uh, January?
Carol  Its not that kind of anniversary.
Ross  Ah! (realises) Oh.
Carol  Sooo!! Anyway...
Ross  Umm, candles, champagne, yeah anniversaries are great. Cause you
know love lasts forever, y'know. Nothing like it in this lifetime, money in the bank, so
Rachel and I broke up.
Carol  Oh God, Ross I am so sorry.
Ross  Yeah, well.
Carol  Y'know what, I want to talk to you about this so much, but we should
probably do it when we could really get into it, are you free for dinner tomorrow night?
Ross  Oh yeah, Id love that.
Carol  Oh, great! Me too.
Ross  I guess it all started when Rachel got this new job. (he sits down at the
table.)
[Scene  The rest stop, Phoebe is on the phone to the motor club.]
Phoebe  Okay, yeah. (to Monica and Rachel) Triple A can pick us up.
Rachel  Great!
Phoebe  Yeah, what town are we near?
Monica  Freemont. West-Westmont, ah Westburg?
Phoebe  (to Monica) Then why are you answering? Do you at least know what route
were on?
Rachel  Yeah, we are definitely on Route 27.
Phoebe  Okay. (on phone) We are at a rest stop on Route 27. Okay. (to Rachel)
There is no Route 27. (listens) (to Rachel) Okay, either 93 or 76?
Rachel  I dont know, Im sorry, I always slept in the back when we
drove up here.
Phoebe  Okay. (on phone) Hey, can you send somebody up and down 76 and check
every rest stop, and, and also 93? (listens) Okay! (hangs up) Yeah, no they dont do
that.
Rachel  Ugh, okay, well somebody will come and save us.
Monica  Who? I mean have you seen a car come by here in the last hour and a
half? I think we should call Ross, maybe he can get a car and come pick us up.
Rachel  No! No, I am not getting in a car with Ross, we will just have to live
here!
Phoebe  But if...
Rachel  No you guys, I am not getting in a car with him, youll have to
think of something else.
Phoebe  Oh good, oh Joey and Chandler are back.
Monica  So the going for help went well?
Joey  Oh yeah, Smokey Joe here got half way to the highway and collapsed.
Chandler  I have the lung capacity of a two year old. (starts to light another
cigarette.)
Monica  Then why are you smoking?
Chandler  Well its very unsettling.
[Scene  Carol and Susans, Ross is eating the dinner Carol made for Susan.]
Ross  ....right? Right? I mean its pretty unbelievable y'know, I mean they
just took off, took off without even looking back. Y'know I dont, I dont need
them, huh, Ive got you guys now as friends, you and Susan.
Carol  Ah, Susan will be so pleased.
Ross  (looking at the page) 717? (to Carol) Wheres 717? (He gets up to
return the page, Carol starts to take the last of the food into the kitchen, but Ross
grabs the last piece.) Hey, youve have more of these for Susan right?
Carol  No. But its okay, Ill just put out pickles or something.
Phoebe  (answering the phone) (whispering) Ross, thank God.
Ross  Pheebs? What, why are you whispering?
Phoebe  I ate a bug.
Monica  (running over to stop Rachel) Hey Rach, the tampons here are only a
penny. Lets stock up. (takes her into the bathroom)
Phoebe  Listen Ross, we ran out of gas, and we dont know where we are, so
we cant get a tow truck.
Ross  Oh, now you want a favour?
Phoebe  Yes, please.
Ross  Well, oh, Im sorry your car broke down Pheebs, but Im a little
too busy with some of my real friends right now, but please call to let me know you got
home safely okay?
Carol  (running over and grabbing the phone away from Ross) (on phone) Phoebe,
hang on a second. (Hands Ross her keys) Here, take my car, go pick up your friends.
Ross  No, Im not gonna pick them up.
Carol  Listen, we both know youre gonna do it cause youre not
a jerk. Okay? So you can either sulk here for a half hour and then go pick them up, or
save us both time and sulk in the car.
Ross  No, Rachel doesnt want me to....
Carol  Look, I-I-I am sorry that Rachel dumped you cause she fell in love
with that Mark guy, and you are the innocent victim in all of this, but dont punish
your friends for what Rachel did to you.
Ross  Yeah, youre right.
Carol  (on phone) Phoebe hang on a second Ross wants to say something. (listens)
What? (listens) (to Ross) You slept with someone else?!
Ross  We were on a break!!! Okay!! (grabs the phone) We were, we were..., (calms
down) yeah. Where are you? Ill find you. (hangs up)
Carol  You slept with another woman?
Ross  Oh, you-youre-youre one to talk.
[Scene  The rest stop, Joey is making a sign.]
Joey  Okay, done.
Monica  (reading the sign) Whats pleh?
Joey  Thats help spelled backwards so that the helicopters can
read it from the air!
Monica  Huh. Whats doofus spelled backwards?
Rachel  (all excited) Op, op, car! Car!! (sees its Ross) Ugh!!!
Phoebe  Oh, its Ross on one of his drives!
Chandler and Joey  Hey!!
Phoebe  Hi!
Rachel  What is he doing here?!
Ross  He is saving your butt, ah, unless of course Im stepping on
some toes here, in which case I can just mosey on, Ive got plenty of people to help
on the Interstate.
All  No! Come on!
Rachel  All right!! Fine! Fine.
Joey  Arrrghh!!
Chandler  Oh no, now its not gonna make any sense!
Phoebe  (to Chandler and Monica) You guys, what, what do we do about Ross who
drove all the way up here? What do we do? Just like send him back and were then
gonna go skiing?
Chandler  Oh, this is horrible, its just horrible.
Joey  Guys, do you think we should ask Ross to come along?
Monica  I know, what about Rachel? I mean how are we even gonna ask her?
Rachel  Ask me what?
Monica  Umm, if ah, it might be okay if Ross came skiing?
Chandler, Phoebe, and Joey  No, I wasnt gonna ask you that, no.
Rachel  You guys are unbelievable. No! He cannot come.
Ross  Excuse me?
Chandler  Its horrible.
Ross  (sarcastic) Oh please, cant I come to your special, magical cabin?
Rachel  Why would you even want to come Ross? Youre a horrible skier.
Ross  Oh-oh, hitting me where it hurts, my ski skills.
Monica  Here we go again.
Joey  I-I cant handle this, you guys.
Chandler  Y'know what, I can handle it, handles my middle name. Actually
its the ah, middle part of my first name.
Ross  All right Pheebs, your cabs ready.
Rachel  All right, lets go!
Ross  Youre welcome.
Rachel  Oh, Im sorry, were you speaking to me or sleeping with someone
else?
Ross  We were on a break!
Rachel  Y'know Ross why dont you put that on your answering
machine!
Ross  Hey-hey, its valid okay? And Im not the only one who thinks
so, Monica agrees with me.
Rachel  (to Monica) What?!
Monica  (shyly) I dont know.
Ross  Thats what you said last night.
Monica  What I said was, was that I understood. Joeys the one who agreed
with you!
Ross  Okay.
Rachel  Really Joey?
Joey  (pause) What?
Phoebe  Y'know what, but there is, there is no right or wrong, here.
Rachel  No, I think its very obvious whos wrong here.
Ross  Obviously not to Joey.
Joey  (pause) What?
Ross  (to Rachel) Look both, Joey and Monica feel the same way that I do.
No-no-no-no.
Chandler  Guys, guys, guess who I am?! (starts dancing around in an effort to
stop the fighting.)
Phoebe  Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!! Hey!!! (they all stop fighting, Chandler continues
to dance.) Look what youre doing to Chandler!! (Chandler finally stops) (to Ross and
Rachel) Yeah, look, we know this is really, really hard for you guys. Okay? (Ross starts
to leave) You dont, all right you dont have to love each other, okay? You
dont, you dont even have to like each other much right now. But please, you
have to figure out a way to be around each other.
Joey  Yeah, and not put us in the middle.
Phoebe  Yeah, otherwise, I mean thats, thats, thats just it
for us hanging out together. Y'know is that what you want? (they both look away) Can you
be civil?
Rachel  Yeah.
Ross  I can.
Phoebe  Okay. Good, all right, lets get back in the car, cause
its freezing, and my chest is unsupported.
Joey  Oh what, wait, wait a second, I mean, what are we doing? Whos going
with who?
Ross  Look, you guys, you guys should go. (Joey tries to say something, but Ross
cuts him off.) No, Im, you, you planned this all out, and I dont want to ruin
it, so you guys should just go.
Joey  Come on man, you drove all the way up here.
Ross  No, no, really, Ive got to take the car back anyway, Im
spending all day tomorrow with Ben, Its fine, no guilt I promise.
Rachel  Thank you.
Monica  All right, well call you when we get back.
Ross  Okay.
Phoebe  Maybe we can like go to a movie or something.
Ross  Okay.
Phoebe  Or, or the rodeo!!
Ross  That would be great.
Phoebe  Okay!
Chandler  I was being Shelly Winters from The Poseidon Adventure.
Ross  I know!
Phoebe  Bye!!!
[Scene  Carol and Susans, Carol is running to answer the door.]
Carol  (looking through the peephole) Ugh. (opening the door) Ross!
Ross  (entering) Hi! Sorry Im late. Were you sleeping?
Carol  Ahh, nooo!!
Ross  Oh, great! Listen, oh I had to get you a whole new battery. I got you the
best one I could, cause thats not where you want to skimp.
Carol  Youre a genius, Ross.
Ross  Yeah, well it came to about $112, but what the hell, just call it an even
110?
Carol  Okay, Ill pay you tomorrow. (pushes him out the door)
Ross  Okay.
Carol  Okay, bye!!
Ross  So they ah, they all took off, it was pretty hard watching them go,
y'know?
Carol  Yeah, okay, bye. (closes the door, turns out the lights, and runs back to
the bedroom)
Ross  (outside the door) So Im gonna take off then!
[Scene  Central Perk, all but Chandler are there, Joey laughs for no apparent reason.]
Monica  (to Joey) Whats so funny?
Joey  Oh, nothing, no. Its an acting exercise, Im practising my fake
laugh.
Monica  Oh. (she laughs)
Joey  What-whats so funny?
Gunther  (to Chandler) Oh, no-no, no-no-no, theres none of that in here.
Chandler  Oh come on man! At least let me finish this last one.
Gunther  Okay, but only if you give me a drag.
Chandler  Okay.
Gunther  Oh dark mother, once again I suckle at your smokey tit. (hands Chandler
back the cigarette.)
Chandler  No-no, why dont you hang on to that one.
Chandler  Okay, thats like the least fun game ever.
Rachel  Well, Im really sick of your smoking, so I brought something that
is going to help you quit. (hands him an audio cassette)
Chandler  Oh. (takes the cassette and puts it on his arm like the stop smoking
patch, and it falls off.) Nope, that patch is no good. (Joey and Monica both do their fake
laughs.)
Rachel  Come on, its a hypnosis tape. This woman at work used it for two
weeks straight and she hasnt smoked since.
Ross  Pffhah.
Rachel  (to Ross) Whats your problem?
Ross  Nothing, its just that hypnosis is beyond crap.
Rachel  Ross, I watched you get hypnotised in Atlantic City.
Ross  Hey, that guy did not hypnotise me! Okay.
Rachel  Oh right, cause you always pull your pants down at the count of
three and play Wipe-out on your butt cheeks.
Phoebe  All right, y'know forget hypnosis. The way to quit smoking is you have
to dance naked in a field of heather, and then bath in the sweat of six healthy young men.
Chandler  Or what my Father called Thursday night.
[Scene  Central Perk, continued from earlier, Ross is handing Rachel a cup of coffee.]
Ross  Here you go.
Rachel  Oh, y'know what, I didnt want cinnamon on this.
Ross  Sorry. (To remedy that, Ross scoops the cinnamon off of the top with his
hand.)
Frank  (entering) Hi!
Phoebe  Oh my God!!
Frank  Hi!
Phoebe  Frank! Hi!
Frank  How are you?
Phoebe  What are you doing here?
Frank  Oh, well y'know, I wouldve called but I lost your phone number and
then ah, my Mom locked me out of the house so I couldnt find it. And then, I tried
to find a pay phone, and ah, the receiver was cut off. So...
Phoebe  What happened?
Frank  Ah, oh, the ah, vandalism.
Phoebe  But, also, what happened between you and your Mom?
Frank  Well, we got into a fight cause ah, she said I was to immature to
get married.
Phoebe  Your getting married?!
Frank  Oh, yeah!
All  Wow!
Phoebe  My little brothers getting married!!
Frank  Oh, I knew youd be so cool about this. All right, ah, hey, do you
want to meet her?
Phoebe  Do I?
Frank  Do you?
Phoebe  Yeah, I do, yeah.
Frank  Okay, cool, all right, she just ah, parking the truck. (to Joey) Im
gonna, Im gonna get my ah, my fiancée man!
Chandler  Y'know, I wouldve bet good money that hed be the first one
of us to get married.
Phoebe  Yeah, isnt it fantastic?
Monica  Yeah, ah, but Pheebs dont you think hes a little young to
get married?
Phoebe  What, hes 18.
Ross  Exactly, itll be illegal for him to drink at his own bachelor party.
Joey  Yeah, or-or to get a hooker.
Chandler  Always illegal Joe.
Frank  (entering with his fiancée Alice, who is obviously much, much older than
he is) Hey! Hey! This is ah, my fiancée, Mrs. Knight. (he points out Phoebe to her)
Alice  Y'know it-its funny, um, Frank told me so much about you, but your
not how I pictured you at all.
Phoebe  Yeah, Im a big surprise.
Monica  So, um, how-how did you guys meet?
Frank  Well um, I was in ah Mrs. Knights ah, I mean Alice, sorry, Alice, I
always do that. I was in her ah, Home Ec class.
Alice  And he was my best student.
Frank  Yeah, she was my best teacher.
Alice  Ohhh. (They embrace in a very passionate kiss.)
Chandler  If that doesnt keep kids in school, what will?
Ross  And so now you guys are gonna be married?
Alice  Yeah. Y'know we-we talked about just living together, but um, we want to
have kids right away.
Rachel  Oh my God!! Great!
Phoebe  Wow, kids. Frank, are you sure youre ready for that?
Frank  I mean, how hard can it be? Y'know, I mean, y'know, babies, y'know who
doesnt want babies right? And besides y'know, I never had a Dad around, and ah,
now-now I always will, cause y'know, itll be me. Right?
Alice  Y'know, I mean, really we do realise that theres an age difference
between us.
Phoebe  Oh good! Okay. Cause you were acting like you didnt.
Alice  Oh no, but when it comes to love, what does age matter?
[Scene  Chandlers bedroom, Chandler is listening to the hypnosis tape.]
Hypnosis Tape  You are falling fast asleep. Deeper. Deeper. Deeper. You are now
completely asleep. You dont need to smoke. Cigarettes dont control you. You
are a strong, confident woman, who does not need to smoke. A strong, confident woman.
[Scene  The Moondance Diner, Monica is working, Rachel is having lunch.]
Monica  And y'know what, I just realised, in the last year Ive only gone
out with two guys, Richard and Julio. You gotta help me out here, you gotta set me up, you
gotta get me back in the game.
Rachel  Well, that shouldnt be a problem. I mean I work in fashion and all
I meet are eligible straight men.
Monica  (to a customer) Pete, can I get you something else?
Pete  Yeah, a slice of cheesecake and-and a date if youre given
em out.
Monica  Havent you and I covered that topic?
Pete  Hmm, come on, you just said to her that you.
Monica  Aww, the only reason you want to go out with me because my blond wig,
and the big boobs, and the fact that I serve you food.
Pete  Well, if that were true, Id dating my Aunt Ruth. And the two times
we went out were just plain awkward. (to Rachel) Come on, you think she should go out with
me, dont you?
Rachel  (laughs) Well, I mean, are you sure you want to go out with her? I mean
that aint a pretty picture in the morning, yknow what I mean. That wig all in
disarray, and boobs flung over the night stand, y'know.
Monica  I mean really, think about it.
Pete  Ho-ho, I will.
[Scene  Chandler and Joey's, Ross and Joey are being lectured by Phoebe.]
Phoebe  No, I know, I know, that this is Franks life, (walks behind them,
they turn around in the leather chairs to face her) y'know. Y'know, I dont want to
be all judgmental, y'know, but this is sick, its sick and wrong!
Ross  Pheebs, what, is it the age thing?
Phoebe  No-no, oh, Im fine with the age thing y'know, until it starts
sticking its tongue down my little brothers throat!
Joey  Pheebs, he seems to enjoy it.
Phoebe  But, I mean, do you think hes gonna enjoy it when hes up to
his elbows in the diapers from all the babies they have to have right away?! This is not
fair to Frank, (she walks behind them again, and hey again turn to follow her) and
it-its not fair to the babies, and y'know what, its not good home economics.
Joey  Well, have-have you told him how you feel?
Phoebe  Yes. Not out loud.
Ross  Pheebs, if you dont tell him, soon hes gonna be married, and
then youre gonna hate yourself.
Phoebe  Yeah, but if I do tell him, then hes gonna hate myself. I mean
look at him and his Mom, I cant. (pause) But, you guys can, please you gotta talk
him out of it.
Ross and Joey  No-no-no-no-no. (They start to turn away, but Phoebe stops them,
and turns them back to face her.)
Phoebe  Come on, you guys, you have nothing to lose, I have everything to lose.
Do you want me to lose everything? Everything?!
Ross and Joey  No.
Phoebe  Okay, Im gonna go get Frank. (exits)
Joey  So, were walking down the street and I turn to you and I say,
Hey, lets go hang out at Totally Nude Nudes, remember? And then, and
then, you turn to me and say, Nah, lets just hang out at your place.
Well, that was a nice move dumb ass.
[Scene  Monica and Rachel's, Rachel and Monica are entering.]
Rachel  I think you should definitely go out with this guy.
Monica  Nah, he doesnt do anything for me.
Monica  Well, umm, Walker was looking for this big bus load of kids.
(realises) All right, I get your point.
Rachel  All right.
Chandler  (entering, carrying a briefcase) Hi.
Monica  Hey.
Chandler  Y'know, I forgot the combination to this about a year ago? I just
carry it around. Do you have any Chap Stick?
Monica  Uh, yeah.
Rachel  Hey, how are those tapes working out for ya?
Chandler  Y'know what, pretty good.
Rachel  Yeah?
Chandler  Good! I havent smoked yet today, I feel great, and-and-and
confident, that is a stunning blouse.
Rachel  Thank you.
Monica  Here you go.
Chandler  Thanks
Rachel  Hey Mon, lets give Pete a chance Come on, he was funny, he seems
really nice, and that check thing was adorable.
Chandler  What check thing?
Monica  As a joke, this customer at work who has a crush on me gave me a $20,000
tip. His number is on the check, he just did so Id call him.
Chandler  (reading the check) Pete Becker. Pete (quickly grabs a magazine
and opens it up to show her a picture) (pointing to the picture) Is this him?
Monica  Thats Bill Clinton.
Chandler  Whos he huggin?
Monica  Oh my God! Thats Pete! But why is Bill huggin Pete?
Chandler  This guy invented Moss 865! Every office in the world uses that
program!
Rachel  We use it!!
Chandler  There you go!!
Rachel  Oh my God, Monicas gonna go out with a millionaire.
Monica  Im not gonna go out with him.
Rachel  Oh my God, I cant believe this is a real $20,000 check, oh this is
just so exciting.
Monica  Or incredibly offensive.
Rachel  Oh yeah, sure, that too.
Chandler  (to the girls who are staring at him) What?
[Scene  Chandler and Joey's, Ross and Joey are talking to Frank.]
Ross  All were saying is dont rush into anything.
Joey  Yeah, come on, think about it. Youre 18, okay, shes 44, when
youre 36, shes gonna be 88.
Frank  What, you dont think I know that?
Joey  Look, the point is, theres a lot of women out there you havent
even had sex with yet!
Ross  Yeah, he-hes right, hes right. This is your time y'know, yeah,
youre young, youre-youre weird, chicks dig that.
Frank  Okay, but isnt sex better when its with one person that you
really, really care about.
Joey  Yeah, in a poem maybe.
Ross  No the mans right, thats what I had with Rachel.
Frank  You dont have it anymore?
Ross  No, I ah, I slept with someone else.
Frank  Okay, so wait, all right, so how does that make things better?
Ross  It didnt.
Frank  Okay, so what you used to have with Rachel, is what Ive got with
Alice.
Joey  Now, wh-what, what is that like?
Frank  Its so cool man, its so, its just cause being
with her is so much better than like not being with her.
Ross  Yeah, yeah.
Joey  (to Ross) Why cant I find that?
Ross  Dont ask me, I had it and I blew it!
Joey  Well, I want it!
Frank  You can have it!
Joey  I dont know, maybe I cant. I mean, maybe theres
something wrong with me.
Ross  Oh, no! No!
Frank  Its out there man! Ive seen it! I got it!!
Joey  Then you hold on to it!!
Frank  All right, man!!
Joey  All right, congratulations you lucky bastard! (hugs him)
[Scene  Chandler and Joey's, its after Ross and Joeys talk with Frank, and
Phoebes is finding out what happened.]
Phoebe  (to Joey) Youre Franks best man?!
Joey  I couldnt help it, there love is so pure.
Phoebe  Well then, (to Ross) what about you?! Huh?!
Ross  Im the ring bearer.
[Scene  Phoebes, Phoebe is opening the door.]
Phoebe  Hi! Oh, Alice, hi! Thanks. Im so glad you could come, cause
Ive got a real umm, Home Ec emergency. (Points to the table cloth, which has a huge
mustard stain on it.)
Alice  Oh my God, who died on this?!
Phoebe  Yeah, I know. Its a real mustard-tastrophe. Can you help me?
Alice  Absolutely. Okay, first well start with a little club soda and
salt, and then if that doesnt work we can go back to
Phoebe  Y'know what, forget it. Its ruined.
Alice  Oh no-no, never say that. If we cant get it out then we can cut
around the stain, add a little lace, you make a stylish throw.
Phoebe  Or instead, maybe you could just not marry my brother Frank.
[Scene  Petes office, he is participating in a conference call with three other
employees, each of whom are on a different TV screen that he controls with a remote.]
Pete  Okay, thats great, but can we make it smaller? Can we make it fit on
the head of a pin? I love when we make things fit on the head of a pin.
All  Got it. Yeah all right. Yeah, okay.
Secretary  You have a Miss Monica Geller here.
Pete  Uh, absolutely, yeah, sEnd her in. (Monica enters) Hi.
Monica  What the hell is this? (holding up the check)
Pete  Hang on a second. (to the employees) Ill-Ill talk to you in
the morning. (turns two of the three off) Im sorry what?
Monica  Seriously, what is this supposed to mean?
Pete  Well, yknow, I never know how much to tip.
Monica  Youre supposed to double the tax. Not double the tax of Romania. I
mean, whats-whats the deal? Are you, are you trying to buy me? Is this the way
you get girls to go out with you?
Employee  Umm, Im still here.
Pete  (turns off the TV) Youre taking this all wrong. Because, if I
didnt leave you that tip, you wouldnt of come down here, we wouldnt be
having this argument, and there wouldnt be this ah, heat between us.
Monica  What?!
Pete  Come on, you gotta admit that our relationship is ah, is hitting a new
level now. Cause you used to be like the chef, and I was the customer, and now
were like this-this couple that fights.
Monica  Okay, umm, youre a loon.
Pete  Look, forget the check, okay. (rips up the check) I like you. I think
youre great. Come on, what do you say?
Monica  I dont know.
Pete  Why not?
Monica  Cause I dont want to encourage this kind of behaviour.
Pete  One meal! Thats all Im asking for. Please? We go out, we eat,
and if you dont have a good time, I give you ten grand, we call it even.
[Scene  Phoebes, she is coming home. She turns on the lights, and sits down on
the couch.]
Frank  (hiding under a pile of clothes) Hi. (She jumps up screaming.) Wait, no!
Just put the mail down. Its-its me!
Phoebe  Okay. Whoa, sorry. Why were you just like all in the dark?
Frank  Oh well, um, your, your laundry just smelled so good, that I thought
Id curl up in it. Is that all right?
Phoebe  Oh, yeah, sure. So, how was your day?
Frank  Oh, well just probably the worst one since Ive been alive.
Phoebe  What umm, what happened?
Frank  Umm, Alice ah, she ah, called it off.
Phoebe  Oh no. Did umm, did she say why?
Frank  Uh, no, not really, just that I was too young, y'know, but I dont
see how I could all of the sudden be too young, cause Im older than I was when
we first got together.
Phoebe  Yeah, yeah, no, I dont, I dont know. But, y'know what, maybe
its just all for the best?
Frank  Yeah, if the best is like unbelievable pain!
Phoebe  Oh, sweetie, oh. (hugs him)
Frank  Y'know, I just was finally happy y'know. For the first time in my life!
After my Dad left me, and then, and then getting arrested for stealing those birds, and
then, and then the whole punctured lung thing! I can, its still really hard to take
deep breaths in cold weather, but with Alice all that stuff kinda went away. And now
its, and now its gone and I dont know why!
Phoebe  Uh, well I can tell you why. Its, its because of me. But,
y'know what, I only did it because I love you. Okay?
Frank  What?
Phoebe  Umm, well I, I kinda had a little chat with Alice, and I sort of made
her see why you two shouldnt be together, y'know. And youre gonna see it to,
one day, you really, really will.
Frank  Wait a minute, wait, this is because of you?
Phoebe  Okay.
Frank  Well, you, wait no, my Mother didnt want us to be together, but the
worst thing she ever did was tie me to the porch.
Phoebe  Okay, but.
Frank  Wait, y'know what, I-I came to you because I thought youd
understand! Oh no!! Y'know, I would storm out of here right now if-if I had some money, or
a place to go
[Scene  Monica and Rachel's, Rachel is getting Monica ready for her date. The guys are
also there. The door buzzes.]
Rachel  Oh my God! The millionaires here!
Chandler  (in a feminine way) Oh my God! (and he jumps all around)
Monica  Guys, please, Im just gonna have dinner with him. Okay?
Chandler  Okay, okay, just because he buys you dinner, does not mean you owe him
anything.
Monica  I know!!
Chandler  Okay, then get the lobster!
Monica  (opening the door) (to Pete) Hey!
Pete  Hi.
Rachel  Hi!!
Joey  Hey!
Ross  Hi!
Joey  Hey, how much cash do you got in your pocket right now?
Monica  And thats why, Im not inviting you in for a drink. (starts
to leave) Bye.
All  Oh-no-no-no-no.
Rachel  Just one drink?!
Monica  (in the hallway) So, where do you want to go?
Pete  Hey, you like pizza?
Monica  Oh, thats sounds great.
Pete  I know a great little place.
[Scene  A restaurant in Rome, Monica is paying for the pizza.]
Pete  Youre, hey, youre not paying for the pizza!
Monica  Oh come on, its only fair, you paid for the flight. Now is, is
that enough lire?
Pete  Ahh, Id throw another thousand on that.
Monica  Why, how much is that?
Pete  Thats about 60 cents.
[Scene  Chandler and Joey's, its the middle of the night. Joey is walking into
the living room, and runs into the entertainment centre.]
Joey  Every night!!
Hypnosis Tape  You do not need to smoke. Cigarettes dont control you. You
are a strong, confident woman, who does not need to smoke. A strong, confident woman, who
does not need to smoke. (Joey walks out smiling to himself.)
[Scene  Phoebes, Frank is watching TV, and hes very depressed as Phoebe
enters.]
Phoebe  Hey, Frank. Look, okay, I know that you think I did like this totally
evil thing, but I so didnt. Theres someone here who can explain this better
than I can.
Alice  Hi Frank.
Frank  Hi, Mrs. Knight.
Alice  Phoebes right Frank. I know its hard to hear, but it
wouldve been wrong to go through with it. I-I-I was being selfish, even though we,
we want the same things now, in the future we may not. (to Phoebe) Is that it, is that
what it is?
Phoebe  Yeah, but not just that.
Alice  Right, not just that. Umm, even though we love each other as much as we
do, none the less
Phoebe  None the less.
Alice  None the less. Umm, youre too young to, to really know what you
want. (They embrace in a passionate kiss.)
Phoebe  Thats right, exactly. (sees them) All right, its a good bye
kiss, thats good. (Frank picks Alice up and they move to the couch) Bye-bye. (They
both lie down on the couch and start to make out.) Okay, no, the important thing is that
you see what Im saying, y'know, just y'know, this is clearly wrong. (They ignore
her) Okay, Ive decided Im gonna let this happen! Okay, can I just get my
purse? (She reaches in and Alice moans) Okay, all right, good. (leaves).
[Scene  Chandlers bedroom, hes listening to the hypnosis tape again.]
Hypnosis Tape  Cigarettes dont control you. You are a strong,
confident woman, who does not need to smoke.
Joey  (Hes recorded his voice on the tape) Joeys your best friEnd.
You want to make him a cheese sandwich everyday. (he laughs) And you also want to buy him
hundreds of dollars worth of pants.
[Scene  Central Perk, Gunther is pouring Rachel coffee.]
Gunther  Here you go.
Rachel  Thank you.
Gunther  (In his head) Say Rachel, I was wondering if youd like to go
to a movie with me sometime. As my lover! Nnnsch, to out there. Maybe youd just like
to ah, get something to eat with me sometime? As my lover.
Mark  (entering) Hi!
Rachel  Hi! All right, lets go shoppin!!
Mark  Um, y'know, before we go ah, theres something I need to say.
Rachel  Oh, okay.
Mark  Ive kinda of had this ah, this crush on you. (Rachel is shocked) But
since you were with Ross, I-I didnt do anything about it. But, now that youre
not, Id really like to ask you out sometime. So-so thats-thats what
Im doing, now.
Rachel  Wow! Umm....
Gunther  I dropped a cup.
[Scene  The hallway between the two apartments, Pete and Monica are returning from
their date.]
Pete  ...so y'know, thats why, within a few years, that voice recognition
is gonna be pretty much standard on any computer you buy. Y'know, so you could be
like-like, Wash my car. Clean my room. Its not gonna be able
to do any of those things, but itll understand what youre saying.
Monica  Oh, this is so great.
Pete  Yeah, it was.
Monica  All right then. (He leans in to kiss her goodnight, but she quickly
kisses him on the cheek and pats his shoulder.) Bye.
Monica  Hello, people who do not live here.
All  Hi! Hello!
Monica  I gave you a key for emergencies!
Phoebe  We were out of Doritos.
Ross  Hey, howd the date go with Mr. Millionaire?
Chandler  Mr. Millionaire, new from Snooty Playthings! Third wife sold
separately.
Monica  Hes great! I mean we have such a good time together! Hes so
funny, and sooo sweet, and Im not attracted to him at all!!
Ross  Still?!
Monica  Noo!! Its driving me crazy. I mean every other way hes like
the perfect guy, he has everything. Plus! He actually has everything.
Chandler  Life-sized Imperial Storm Troopers from Sharper Image?
Monica  Two.
Chandler  Wow!! Can Joey and I put them on and fight?
Joey  (entering, dancing and singing) Oh mommie, oh daddie, I am a big old
baddie! Oh mommie, oh daddie, I am a big old baddie! (He dances around the dinner table
and exits)
Ross  I guess he musta gotten the part in that play.
Monica and Phoebe  Oh.
Chandler  Yeah, either that, or Gloria Estefan was right, eventually, the rhythm
is going to get you.
[Scene  A Theatre, Joey is arriving to rehearse the play hes in.]
The Director  Joe. Hows it going?
Joey  Good. (He sets his stuff down and starts talking to Kate, another cast
member.) Hey.
Kate  Hi.
Joey  Oh, so youre playing Adrienne, huh?
Kate  Yes. Are you one of the retarded cousins?
Joey  Oh, no. Ah, I playing your husband, Victor. Im Joey Tribianni.
Kate  Hi, nice to meet you. Kate Miller.
Joey  So the ah, plays pretty great, huh?
Kate  Oh, yeah. I love Jennifer Van Murrays work. Shes so
brilliantly incisive when it comes to deconstructing the psyche of the American middle
class.
Joey  Oh, forget about it. She rocks!
Kate  Where do I know you from?
Joey  Dr. Drake Remoray. Days of Our Lives. Voted most datable
neurosurgeon by Teen Beat.
Kate  No, thats not it. So, youre a soap actor? Well this must be
pretty exciting for you to be in a real play, hmm?
Joey  Hey, Ive done plays before. Im a serious actor.
Kate  That info-mercial! For the milk carton spout thing!
Youre-youre-youre the guy that doesnt know how to pour milk!!
Joey  See, I actually can pour milk, but I got you believing that I
couldnt. Now, see, thats acting.
Kate  Right, at the end, you choked on a cookie.
Joey  Yeah, that was real.
[Scene  Central Perk, Rachel is telling Phoebe about Mark, as Gunther eavesdrops behind
them.]
Phoebe  Wow! I cannot believe Mark asked you out.
Rachel  I know.
Phoebe  What, so what are you gonna tell him?
Rachel  Well, I told him I would think about it, but Im gonna tell him no.
Phoebe  Huh.
Rachel  I mean I think Id say no to anybody right now. (Hearing this
Gunther swoops back to cleaning tables.) Oh, but it was so strange. I mean Im
standing there with this charming, cute guy, whos asking me to go out with him,
which Im allowed to do, and I felt guilty. Y'know, like Id be cheating on Ross
or something.
Phoebe  Wow. So, okay, maybe that means that, youre not over Ross yet and
you have issues with your father.
Rachel  I dont have any issues with my Father.
Phoebe  Okay, so its probably just the Ross thing then.
[Scene  Chandler and Joey's, Joey is telling Chandler about Kate.]
Joey  I hate this woman!! I hate her! She told everyone in the company about
that info-mercial, and now they all keep asking me to open their drinks. Okay, and
whenever I cant do it, theyre all like-like laughing at me.
Ross  (entering) Hello.
Chandler and Joey  Hey!
Ross  So Rachel called. Wants to see me. Going over in a minute.
Joey  Wow, what-what do you think she wants?
Ross  Well, maybe the crazy fog has lifted and she realises that life without
me.... a-sucks.
Chandler  Its possible. You are very loveable, Id miss you if I
broke up with you. (Ross glares at him) I was just trying to be supportive.
Ross  Then be supportive like a guy.
Chandler  (in a deep voice) If I broke up with you, Id miss you.
[Scene  Monica and Rachel's, Rachel is there as Ross enters, walking very confidently.]
Ross  Hi.
Rachel  Hi!
Ross  You ah, wanted to see me?
Rachel  Yeah. Ahh, heres a box of your stuff. (hands him a box)
Ross  What?!
Rachel  Oh, y'know, its just like hats, and a shirt, and CDs, just
sort of stuff that youve left here.
Ross  What are you doing? Are you trying to hurt me? Or something?
Rachel  No. Ross, it, it just seems that y'know its time we-we y'know,
move on. I mean, I mean dont you think?
Ross  Yes.
Rachel  Yeah?
Ross  Yes, I do.
Rachel  Good.
Ross  Yeah, I-I really do. (takes a dinosaur mug out of the box) Hey! This-this
was a gift?!
Rachel  Ross, you got that for free from the museum gift shop.
Ross  Its still a gift! I got it from the gift shop!
Rachel  Okay, all right, give me the mug! Ill keep the mug.
Ross  No!! Y'know-y'know dont do me any favours. In fact, where,
wheres the rest of my stuff?! Huh? Like-like my umm, (picks up a book) Hey, this
book is mine!! And-and-and, and that T-shirt you sleep in? Id like that back too.
Yes, I do.
Rachel  You know how much I love that T-shirt! You never even where that
T-shirt!
Ross  Im just trying to help you, move on.
Rachel  Oh, you are a petty man. You are a petty, petty....
Ross  Petty...
Rachel  Petty... (goes into her room)
Ross  Petty...
Rachel  Petty...
Ross  Petty...
Rachel  Small...
Ross  Small... (Rachel comes back into the living room and catches Ross mocking
her.)
Rachel  You are so just doing this out of spite.
Ross  Awwwahuh, no, no, no!!
Rachel  Huh?
Ross  Im-Im gonna wear this all the time! I love this shirt!! (he
kisses the shirt)
Rachel  You have not worn that T-shirt since you were 15!! It doesnt even
fit you anymore!
Ross  Oh, yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah...
Rachel  (imitating him) yeah-yeah-yeah!!
Ross  Oh-oh, okay, okay! (He quickly takes off his sweater in order to put on
the T-shirt. Its an old Frankie says relax T-shirt, that barely fits
him. Rachel nods her head in approval of the new look.) If you dont mind Im
gonna the rest of my stuff, and relax, in my favourite shirt. (Starts to leave) You have a
pleasant evening. (He exits and leaves the door open.)
[Scene  Central Perk, the gang minus Rachel and Ross are talking to Pete.]
Phoebe  So, youre like a zillionaire? (Pete smiles and nods)
Chandler  And youre our age. Youre our age.
Phoebe  Y'know what, you should like, you should buy a state and then just name
it after yourself.
Pete  What like Pete Dakota?
Phoebe  Yeah, or, or, or, Mississ-Pete.
Joey  Oh, oh, I got it! Pete-Chicago.
Chandler  Thats not a state Joe.
Joey  Oh, and Mississ-Pete is?
Pete  I got to go, so ah, Ill see you guys later.
All  Okay.
Chandler  Youre our age!
Pete  (to Monica, by the door) So ah, we on for tomorrow?
Monica  Absolutely! (He goes to kiss her, but she stops him and rubs his head
and says...) Now get out of here you!! (Pete leaves) (to the gang) Okay, Im running
out of places I can touch him! Look, is there something wrong with me? I mean why am I
only attracted to guys where theres no future? Either theyre too old, or
theyre too young, and then theres Pete whos-whos crazy about me,
and whos absolutely perfect for me, and theres like zip going on! I mean,
seriously, does it sound like somethings wrong with me?!
Phoebe  Yeah, kinda.
[Scene  The Theatre, Joey and Kate are rehearsing for the play.]
Kate  Happy?! Is that what Im supposed to be Vic? Happy?
Joey  Well, why dont you tell me what youre supposed to be! Huh?
Because I sure as hell cant figure it out! I talk to you and nothin. You look
at me, and its nothin. (He kisses her) Nothing.
The Director  Tasty! Im really starting to feel like you guys have a
history, its-its nice.
Kate  I have a question about this scene.
The Director  Yes?
Kate  Well, I dont understand why Adriennes attracted to Victor.
The Director  Peel the onion. First of all, hes good looking.
Joey  Yeah.
Kate  I think my characters gonna need a little bit more of reason than
that.
Joey  Oh, hey, how about this one. Ah, its says so in the script! Y'know
ah, I-I dont know why my character likes you either, I mean it says in the script
here that youre a bitch.
Kate  It doesnt say that in the script.
Joey  It does in mine!
[Scene  The Hallway, Chandler and Ross are returning from working out.]
Chandler  I can blow dry it. I can put gel on it. It doesnt matter, I
still wind up with this little (pats the flat spot on the back of his head) cowlicky thing
on the middle part of my head. Its so annoying. Does it bug you?
Ross  You bug me.
Chandler  Is there any chance you didnt see that?
[Scene  Chandler and Joey's, Chandler is watching a basketball game, Ross is staring
out the peephole.]
Chandler  Ross! You gotta stop! Okay?! You cant just stare through the
peep hole for three hours! Youre gonna get peep eye!
Ross  I knew it! I knew it! I always knew she liked him! Y'know, shed say
no, but here we are! Right? We just broke up, first thing she does!
Chandler  You didnt just break up.
Ross  Hey, its been like three weeks!
Chandler  You slept with somebody three hours after you thought you broke up. I
mean bullets have left guns slower!
Ross  Here they come, here they come. Oh-ho, if she kisses him goodnight,
Im gonna kill myself, I swear. I cant, I cant watch this. (turns away,
then quickly turns to look again) Come on, date over! Date over! Uh-oh, here we go,
shes going in.
Chandler  Okay.
Ross  Shes going in. Wait! Hes going in! Hes going in!! The
doors closed! I, I cant see anything but the door closed!!
Chandler  And the inventor of the door rests happily in his grave.
Ross  Okay, I have to do something. I mean, I have, I have to stop it!
Chandler  Stop what?!
Ross  I dont know, but I ah, I have the feeling that my being there will
do it. Ill go over and I will borrow something. Juice!! I need juice!!
Chandler  No!! You cant!!
Ross  Look, they must be stopped!
Chandler  I am your friend, and I am not gonna let you do this!!
(Ross is now dragging Chandler and the foosball table to the door) You are surprisingly
strong!
Ross  I need juice! People need juice!!
Chandler  Look man!
Ross  People need juice!
Chandler  Listen to me!! (Chandler turns him around and closes and holds the
door shut with his feet.)
Ross  Juice, I need...
Chandler  Shes moving on! Okay, if its not this guy, its gonna
be somebody else! And unless youre thinking about subletting my peep hole, you
are going to have to get used to the fact that the relationship is over! Okay, man?
Its over.
Ross  Yeah, okay.
Chandler  Okay.
Ross  Its just I miss her so much.
Chandler  I know. (He rubs Rosss head)
[Scene  Monica and Rachel's, Rachel is pouring Mark some coffee.]
Mark  Why do all youre coffee mugs have numbers on the bottom?
Rachel  Oh. Thats so Monica can keep track. That way if one on them is
missing, she can be like, Wheres number 27?!
Rachel  Y'know what?
Mark  No. And I dont think Im gonna want to.
Rachel  I cant do this.
Mark  Yep. Yep, thats what I didnt want to know.
Rachel  Well, oh, Mark, Im doing this for the wrong reasons, y'know?
Im just doing it to get back at Ross. Im sorry, its not very fair to
you.
Mark  Ahh! Fair, schmair! Y'know? Look, if you want to get back at Ross, I am
here for you. Really? No-no, I say-I say, I say we get back at him right on this couch.
Right here!
Rachel  Oh God. Im sorry about this.
Mark  Thats okay.
Rachel  You sure?
Mark  Yeah. I can just go home and get back at him by myself.
[Scene  A Hospital Reception, Monica and Pete are there.]
Spokeswoman  ...has become the penicillin of the twenty-first century. And so
today, this hospital is about to take major steps toward leading that revolution. It is
truly ironic, on one hand consider the size...
Pete  (to Monica) Hey, can I ask you something?
Monica  Sure.
Pete  Where are we?
Monica  (looks around) Well, with all these doctors and nurses, Im gonna
say, midget rodeo.
Pete  Just tell me the truth.
Monica  Okay. Umm, y'know, I dont think, I dont think I told you
this, but umm, I just got out of a really serious relationship.
Pete  Oh, yeah. Wasnt that like a year ago?
Monica  So I did tell you. Okay, y'know, that really isnt the thing. Umm,
the thing is that, right now Im just in a place in my life where I need to focus on
me. Y'know what I mean?
Pete  Oh, yeah. I know that.
Monica  I so wanna be attracted to you.
Pete  But youre not. Okay, good.
Monica  Im sorry.
Pete  Y'know what, dont be. This is not, dont be, cause
its not so bad.
Monica  Its not?
Pete  I know Im no John Bon Jovi, (Monica laughs) or someone
who find attractive, Im just, I think, y'know, that you might end up feeling
differently.
Monica  Well, um, look I-I dont want this to come our wrong, but ah, you
seem awfully confident for a guy I just told I wasnt attracted too.
Pete  Yeah, stupidly charming isnt it? Well listen lets, you
wanna get something to eat? Cause this place is kinda depressing. (they start
to leave)
Spokeswoman  And the man who made all this possible... Mr. Peter Becker.
Pete  (to Monica) One second.
[Scene  Chandler and Joey's, Chandler is sitting in one of the black chairs, and turns
to face the other one.]
Chandler  I dont think this town is big enough for both of us to relax in.
(He blows on his hand) Draw!! (He quickly pulls the lever to raise the foot rest, like a
gunfighter in a Western.)
Chandler  (to Joey) I wasnt doing anything. (Joey starts angrily throwing
his stuff down.) Uh-oh, what did she do now?
Joey  Just because she went to Yale drama, she thinks shes like the
greatest actress since, since, sliced bread!
Chandler  Ah, Sliced Bread, a wonderful Lady MacBeth.
Joey  God, I just, I hate her! I hate her!! With her, Oh, Im so
talented. and Oh, Im so pretty, and Ooh, I smell so
good.
Chandler  I think somebody has a crush on somebody.
Joey  Hey, Chandler, can we please stay focused on my problem here?! Y'know?
Chandler  Im talking about you. You big, big freak.
Joey  Oh. (realises) Ohh. Ohh, youre out of your mind.
Chandler  Hey, you have nothing but talk about her for the last 48 hours! If you
were in a school yard youd be pulling her pigtails and pushing her down now!
Joey  Oh, yeah?! Then how come I keep thinking about her in all these sexual
scenarios and stuff huh?!
[Scene  The Theatre, Kate and Joey are rehearsing the same scene as before.]
Kate  Happy?! Is that what Im supposed to be Vic? Happy?
Joey  Well, why dont you tell me what youre supposed to be! Huh?
Because I sure as hell cant figure it out! I talk to you and its nothin.
You look at me, and nothin. (He kisses her, more passionately this time) Nothing.
The Director  You guys make me fly! High! Okay, were gonna pick it up
here, tomorrow.
Kate  Well, that was ah...
Joey  Better?
Kate  Yeah! Yeah, it was definitely an improvement. Gnight.
Joey  Ah, Kate?
Kate  Yeah?
Joey  You ah, you forgot your shoes.
Kate  (she giggles) Im probably gonna need those. Huh? (she giggles some
more)
Joey  Hey, listen you ah....
Kate  Hmm?
Joey  ...feel like getting a cup of coffee?
Kate  Umm.
The Director  (leaning in) Kate?
Kate  Yep.
The Director  You ready to go?
Kate  Yeah.
The Director  (to Joey) Very nice. Very nice. (he walks away)
Kate  So umm, Ill see you tomorrow, huh?
Joey  Yeah, yeah sure, goodnight.
[Scene  Monica and Rachel's, Monica is in the kitchen chopping vegetables. Chandler and
Phoebe are sitting in the living room.]
Phoebe  (to Chandler) Hey! (Chandler looks up, startled) Why isnt it
Spiderman? Yknow like Goldman, Silverman...
Chandler  Cause its-its not his last name.
Phoebe  It isnt?
Chandler  No, its not like, like Phil Spiderman. Hes a spider, man.
Y'know like ah, like Goldman is a last name, but theres no Gold Man.
Phoebe  Oh, okay. There should be Gold Man!
Rachel  (entering) Hey!
Monica  Hey, Rach, how was work?
Rachel  Oh, great. Although I did sit down where there wasnt a chair.
Monica  By the way, Ross dropped by a box of your stuff.
Rachel  Oh, well, I guess I had that one coming. Im just gonna throw it
out, its probably just a bunch of shampoo and... (she opens the box and stops)
Monica  Something wrong?
Rachel  (She takes the T-shirt out of the box and holds it to her chest and take
a deep breath.) No. Nothing. (She smiles and goes into her room.)
[Scene  Chandler and Joey's, Phoebe and Chandler are sitting in the black chairs.]
Chandler  So, ahh, what kind of powers would Gold Man have?
Phoebe  Okay well, he would turn things to gold.
Chandler  What about things that are already gold?
Phoebe  Ahh, his work is done.
Chandler  Okay, lets play my game now.
Phoebe  Okay. All right you yellow-bellied-lilly-livered-DRAW!! (they both kick
up the foot rests like an old fashioned gun fight.)
[Scene  Monica and Rachel's, Chandler, Monica, Phoebe, and Joey are there.]
Chandler  Wait a minute, wait. Youre telling me this actress person is the
only woman you ever wanted who didnt want you back?!
Joey  Yeah! Oh my God! (to Chandler) Is this what its like to be you?
Monica  Wow, youre really crazy about her, huh?
Joey  Oh, you have no idea. And-and when were on stage I get to-to kiss
her and-and touch her, but then she goes home with the director, and its like
somebodys ripping out my heart!
Phoebe  Oh, its so great to see you feeling like this!
Ross  (entering) Hey!
All  Hey!
Ross  Monica, uh Dad called this morning and ah, Aunt Silvia passed away.
Monica  Yes!! Yes! Yeah, yeah, yeah!
Ross  We were all pretty shaken up about it.
Phoebe  Wait, am I missing something though? Cause I thought death was
something thats supposed to be sad, in a way.
Ross  Well ah, Aunt Silvia was, well not a nice person.
Monica  Oh, she was a cruel, cranky, old bitch! (Ross gives her a look) (to
Ross) And Im sorry she died. Did Dad say I get the dollhouse?
Ross  You get the dollhouse.
Monica  I get the dollhouse!
Phoebe  Wow, a house for dolls, that is so cool! When I was kid, I had a barrel.
Joey  Uh, Pheebs, you had a barrel for a dollhouse?
Phoebe  No, just a barrel.
Monica  Y'know what, you can play with my dollhouse.
Phoebe  Really?! Really?!
Monica  Any time you want. Y'know, when I was younger, all I wanted to do was to
play with this dollhouse, but no!! It was to be looked at, but never played with.
Chandler  My Grandmother used to say that exact same thing to me.
[Scene  Rachels office, Chandler and her are coming back from lunch.]
Rachel  Hey, Sophie!
Sophie  Hey, Rach!
Chandler  Hey.
Sophie  Hey.
Rachel  Thanks for lunch, Chandler. Y'know, you didnt have to walk me all
the way back up here.
Chandler  Oh, thats-thats okay, no problem. (He starts to look
around her office.)
Rachel  Honey um, honey, you do realise that we dont keep the womens
lingerie here in the office?
Chandler  Yes, I realise that.
Rachel  Summer catalogue! (hands him the catalogue)
Chandler  Thats the stuff! (quickly grabs it)
Joanna  Rachel, I need the Versachi invoice. (to Chandler) Hello! You
dont work for me.
Rachel  (introduces them) Joanna, this is my friend Chandler Bing (to Chandler)
Joanna.
Joanna  Bing! Thats a great name.
Chandler  Thanks, its ah, Gaelic, for Thy turkeys done.
So ah, Im gonna go, nice, nice meeting you.
Joanna  Me too.
Rachel  Bye, Chandler.
Joanna  (to Rachel) So ah, whats wrong with him?
Rachel  Oh, nothing, hes just goofy like that, I actually, hardly notice
it anymore.
Joanna  Oh no, no-no-no, is he ah, married, or involved with anyone?
Rachel  No!! No! Hes not married, or involved, with anyone!
Joanna  Oh, Rachel, (pause) actually, y'know what, forget it.
Rachel  Well, Ill ask him for you, if you want me too?
Joanna  Would you? Or, is it just to sad and desperate, and y'know something
that Sophie would do?
Sophie  Uh, uh, uh, I am here.
Joanna  I know that.
[Scene  Monica and Rachel's, Monica is showing off her new dollhouse. Its a huge
dollhouse, that takes up the entire living room table.]
Monica  Look at it! Ohhh! Wallpapers a little faded, thats okay.
Carpets a little loose. Hardwood floors!!
Phoebe  (entering) Hey!
Chandler  Hello.
Phoebe  Oh! Ooh! Oh Monica! Its so beautiful.
Monica  I know!!!
Phoebe  So, Im here, ready to play.
Monica  Okay.
Phoebe  I brought a bunch of stuff for the house, so check it out. Ha-ha. (She
removes this large ceramic dog that comes up to the second floor and places it next to the
house.)
Monica  Whats this?
Phoebe  Thats a dog, every house should have a dog.
Monica  Not one that can pee on the roof.
Phoebe  Well, maybe its so big because the house was built on radioactive
waste.
Chandler  (holding a tissue) And is this in case the house sneezes?
Phoebe  No, no, thats the ghost for the attic.
Monica  I dont want a ghost.
Phoebe  Well, nobody wants a ghost. But youve got one, because the house
is sitting on an ancient Indian burial ground.
Ross  Wait a minute, the house was built on radioactive waste, and an ancient
Indian burial ground? That would never happen.
Phoebe  Okay, obviously you dont know much about the U.S. government.
Rachel  (entering) Hey!
All  Hello.
Rachel  I need to talk to you!
Ross  Sure, whats up?
Rachel  Oh, sorry. I meant Chandler.
Ross  I-I know. Well if something comes up... (walks away)
Chandler  Oh, I'm glad you guys are past that little awkward phase.
Rachel  Okay, my boss, Joanna, when you left, she started asking questions about
you...
Chandler  Oh-ho, liked what she saw, huh? Dug my action, did she? Checkin
out the Chan-Chan man!
Rachel  (looks at him) That was (pause) surreal. Okay, what do think? Are you
interested at all?
Chandler  Yeah, she seemed cool, attractive. Ill do it.
Rachel  Oh thank you, Chandler, this is so great, shes gonna love me.
Phoebe  (holding a dinosaur) Okay, dinosaur attack!! Quick, everybody into the
house!! Ahh-ahh! (the dinosaur starts attacking the house. She starts to bark like a dog.)
Roof! Rrroof-roof-roof!
Monica  Okay, Phoebe, y'know what? That-thats it, thats it, all
right? No dinosaurs, no ghosts, no giant dogs, okay? Theyre not the right size,
theyre not Victorian, and they just dont go.
Phoebe  Okay, (starts to pack up her stuff) fine. Come dinosaur, were not
welcome in the house of no imagination.
Ross  Uh, Pheebs, while were hovering around the subject. I just have to
say dinosaurs, they-they dont go, rrroof!
Phoebe  The little ones do.
[Scene  The Theatre, Joey and Kate are getting ready to rehearse the play.]
Joey  Hey, Kate!
Kate  Morning.
Joey  Listen, I ah, went to that restaurant that you were talking about last
week...
The Director  Hey, lovely! Come, talk to me a minute! (she goes over to him)
Joey  (to himself) And I ate the food, I had the fish, it was good, yeah. It was
good, yeah...
Woman  Hi, oh, Im Lauren, Kates understudy.
Joey  Oh, hey! Joey Tribbiani.
Lauren  I know! I-Im a big fan of yours.
Joey  (looks at her, shocked) What?!
Lauren  I used to umm, schedule my classes so I could watch Dr. Drake Remoray on
Days of Our Lives.
Joey  Get out of here, really?!
Lauren  Absolutely!
Joey  Yeah?
Lauren  Oh but then, they went and dropped you down that elevator shaft.
Joey  They gave me the shaft all right.
Lauren  (laughing) Oh, youre so funny. Listen, umm, what are you doing
after rehearsals? Do you want to get a drink, or something?
Joey  Well Ahh, (he sees Kate and the director kissing) yeah! Yeah, sure, a
drink sounds great.
Lauren  Cool! I-Ill see you then.
Joey  All right.
The Director  All right, its time to act, my talking props. (Both Joey and
Kate just look at each other.)
[Scene  Monica and Rachel's, Phoebe is entering with her own dollhouse, that she made
herself.]
Phoebe  Hey!
All  Hey!
Phoebe  Look everybody, look at my new dollhouse!!
Rachel  Wow!!
Phoebe  Look, look! (She lifts up the roof, and the front panel falls revealing
the interior.)
Ross  Hey, whats this?!
Phoebe  Oh, okay, its the slide instead of stairs. Watch this. (She slides
a doll down the slide)
Monica  Its very interesting, Phoebe.
Rachel  Whats this?
Phoebe  The Licorice Room, you can eat all the furniture. And, when guests come
over, they can stay on the tootsie roll-away bed.
Ross  This is the coolest house ever!!
Phoebe  Hey, does anybody want to join me in the aroma room? (lights some
incense)
Rachel  All right!
Ross  I would!
Monica  Hey, guys, guys, did you see my new, china cabinet?!
Ross and Rachel  Uh-huh.
Phoebe  Watch, watch. (She turns a strand of Christmas lights strung around the
house.)
Ross and Rachel  Ooohhhh!!
Phoebe  And, and! (She turns on a bubble maker.)
Ross and Rachel  Ahhhh!!
Chandler  (entering) Hey, my Fathers house does that!
Rachel  (to Chandler) O-o-o-okay, how did it go? Tell me everything.
Chandler  Well, the movie was great, dinner was great, and theres nothing
like a cool, crisp New York evening.
Rachel  Hmm.
Chandler  Of course, I didnt get to enjoy any of that, because
Joannas such a big, dull dud!
[Scene  Rachels office, Joannas telling Rachel, her side of the story.]
Joanna  Chandler is fantastic!!
Rachel  What?!
Joanna  Oh God, we just clicked! Yknow how people just click? Like he came
by to pick me up, and I opened the door, and it was just like, click! Did he tell you?
Rachel  Oh, I....
Joanna  Oh, and hes got such a good heart! Doesnt he have a good
heart?
Rachel  Oh, I know...
Joanna  Oh, I know and hes soo sweet! Listen, he said he was going to
call, so put him straight through.
Sophie  Isnt this great?!
Joanna  Dont spoil it.
[Scene  The Theatre, Joey and Kate are rehearsing.]
Joey  Come on baby, dont go. Please? What do you say?
The Director  (answering the phone) Hello. Oh! Its you. Just ah, just
one-one sec. (to Joey and Kate) I am going to take this call. When I continue, I hope that
there will appear on stage this magical thing that in the theatre we call, committing
to the moment! (He goes to take the call.)
Joey  (to Kate) That guys like a cartoon. What do you see in him anyway?
Kate  He happens to be brilliant. Which is more than I can say for that sweater
youre dating.
Joey  Hey, Im not interested in her sweater! Its whats
underneath her sweater that counts. And besides, since ah, since when do you care who
Im going out with?
Kate  I dont care. Why, do you want me to care?
Joey  Do you want me to want you to care?
Kate  Do you?
Joey  What?
The Director  (returning) Okay, Im afraid to say this, but lets pick
it up where we left off.
Joey  Come on baby, dont go. Please? What do you say?
Kate  Ive got no reason to stay.
The Director  Stop!! Stop it! You must stop! You are bad actors! This is a
terrible play! Ill see you in the morning. (exits)
Kate  I cant believe we go on in, in a week.
Joey  Hey, its gonna be all right.
Lauren  (to Joey) Hey! So since were getting off early, do you want to go
and paint mugs?
Joey  What?
Lauren  You know! At the place I told you about last night?
Joey  Oh, yeah, with the mug painting. Yeah. I was so listening to that. But ah,
y'know what, I think I kinda need to work on my stuff tonight.
Lauren  Oh, okay.
Joey  Okay. (he gives her a peck on the cheek)
Lauren  Ill see you tomorrow. (she kisses him full on the mouth.)
Joey  Okay.
Lauren  Gnight. (exits)
Joey  (to Kate) Ah, are you okay?
Kate  Yeah, I guess. Look, what are we gonna do about this scene, huh?
Joey  I dont know.
Kate  Well umm, maybe if it had more heat.
Joey  How do you mean?
Kate  Well, Adrians looking for a reason to stay, right? Victor cant
just kiss her, hes gotta, gotta really give her a reason, y'know?
Joey  Maybe he could slip her the tongue.
Kate  Or maybe, maybe he could grab her, and, and, and, and lift her up.
Joey  Yeah, yeah, and then Adrian, she maybe she could wrap her legs around his
waist.
Kate  And then she could rip off his shirt and kiss his chest, and, and his
stomach!
Joey  And then, then he could use his teeth, his teeth to undo her dress, and,
and, and bite her!
Kate  And then right, right when the scene ends, he could take her with this
raw, animal....
Joey  Something like that?
Kate  Yeah, thats pretty much what I had in mind.
Joey  Yeah.
[Scene  Monica and Rachel's, Ross and Monica are eating breakfast as Joey enters, very
happily.]
Joey  (to Ross) Hey.
Ross  Hi.
Joey  (to Monica) Hey.
Ross  Hi.
Joey  Hey.
Ross  Its a little early to be drinkin.
Joey  No-no, things ah, finally happened with Kate.
Ross  Ohhhhh!
Monica  Youre kidding?! Thats great!
Joey  Oh, it was so amazing. After the (pause) love making...
Monica  Oh my.
Joey  Yep. I just, I just watched her sleep for like hours, just breathing in
and breathing out. And then I knew she was dreaming cause, cause her eyes keep
going like this. (He closes his eyes and moves them around, kinda like hes been
processed by the devil, or something.)
Chandler  (entering with Rachel) Im telling ya, Joannas got it all
wrong. Okay? All I said was, This was fun. Lets do it again sometime.
Ill give you a call.
Rachel  Ohh, gee. I wonder why she thinks youre going to call her?
Chandler  Thats what you say at the end of a date.
Rachel  You cant just say, Nice to meet you, good night?
Chandler  To her face? Look its the end of the date, Im standing
there, I know all shes waiting for is for me to say Ill call her
and its just y'know, comes out. I cant help it, its a compulsion.
Monica  Come on Rach, when a guy says hes going to call, it doesnt
mean hes going to call. Hasnt it ever happened to you?
Rachel  Well, they always called.
Monica  Hmm, bite me.
[Scene  Rachels office.]
Joanna  (entering) Did he call?
Rachel  No. Sorry.
Joanna  Why?! Why?! He said hed call. Why hasnt he called?
Sophie  Maybe hes intimated by really smart, strong, successful women.
Joanna  Sophie, would you please climb out of my butt. Why hasnt he
called, Rachel? Why?
Rachel  Okay, okay. Umm, well ah, maybe he, maybe he feels awkward because you
are my boss.
Joanna  Awkward? Why should he feel awkward?
Rachel  Well...
Joanna  The only person that should feel awkward is you, and you didnt
tell him not to call me, did you?
Rachel  No. I...
Joanna  Because if you feel uncomfortable with your friend dating someone you
work for, there are always ways to fix...that.
[Scene  Central Perk, Chandler is reading a magazine as Rachel approaches.]
Rachel  (grabbing the magazine out of his hands) Call her! Call her now!
Chandler  Multiple, so many paper cuts.
Rachel  Why hasnt he called Rachel? Why? Why? I dont understand.
Why? He said hell call. Why? Why? Chandler Im telling you she has flipped out,
shes gone crazy!
Chandler  (sarcastic) Oh, well give me the phone then.
Rachel  Come on, this isnt funny. She thinks its my fault that you
havent called her. You have to call her!
Chandler  Look, you cant call somebody after this long just to say,
In case you didnt notice, I dont like you!
Rachel  Well then youre going to have to take her out again.
Chandler  Nooo!! Shes really dull! And she gets this gross mascara goop
thing in the corner of her eye!
Rachel  I dont care! I dont care! You are going to have to take her
out again and end it, and end it in way that she knows its actually ended. And, I
dont care how hard it is for you, do not tell her that you will call her again!
Chandler  All right! Fine! But its just a lunch date, no more than an
hour! And from now on I get my own dates, I dont want you setting me up with anybody
ever again!
Rachel  Thats fine!
Chandler  Thats just a lot of big talk, y'know.
Rachel  I know.
[Scene  Monica and Rachel's, Ross is entering.]
Ross  Mon?
Monica  (from the bathroom) Im in the shower!
Ross  Oh, fire! There, theres a fire! Fire!!
[Scene  The Theatre, Kate is arriving for rehearsal.]
Joey  Hey.
Kate  Hi.
Joey  So I ah, talked to Lauren, kinda told her how things were with us. Did you
ah, did you talk to Marshall?
Kate  About what?
Joey  Y'know, about what happened with us.
Kate  Nooo. And theres really no reason he should find out, so ah
lets not make a big deal about it, okay?
Joey  What are you talking about? It was a big deal. I mean, come on you
cant tell me last night didnt mean something to you. I-I was there,
youre not that good an actress.
Kate  Look umm, I, I was, I was just caught up in the moment. Thats all it
was. Joey, Im-Im sorry you feel bad, but havent you ever sleep with a
women where it meant more to her than it did to you?
Joey  Nooo.
Lauren  (entering) Hi, Kate!
Kate  Hi, Lauren.
Joey  Hi, Lauren.
Lauren  Hi, pig!
[Scene  Monica and Rachel's, Monica and Ross are inspecting the damage to the
dollhouse.]
Ross  Sorry I ah, I scared you in there.
Monica  Oh, thats okay. By the way, I was just checking the shower
massager.
Ross  Yeah.
Phoebe  (entering) Hey!
Monica  (runs over to her) I tried to reach you at work. Theres....been a
fire.
Phoebe  What?! Oh my... (sees the remains of the house) Oh my God!! What
happened?!
Ross  Well, we believe it originated here. (He uses a pointer and points to the
point of origin.) In the Aroma Room.
Phoebe  All right. Did everyone get out okay?
Monica  Well, the giraffes okay. And so is the pirate.
Phoebe  Ohh. What is this? (She sees a tissue covering something, and moves to
remove it.)
Ross  No Phoebe, dont look! You dont want to see whats under
there!!
Phoebe  (She pauses to ready herself, and removes the tissue.) Ohh, the-the
Foster puppets!
[Scene  Rachels office, Chandler and Joanna are returning from their lunch date.
He is telling her about her mascara problem. Rachel is already there.]
Chandler  Its not a big deal. Its, just its right here,
(points to his eye) and its all the time.
Joanna  Well, thanks again for lunch.
Chandler  (He looks over at Rachel, who nods her head) Yes, this, this was
pleasant.
Joanna  It was, wasnt it?
Chandler  The food there was, was great.
Joanna  Wasnt it?
Chandler  So take care.
Joanna  You too.
Chandler  Well, this was great. Ill give you a call. We should do it again
sometime. (Rachel is disappointed)
Joanna  Great! Im looking forward to it. Rachel, any messages?
Rachel  Sophies desk.
Rachel  (whispering) Chandler!! Are you gonna call her!
Chandler  Noo!
Rachel  Chandler!!
Chandler  Look, Im sorry. Okay? Im weak, and pathetic, and sorry.
Rachel  Okay, you are going to tell her and youre going to tell her now.
(She grabs his nipple and starts to twist it.)
Chandler  AhhhhIm not going to call you.
Joanna  What?
Chandler  Im sorry. Im-Im-Im sorry that I said I was
going to when Im not. Look, this has nothing to do with you, y'know? And this
isnt Rachels fault. Its me. I have serious, serious problems when it
comes to women. I have issues with commitment, intimacy, (pause) mascara goop. And
Im really sorry, its just that this is not, this isnt going to work out.
Joanna  Well, this isnt how I was hoping how this would end, but I guess I
have to appreciate your honesty.
Chandler  Yeah, o-okay.
Joanna  So...
Chandler  Well this is great! Ill give you a call! We should do it again
sometime!
[Scene  Chandler and Joey's, Joey is talking on the phone.]
Joey  (on phone) Well, so anyway Beth, what Im saying is I shouldve
considered your feelings before I went home with you that night. Ive ah, Ive
recently learned whats it like to be on your side of it, and Im sorry. So, do
you think you can forgive me? (listens) Great. Thanks. Okay, bye. (He sits down and
crosses out something, and dials the phone again.) Hello, Jennifer? (listens) Oh hi, Mrs.
Loreo, is Jennifer there? (listens) Oh, shes not home huh? (listens) Well ah,
actually I kinda need to talk to you too.
[Scene  Outside Central Perk, Rachel and Phoebe are helping Monica learn
how to roller skate by rolling her between themselves.]
Rachel  So whos idea was it to put everybody in the diner on skates?
Monica  Oh, some idiot customer put a suggestion in the suggestion box.
Phoebe  Oh my God, they took my idea!
Monica  That was you?!
Phoebe  Yeah! Okay, here you go. (rolls her back to Rachel)
Gunther  (bringing Rachel a mug) Rachel, I made you a cocoa.
Phoebe  Oh my God, are you guys okay?
Gunther  Are you all right?
Joey  (leaving Central Perk and seeing Monica laying on top of Rachel who is
moaning in pain.) Oh my.
Chandler  (sporting a goatee) Hey.
Joey  Hey. Y'know with that goatee you kinda look like Satan.
Chandler  Oh, so thats why the priest threw holy water on me.
(theres no reaction from Joey) Okay, listen, you have to cheer up! Okay? You
should come out with Ross and me, I mean anything is better than sitting around here
crying all day about Kate.
Joey  Hey I was crying because, because nobody believed Quincys theory.
Okay?
Ross  (entering) Hey!
Chandler  Hey.
Ross  (triumphantly) Im gonna be on TV!!
Chandler  No way!
Ross  Yeah! Theyre putting together this panel to talk about these fossils
they just found in Peru and The Discovery Channels gonna film it!
Chandler  Oh my God! Whos gonna watch that?!
Ross  Thanks. You ready to go?
Chandler  Yeah. (they start to leave)
Joey  Saw a girl with that vest.
Chandler  Thanks. (He takes off the vest and throws it on the floor.)
Anchorwoman  (on TV) While most of us think of chocolate bunnies and baskets as
traditional Easter gifts. Some people insist on giving live chicks as presents. (Joey is
intrigued by the idea) Unfortunately, the sad fact remains that most of these little guys
wont live to see the fourth of July. (Joey starts to call a place to buy a little
baby chick) Because of as a result of improper care, they will be dead.
Joey  (on phone) Yeah, hi. You guys got any of those baby chicks? Cause I
was watching this ah, commercial on TV and man, those guys are cute!
[Scene  The Moondance Diner, Pete is entering, Monica is on roller skates.]
Pete  Hi!
Monica  Hi! Hey, Pete youre back! Hey, check this out. (She starts to
skate over to him)
Pete  Wow! Skates!
Monica  Wow! Youre a lot sturdier that Chandler. He crumpled like a piece
of paper. So how was youre trip?
Pete  Well... (he holds up a gift he brought her)
Monica  Oh, whatd ya bring me?! (She opens the gift) Awww, hotel
toiletries from Japan. Oh, these are gonna go in my permanent collection. You want some
coffee?
Pete  Yeah, sure, thatd be great.
Monica  (popping back up) Regular or decaf?
Pete  Ah, which ever is closest.
Monica  Okay. (hands him a cup)
Pete  So ask me what I did today.
Monica  So what did you do today Pete?
Pete  I bought a restaurant and I would like you to be the head chef.
Monica  What?! Oh.(She turns around quickly and falls)
[Scene  Monica and Rachel's, Monica is telling Rachel about Petes offer.]
Monica  Can you believe he just offered me a restaurant?
Rachel  What a jerk! You want me to kick his ass?
Monica  I mean this has been like my dream since I got my first Easy Bake Oven
and opened Easy Monicas Bakery. I mean I would kill for this job. I mean I can
totally do this job, and God knows I paid my dues. (She removes her fake breasts) But
Petes just doing this because he has a crush on me.
Rachel  And youre still not attracted to him at all?
Monica  Hmm, no. I mean how can I accept a restaurant from him? I-I-I-I
cant. I couldnt even accept a necklace from Stu Vincent in the seventh grade.
Rachel  Yeah, but Mon thats totally different. He was youre health
teacher.
Monica  Oh, please.
Monica  What? Honey.
Rachel  Oh, I am, my side still hurts from when you crashed into me yesterday.
Monica  Oh God, Im so sorry.
Rachel  I know.
Rachel  Ow!!
Monica  Oh God!
Ross  (entering, wearing a white suit with a little red bow tie) Hey, you guys!
Guess what?
Rachel  (looking at the outfit) Got a job on a river boat?
Ross  Y'know what I didnt wear this suit for a year because you hated it.
Well, guess what? Youre not my girlfriend anymore so...
Rachel  Oh I see, so this suit is making a point.
Ross  Right.
Rachel  Now that youre on youre own, youre free to look as
stupid as you like.
Ross  (to Monica) You like it right?
Monica  Oh absolutely. I like it even more on you than I did on Colonel Sanders.
(Ross starts to leave) Ross! Ross! Im kidding!
Rachel  Yeah, come here!
Monica  What-what was it you were gonna tell us?
Rachel  Yeah. Oh! Was how you invented the cotton gin?!
Ross  Okay, good bye! (leaves)
[Scene  Chandler and Joey's, Chandler is talking to Phoebe about her suggestion.]
Chandler  So um, after you put the suggestion in the box, how long did it take
for the roller skating thing to happen.
Phoebe  Umm, oh, about three months.
Chandler  Okay, so I guess thats about ah, two weeks before the topless
thing kicks in.
Joey  (entering carrying a box) Hey!!
Chandler  Hey!
Joey  I got you something! Open it! Open it!
Chandler  Okay. (He opens it and its a baby chick) Its a chicken.
Joey  Its cute, huh?
Phoebe  Whoa-whoa-whoa, you guys, do you know anything about chicks?
Chandler  Fowl? No. Women? Nooo.
Phoebe  Okay, well they are a huge responsibility, especially at this age. They
require constant care. They-they need just the right food, and lots and lots
of love.
Joey  Oh, well no problem there. (He picks up the chick, hugs it really tight,
and talks to it like its a little baby.)
Chandler  Easy Lenny.
[Scene  The Moondance Diner, Pete is talking to Monica about the restaurant.]
Pete  So? I mean have you thought about it?
Monica  Okay. Heres the thing.
Pete  Oh no, not the thing. I hate the thing. Whats the thing?
Monica  I cant do it. Im sorry, I wish I could, but umm, see you
have these feelings for me....
Pete  Wait, wait, wait, wait, thats-thats what youre worried
about? If thats the problem, weve got no problem.
Monica  Huh?
Pete  No! Look, I was gonna tell you this over dinner, but I met somebody else.
On my trip.
Monica  Oh?
Pete  Her names Ann, shes a journalist. Ahh, we met on the plane.
She asked me if she could finish off my peanuts, I thought she said something else, we had
a big laugh. Yeah, I just, I mean I got, I got tired of waiting.
Monica  Oh, thats great! I mean Im-Im sorry, but Im so
happy for you. And now I can work for you!
Pete  I guess you can.
Monica  Oh my God! Oh, this is incredible! Ohh! (she rolls over and kisses him
on the cheek) All right, y'know what? Im just gonna roll right into that office
and-and quit!
Pete  All right.
Monica  Okay. (she gets ready to go) Can you give me a little push?
Pete  Yeah, sure. Good luck!
Monica  (rolling towards the office) Im quitting!! Woo-hoo! (She rolls
through a doorway and out of sight. We then hear a big crash, and see Monica roll past the
door the other way.) Im okay!! Im all right!!
Phoebe  (to Pete) Wow! Thats exciting, you went to Japan, made up a woman.
Pete  What?
Phoebe  Im just saying, this woman, I mean shes fictitious. No?
Pete  Why would you say that?
Phoebe  Cause youre still into Monica. So you told her there was
somebody else so she would agree to work with you, so cause you figure oh if you
spent a lot of time together, maybe something might happen, and...
Pete  Youre good. Youre good!
Phoebe  Yeah, no, Im fairly intuitive and psychic. Its a substantial
gift.
Pete  Listen, can you promise me that you wont tell her though?
Phoebe  Absolutely, oh I promise. Tell her what?
Pete  Thanks a lot.
Phoebe  No Im serious. I mean Im intuitive, but my memory sucks.
[Scene  Chandler and Joey's, Chandler is baby-chick sitting.]
Chandler  Okay, but this is the last time. (singing) With a chick-chick here,
and a chick-chick there. Here a chick, there a chick, everywhere a chick-chick-(Joey
enters)-chickeeeen.
Joey  Hey.
Chandler  Hey.
Joey  Hows she doing?
Chandler  She?
Joey  Well yeah, dont-dont you think its a she?
Chandler  I dont know. (He picks the chick up and turns it over, trying to
determine the sex of the chick, and blows on it.) I cant tell, what ever it was went
back in too quickly.
Joey  Well, anyway, I got to go change, Im ah, meeting some of the cast
for drinks.
Chandler  Excuse me?
Joey  What?
Chandler  I stayed home from work today while you were at rehearsal so somebody
could be here with our chick!
Joey  Hey! Who was up from 2 oclock this morning until 5 oclock this
morning trying to get her back to sleep?
Chandler  You dont think I get up when you get up?
Joey  Ohhh, here it comes.
Chandler  Yes, here it comes! Im stuck here all day, and then you come in
and spend two seconds with us and then expect to go off gallivanting with your friends?
Well I dont think so mister!
Joey  Hey!! I need to relax! Okay? I was working all day!
Chandler  And you dont think taking care of our chick is work?
Joey  Thats not what I said. Okay, I just meant...
Chandler  I know what you meant!! (pause) You notice that ever since we got this
chick, weve been fighting a lot more than we used too?
Joey  I dont know, maybe we werent ready to have a chick.
Chandler  Ill take her back tomorrow.
Joey  Do you think well get our three bucks back?
Ross  (entering carrying a garment bag) Hey!
Chandler  Hey!
Ross  (sees the chick) Ohhh, hey! All right, listen, I-I have that TV thing in
like two hours, and I need your help, okay? What do you think? (takes out two suits) This
blue suit, or this brown one?
Joey  Well, the brown one brings out your eyes, but your butt looks great in the
blue one.
Ross  Really? (Joey gives him a Like I would know look)
[Scene  Monica and Rachel's, Rachel is trying to take some aspirin.]
Rachel  (she reaches for the bottle) Oww! (She grabs the bottle, but has trouble
opening it. She pops the top off and aspirins fly all over the place as Ross enters.)
Ross  Wow! That aspirin dance really works!
Rachel  (She bends over to try and pick up the aspirin) Oww!
Ross  Oh my God, is that still...
Rachel  Im fine, Im fine.
Ross  No youre not.
Rachel  Yes I am!
Ross  Rach!
Rachel  Look, Im fine. Watch. (She picks up an aspirin between her toes)
Look at that. (She lifts her leg to grab the aspirin with her hand and almost falls over.)
Whoa-whoa!
Ross  (stopping her from falling) Okay, okay. Look, you have got to go to a
doctor! Okay?
Rachel  No. I have got to get ready and go to a dinner at my bosses
house. Its a very big deal, theres a lot of people there I have to meet.
Ross  And Im sure youre gonna make a big impression. Hi! Im
Rachel Green. Its nice to meet you. (He lifts his leg and imitates shaking hands
with it, just like how Rachel was trying to pick up the aspirin with her feet.) Come on,
you probably have a broken rib!
Rachel  Well, I will go to the hospital tomorrow, itll still be broken
then.
Ross  Rach...
Rachel  But y'know, I could use a hand getting ready.
Ross  Rachel...
Rachel  Look, either help me or go.
Ross  Fine. Ill go.
Rachel  (with a hurt expression on her face) Okay, but before you go, could you
help me first?
Ross  (He checks his watch) Sure. Ill help you.
Chandler  (rushing in) Oh, good! Good! Do you guys know how to get a chick out
of a VCR?!
Rachel  (She drops the brush) Y'know what? I cannot do this with my left hand!
Would you please, help me with this too?
Ross  Ohh. (He drops the shoes, takes the brush from her, and licks the tip. He
doesnt like how it tastes.)
Rachel  (taking the brush back) Okay. Lets use this brush. (Hands him
another one.)
Ross  Okay. This stuff?
Rachel  Yeah.
Ross  All right.
Rachel  Careful. Light. Okay, do you know how, just sweep it across the lid.
Okay? Just sweep it.
Ross  Oke-dokey. (He pokes her in the eye with the brush.)
Rachel  Oh-ho!
Ross  Sorry.
Rachel  Hey! Thats just poking me in the eye!
Ross  Sorry, Im sorry. Close, close, close...
Rachel  Okay, just sweep it.
Ross  Im sweeping...
Rachel  Right.
Ross  Sweep, sweep....(He starts to paint it on her eye, making it look like she
has a black eye.)
Rachel  Okay, now make it even, cause we dont...
Ross  What? What?
Rachel  We dont want it-it to be too much, we want it to be subtle.
Ross  No. No, y'know you dont, you dont wear enough of this. (Rachel
is shocked) What?
Rachel  Since when, since when do you think I dont wear enough of this?
Ross  Well I, close your eyes, I just think youre gonna like this a little
better, cause, close-close... (He gets some more on the brush)
Rachel  Blow it.
Ross  (blows it) Sorry. Cause umm, I think this will make you a little
more sophisticated.
Rachel  Sophisticated like a hooker?
[Scene  Central Perk, Monica is entering, Phoebe is already there.]

Phoebe  Ohh, Monica, I am so excited for you.
Monica  I know.
Phoebe  Ooh, I have to tell you something.
Monica  What?
Phoebe  But I cant tell you.
Monica  Okay, but wouldnt it be easier if you had to tell me something
that you could tell me.
Phoebe  Well, sure in a perfect world. But, no, I promised I wouldnt tell,
and I swore to like all my gods.
Monica  Okay. Does it have to do with Ross and Rachel?
Phoebe  No.
Monica  Does it have to do with Joey?
Phoebe  No.

bed?
Phoebe  No, but lets come back to that later!
[Scene  Rachels Bedroom, Ross is finishing up her make-up.]

Ross  (checks his watch) Sure, okay.
Rachel  Okay. Okay, great! Umm, okay, just turn around.
Ross  What?
Rachel  I dont want you to see me naked!
Ross  Rachel, Ive seen you naked a million times. I ate hot fudge off you
naked. Remember, I-I sucked that mini-marshmallow out of your belly button?
Rachel  Yeah, but that was different. Yknow? I mean, we were, we were
going out then, now I think its weird.
Ross  Rach, y'know I can see you naked any time I want.
Rachel  What?
Ross  All I have to do is close my eyes. See? (closes his eyes) Woo-hoo!!
Rachel  Ross! Stop that!
Ross  Ah, Im sorry.
Rachel  Come on! I dont want you thinking of me like that any more!
Ross  Ahh, sorry, nothing you can do about it. Its one of my ah, rights as
the ex-boyfriend. (closes his eyes again) Oop, oh yeah!
Rachel  Stop it! Cut it out! Cut it out!
Ross  Okay, okay, Im sorry, it will never happen... (closes eyes) Uh-oh!
Wait a minute! Wait-wait, now there are a hundred of you and Im the king.
Rachel  Rosss...
Ross  Come on, would you grow up? Its no big deal.
Rachel  All right. (She starts to take off her robe) Fine.
Ross  Yowzah!!!
Rachel  O-kay!! See what you did, Im gonna be doing it by myself now.
Okay?
Ross  Aww, come on.

a cab.
Rachel  Okay. Oh wait, wait-wait, youre not gonna come with me?
Ross  (He thinks about it) Of course I am. I just have to make a call.
Rachel  Okay.
Ross  Okay? (goes into the living room)
Rachel  Thank you. (She goes to take off her make-up and screams in pain)
Oww!!!! God!
Ross  (rushing back in) What?! I wh-, whats wrong?
Rachel  Im sorry, I just cant go to the hospital lookin like
this.

different kind of chick. I love you both. But in very different ways.
Joey  (entering) Hey!
Chandler  Hey!
Joey  (sees hes watching Baywatch) Ohhh. (sees he still has the
chick) Ahh! What are you doing?! I thought you were gonna take her back to the store
today.
Chandler  I did! But the store wouldnt take her back! So then I took her
to the shelter, and you know what I found out?
Chandler  If they cant find a home for her, they kill her! And Im
not gonna let that happen to little Yasmine!
Joey  Okay, good, good, good, cause, good, cause I was kinda having
second thoughts too.
Chandler  Okay. And its not just chicks y'know? Its all kinds of
other animals!
Joey  Thats horrible! Well, you did the right thing man.

Pete  Now, nooo! Im just excited about the restaurant, thats all.
Monica  Pete.
Pete  Okay, I love you. Is that so bad?
Monica  No, its not bad. Its not bad at all. Its-its
really nice.
Pete  Look, the only who stands to get hurt is me. And Im okay with that.
Monica  You may be okay about getting hurt, but I am not okay with being the one
who hurts you. Thats why I cant take this job.
Pete  What?
Monica  And well, we probably shouldnt see each other anymore. Im
sorry.
Pete  Okay, yeah. I mean... If thats, if thats really what you want,
okay.
Monica  Okay, bye.
Pete  Im sorry things didnt work out...

Ross  I was kinda, supposed to be on TV tonight for The Discovery Channel.
Rachel  Oh my God!
Ross  Yeah.

Phoebe  Like a date type (looks at Rachel) person?
Ross  Yeah, kinda. Its this woman from work. I hope that wont be too
weird. Will it, Rach?

Chandler  Bye!
Monica  Bye-bye!
Rachel  Okay, I need a date! (runs to her bedroom)
Joey  Oh, hey, you guys are finally gonna get to meet Kate!
All  Oh!
Joey  (to Chandler) And I ah, borrowed some of your cologne. I hope she likes
it.
Monica  Joey, what are you doing?! Its never gonna happen, shes
seeing somebody.
Chandler  Yeah, and I dont have any cologne.
Joey  The green bottle next to the shaving cream.
Chandler  Oh! Worm medicine for the duck.
[Scene  Monica and Rachel's, Monica is getting ready to go to Joeys premiere and
Phoebe is still on hold.]
Monica  (to Phoebe) Here you go. You can wear this. (hands her a sweater)
Phoebe  Thanks!
Monica  Uh-huh.
Phoebe  Okay. (on phone) Ooh, Im setting the phone down. (does so) But
Im still here! Just dont go anywhere Im still here. (starts to put on
the sweater) Dont-dont switch or anything, cause Im, Im
right here. (She has pulled the sweater over her head, but her head is stuck in a sleeve.)
Just one sec. One sec! One second!! (She is now frantically trying to get the sweater on,
as Monica returns from the bathroom.) Wait! One second! Just
Monica  Phoebe?
Phoebe  What?! Monica, Im scared!!
Monica  All right. Honey, thats-thats a sleeve. Okay?
Phoebe  Yeah.
Monica  And! We also have speaker phone. (She turns on the speaker phone.)
Hold Voice  Please, stay on the line. Your call is important to us.
Monica  Okay, wait, you gotta hang up cause were gonna be late.
Hold Voice  Thank you for your patience, youre the next caller.
Phoebe  Yes!! Yes!! Im the next caller! You were gonna have me hang up.
Chandler  (entering, carrying the chick and duck) Hey! Can you take a duck and a
chick to the theatre?
Monica  Of course not.
Phoebe  No.
Chandler  Okay. I just wanted them to hear it from somebody else.
[Scene  Joeys Premiere, Rachel is already there with her date, Tommy who's played
by Ben Stiller who will be in There's Something About Mary and Meet The
Parents, as Ross and his date, Cailin, arrive.]
Ross  Hey, hey Rach!
Rachel  Oh, hi!
Ross  Hi!
Rachel  How are you? (She goes to kiss him on the cheek, but stops because of
the dates and pats him on the shoulder.)
Ross  Good.
Rachel  Hey.
Ross  So its looks like were the first ones here.
Rachel  Yeah, looks that way. First ones here! Wooo!!
Ross  Yay!!
Rachel  Oh! Tommy, this is Ross. Ross, Tommy.
Tommy  Hey.
Ross  Hey. Oh, Im sorry, this is Cailin.
Ross  And! Break!!
Rachel  Okay, uhh, I think Im going to run to the ladies room.
Tommy  Okay.
Cailin  Ill join you.
Tommy  Ill get our seats.
Ross  Okay. (The girls leave.) (to Tommy) So uh, well, this-this is uh, this is
awkward.
Tommy  Yeah?
Ross  Well y'know cause Rachel and I used to go out.
Tommy  Oh, I didnt, I didnt know that.
Ross  Oh! Well then this is awkward. So what do you uh
Tommy  I think were here.
Ross  Oh! Yeah.
Tommy  Yeah.
Ross  Okay. (sees two people sitting in their seats.) Uh, huh. Excuse me,
Im sorry, I-I think you may be in our seats.
Man  Umm, no, I dont think so.
Tommy  Can-can we take a look at your ticket?
Man  Sure. (Hands him the ticket.)
Ross  (looking at ticket) Yep! Yeah, see this says D-13, and uh
Man  Oh, well I thought that ah
Tommy  Oh, you thought, huh? Yeah, well that didnt really work out too
well for you did it you idiot!! What are you?! A moron!! Huh?! It says D-13! Okay?!
Look youre surrounded by even numbers!! Did that give you some clue?!
Man  Uh, the usher told us to come
Tommy  Oh! Oh! The usher must be right! What, with all that training they go
through! Get out!! (They start to leave.) Here! (He throws him back his ticket.) (to Ross,
calmly) Hey man, you want the aisle?
Ross  No, Im good. (He sits down, stunned.)
[Scene  The Theatre, at the post premiere party. The gang is already there, except
Phoebe. Joey runs in.]
Chandler  (seeing Joey) There he is!
Monica  Theres our star!
Joey  So, so, whatd ya think?
Chandler  Almost as good as that play with the two naked girls on the see-saw.
Joey  I-I wasnt in that.
Chandler  I know.
Joey  (sees Kate) Oh-oh, hey-hey, Kate! Listen I want you to meet everybody.
Everybody, this is Kate.
Monica  Hi!
The Director  (stepping in) Excuse me. Excuse me. (to Kate) Sweetheart! (Kisses
her.) Come! (They leave.)
Chandler  So thats the girl you like.
Joey  Yeah.
Ross  (drags Chandler over to buffet table) Im telling you, this guy
Rachel is with is crazy! Okay? He viscously screamed at total strangers! I think hes
baaad news!
Chandler  Wait a minute, wait a minute, you dont like the guy
Rachels dating? Well, thats odd.
Joey  Oh, hey, Lauren. Uh, you guys this is, this is Kates understudy,
Lauren.
Rachel  Oh, hi!
Lauren  Hey.
Rachel  Hey. Gosh, you look soo familiar.
Lauren  Oh, yeah! I-I ran into you in the hallway in your building. It was right
after I slept with Joey. He dumped me the next day.
Cailin  So. Howd you guys meet?
Pete  Well ah, the short version is, I ah pursued her for a couple of months,
then I gave her a check for 20,000 dollars, and she was mine.
Monica  Yeah, and in the long version, I dump him for telling people the short
version.
Estelle  Joey, sweetheart, you were fabulous!
Joey  Hey you guys, this is my agent, Estelle.
Estelle  How do you do. (to Rachel and Monica) Ooh, you two girls were
outstanding! (to Joey) Did they have representation?
Joey  No, they-they werent in the play.
Rachel  Were not actors.
Estelle  Ooh, what a shame! Because with her face (points to Monica) and her
chest (points to Rachel) I could really put something together.
Chandler  Could I borrow it?
Cailin  (to Ross) Hi! Remember me?
Ross  Hi! Yeah! Tommys in line for the bathroom and someone just cut in
front of him, I think hes gonna snap. (Hes watching very intently)
Cailin  Ross, Im gonna go.
Ross  Go? Why?
Cailin  I dont know. Could be because I dont feel like standing
around all night waiting for some guy who may or may not scream.
Ross  But-but Cailin, he definitely will scream.
Cailin  Good bye Ross.
Ross  Uh, oh-ho bye.
The Director  (entering carrying a newspaper) Here we go people! (starts reading
the review) Boxing Day! The Lucille Lortel Theatre, blah-la-la-la Ah-ha! Joey
Tribianni, gives an uneven performance, but Mr. Tribianni is not the worst thing in this
production.
Joey  Yes!!! Ha-ha-ha!
The Director  Kate Millers awkward and mannered portrayal is laughable.
(Kate walks away depressed.) Badda-badda-badda. Ah-ha! Here it is! The direction by
Marshal Talmant is (stops, reads it again, and throws down the paper in disgust)
Thank you, boys and girls, youve ruined my life. Please, stuff your talentless faces
with my Mothers crab cakes! (starts to leave) Excuse me!!
Joey  Anyone mind if I save this?
[Scene  Monica and Rachel's, Monica and Rachel are returning. Phoebe is still on
hold.]
Monica  Hey!
Rachel  Hey!
Phoebe  Oh, is the play over?
Monica  Yeah. Where were you?
Hold Voice  Thank you for your patience, youre the next caller.
Monica  You were the next caller five hours ago. You must be going crazy.
Phoebe  Nah. I kept myself busy.
Phoebe  Oh, okay, yeah. (to Monica) I put your stuff in her room, and her stuff
in your room.
[Scene  The Theatre, after the party. Joey is trying to comfort Kate.]
Joey  Hey! Are you okay?
Kate  Fabulous.
Joey  Listen, drama critics theyre nothing but, but people who
couldnt make it as actors. You know what you should do?
Kate  Become a drama critic!
The Director  (entering, drunk) I am hurt! (to Joey and Kate) A plague on both
your houses! (walks away)
Kate  By the way, he dumped me tonight after he read my review.
Joey  Oh, classy.
Kate  Yep! I sure know how to pick em, huh? Y'know I gave up a part on a
soap for this!
Joey  Wow! Yeah I ah, I gave up a job too.
Kate  Really. What?
Joey  Uh, de-clawing cats. Hey, tell ya what. Let me walk you home. Well
stop by every news stand and burn every copy of their Times and the Post.
Kate  Why the Post?
Joey  Oh, you didnt see the Post?
Kate  No. You?
Joey  No. Why?
[Scene  Kates Apartment, Joey and Kate are returning from a night out on the
town.]
Kate  (drunk) So you really think those newspapers are just jealous of me?
Joey  Oh, absolutely! Youre talented and youre good looking.
Kate  Oh, youre sweet and cute.
Joey  I know! Thats why they trashed me!
Joey  Whoa. Wait a minute, wait a minute.
Kate  What?
Joey  I, I dont get you. I mean first, you hate me. Then you sleep with
me. Then you want nothing to do with me, now you want me again.
Kate  What? So you never went out with an actress before?
Joey  Kate, do you even like me?
Kate  Of course I do.
Joey  Well so, how come you blew me off? Y'know? How come you were with him?
Kate  I dont know! I just, just do this! I-I always have to pick the like
the smartest guy, or-or the most talented guy Why cant I just pick someone
like you?
Joey  Thanks.
Kate  You know what I mean. I mean like the sweetest guy. Joey, youre just
so, youre so, so (She passes out and slumps against his shoulder.)
Joey  (Checks to see if shes drooling on his shirt.) Okay. Okay, okay,
hey. (Lays her down and covers her with a blanket.) There we go, lets get your feet
up there. (Looks at her) Good night, Kate. Sweet dreams. (Picks up a garbage can) Im
gonna put this can right here in case you have to hurl.
[Scene  Monica and Rachel's, the next morning, Phoebe is STILL on hold.]
Hold Voice  Please stay on the line. Youre call is very important to us.
Monica  (entering from her bedroom) Pheebs, youve been up for 24 hours! Go
to sleep, honey. Th-this isnt healthy.
Phoebe  No, no, Im fine, and yknow why? Cause of all the
riboflavin.
Joey  (entering, happily) Hey!
Monica  Hey! Didnt you have that outfit on last night?
Joey  Yeah! I stayed at Kates, but ah, nothing happened. Hey, Pheebs,
where were ya?
Phoebe  Im so, so, so sorry, Joey. I definitely am gonna see youre
play. I swear youre play is very important to us, thank you for your patience.
Youre play is the next play is the next play Im gonna see.
Monica  Anyway, how did it go with Kate?
Joey  Oh, it was great! Yeah, I-I walked her home, and it was amazing how much
we connected, y'know? Then ah, then she passed out, but then she woke up. Yeah? And we
stayed up all night talking, and now were like totally crazy about each other!
Monica  Joey, you had the night!
Joey  What?
Monica  When two people finally realise their feelings for each other, and-and
they talk for hours, and they-they learn all about the other person!
Joey  You-you think?
Monica  Did you like learn about her family?
Joey  Two brothers, one died!
Monica  Yes!!
Joey  Yeah?!
Monica  Oh! (They hug, triumphantly.)
[Scene  Central Perk, Chandler and Monica are sitting on the couch, Rachel is on the
chair.]
Gunther  (bringing Chandler a cup) This is from the woman at the bar.
Chandler  Oh-ho-ho-ho.
Gunther  Sorry. She thought you were somebody else.
Rachel  What time is it?
Monica  One.
Ross  One.
Rachel  Tommys supposed to be here soon, were going to lunch.
Ross  Look. Look, I wasnt going to say anything to you, but... All right,
I dont think you should be seeing Tommy anymore.
Rachel  You dont?!
Ross  No! The guy is mean. I mean really mean. I think you should stay away from
him.
Rachel  Umm, or, maybe, I should stay away from all men.
Ross  No, its not just cause Im jealous. (Both Monica and
Chandler give him a Come on look) I mean Im not, Im not, Im
not jealous, okay? Its Look, the guy, he screamed, he actually screamed at
this couple sitting in our seats.
Chandler  Yeah, and at the end of the play, he, he got up y'know, and he just
started like, (claps his hands) banging his hands together!
Ross  Okay, fine, fine. You dont want to believe me? No, thats fine.
(starts to leave)
Monica  Were kidding!
Chandler  Ross, dont. Ross!
Ross  You dont want to believe me, Im Mr. Funny to you. Mr.
Funny (turns around and almost spills his coffee on Tommy)
Tommy  Whoa!!
Ross  Whoa, sorry Tommy.
Tommy  Whats in the cup, Ross?
Ross  Umm
Tommy  What is in the cup?!
Ross  Okay, its coffee.
Tommy  Ice coffee? Tell me its ice coffee!
Ross  Its-its hot
Tommy  Hot coffee!!! You idiot!! You were gonna spill hot coffee all over me,
huh?!! What are you just some big, dumb, stupid, doofy idiot, with a doofy idiot hairdo,
huh?! Huh?!
Rachel  (not seeing Ross) Whats your favourite thing about summertime?
Monica  Umm, going to the beach. When it stays light real late.
Rachel  Yeah
Tommy  (entering, finished with yelling at Ross, who follows him in shell
shocked) (happily) Hey!
Rachel  Tommyyyy! Say, whats your favourite thing about summer?
Tommy  Ooh, I dont know. Probably the smell of freshly cut grass.
Chandler  Ohh, thats a good one.
[Scene  Backstage at Joeys play, Joey is arriving, late.]
Joey  Sorry! Sorry, Im late; sorry, Im late! My duck and my chick
and a fight, it-it was ugly.
Stage Manager  Look, we held the curtain for you buddy. Come on, lets go!
Lets go!
Lauren  (answering the door) Vic! Where have you been, baby?!
Joey  (surprised its Lauren) (hugs her) (whispering) Wheres Kate?
Lauren  (whispering) She got a job in L.A.
Joey  (stunned) What?!
Lauren  Ive been waiting up all night for ya. Where have you been? (Joey
doesnt answer) Where have you been? Vic?!
Joey  Oh, ahh, go to the window. Im wanna run down to the truck and show
you something.
Lauren  (at the window, shes looking down out of the window) What do you
got down there, Vic? What do you got under that tarp?
Joey  (grabs the window from the outside and sticks his head in) (whispering)
When is she leaving?
Lauren  (whispering) Tonight. What are you doing?
Joey  (making like he is yelling up to the second floor) Im coming up!
[Scene  Monica and Rachel's, Chandler and Ross are in the kitchen, Rachel and Monica
are sitting in the living room, and Phoebe is, you guessed it, still on hold.]
Tommy  Hey, mind if I use the phone?
Phoebe  Oh, I (starts jabbering incoherently)
Chandler  Why dont you use ours across the hall, cause
shehasproblems.
Ross  (coming out of the kitchen with a cup of coffee, almost running into
Tommy) Oh-ho, whoa! Sorry, Tommy. I almost spilled this hot coffee on you.
Tommy  Yeah, but you didnt.
Ross  No, but its-its-its hot!
Rachel  Ross, would you just stop it! Its getting really old.
Ross  I cant believe no one believes me!
Phoebe  I do, I believe you.
Ross  You do Pheebs?
Phoebe  Yeah. But I also believed her (points to the phone) when she said I was
next.
Tommy  (noticing the chick) Ooh, hey! Hey, there little fella. (picks up the
chick) Mr. Fuzzy-Man, how are you doing? (starts to pet him) Aww. (The chick poops on his
hand.) Eww! Oh! Eww! Gross! Idiot!! Stupid little, fuzzy, yellow creature!! Oh look at me,
Im so cute, Im a little chick whos disgusting! God, youre so
stupid, how are you not yet extinct!! (the duck wattles behind him and quacks) (to the
duck) Quack-quack, quack-quack!! What are you quacking about?! Dumb Donald Doo-Doo!!
Chandler  Step away from the duck.
Tommy  Ooh, sorry little Mr. Chic-A-Dee, sorry you went doody in my hand!
(starts to walk out and stops) (to Rachel) Well, I guess were not going out anymore.
Whaa!!!
[Scene  Backstage at Joeys play, Joey is changing for the next scene as Kate
arrives, carrying her bags.]
Kate  Joey!
Joey  Hey!
Kate  Im soo glad I caught you, I couldnt find you before.
Joey  Wh-wh-whats going on? Wh-whats this about L.A.?
Kate  They still want me for General Hospital.
Joey  But, but wh-what about us?
Kate  Last night was wonderful. But I-I cant stay here just for you.
Joey  Well, so, stay for the museums!
Kate  Im sorry.
Stage Manager  Joey, onstage!
Joey  Well can you at least stay to the end of the play? I mean, Ill go to
the airport with ya, I-I wanna say good bye.
Lauren  (yelling from onstage) Where are you Vic?
Kate  Flights in an hour. I-I gotta go.
Lauren  Vic! Vic! Vic!!!
Joey  (to Lauren) In a minute!!
Lauren  So this is it? Victor?
Joey  Yeah, I guess it is. (sees Kate is watching, he turns Lauren so that he
can talk directly to Kate, but still look like he is talking to Lauren) Listen, I ah, I
gotta say good bye, and-and I gotta say it quick cause this is killing me. One thing
you gotta know, is that I will never forget you. But, youve got things you have to
do now, and so do I. And so Im gonna get on this spaceship, (smoke starts
pouring in from the ceiling, and a ladder comes down, with flashing, colored lights on the
side of it) and Im gonna go to Blargon 7 in search of alternative fuels. But when I
return, 200 years from now, youll be long gone. But I wont have aged at all.
(gets on the ladder) So you tell your great-great-granddaughter to look me up, because
Adrienne, baby, Im gonna want to meet her.
Lauren  So long, Vic! (waving good bye as the ladder retracts)
[Scene  Monica and Rachel's, the gang, except Joey, is there. Phoebe is, well you
y'know.]
Monica  Phoebe, its been two days.
Phoebe  Yeah, I know. Oh, good thing its one of those 801 numbers. Right?
Ross  Phoebe, 800 is toll free, 801 is-is Utah.
Phoebe  No, no, no, oh no-no-no, its has to be 800. (picks up the
instruction manual to check the phone number) Cause all those big companies have 800
numbers, every one. (Finds the number) Yeah, every big Utah-based company has one.
Rachel  Phoe-be!!
Phoebe  Sorry, Im so sorry, I will pay you back.
Chandler  And yet, shes still not hanging up the phone.
All  Hang it up! Hang up the phone!!
Phoebe  Fine! Fine! (slams the phone down, breaking it) Oh-oh!
Monica  What?
Phoebe  Well, I think I broke it. But thats all right, heres the
number you can call.
Monica  (sarcastic) Oh.
[Scene  Chandler and Joey's, Chandler and Joey are playing with the duck and the
chick.]
Joey  Hey, wouldn't be cool if our duck and chick had a little baby? We could
call it Chuck.
Chandler  Or... Dick.
Ross  (entering) Hey.
Chandler and Joey  Hey.
Ross  Listen, I-I need a favor. Umm, I was in the shower, and as I was cleansing
myself, I ah, I-I, well I felt something.
Chandler  Was it like a sneeze only better?
Ross  No, no, I mean, I mean a thing on my body.
Joey  (with a disgusted look) What was it?
Ross  Well, I don't know, it's-it's kinda in a place that's not... It's not
visually accessible to me, and I was hoping maybe you guys could-could help me out.
(starts to take off his pants)
Chandler and Joey  Whoa!!!
Chandler  No!!
Ross  Come on you guys, it's no big deal! (He turns around and shows him his
thing.)
Chandler  Whoa-heeeiiiiii-iiiii-ah!! (sees it) Huh.
Ross  Well what is it? Is it a mole? (He moves closer to them, and they jump
back.)
Joey  No, it's too wrinkly to be a mole.
Ross  Well, eww. What? Is it a pimple?
Chandler  No, it's... fancier than a pimple. Look Ross, why don't you just go
see a
Rachel  (entering, interrupting them) Hey guys! What's... (sees what they're
doing and stops, the guys are stunned)
Chandler  Okay, well, it's definite, two more weeks of winter.
Ross  Ahhh.
Joey  Yeah, right.
[Scene  Central Perk, Chandler, Joey, and Rachel are there, as Phoebe enters with her
date.]
Phoebe  (to her date) Okay, and then this is the coffee house. This is where I
play my music. (points to the stage)
Vince  Good deal.
Phoebe  Yeah, and these are my friends. People. This is Vince, Vince the people.
Rachel  Hi!
Chandler  Hey!
Vince  Hey!
Phoebe  Vince is a fireman.
Rachel  Wow! Have you ever rescued anyone from a burning building before?
Vince  98 hot saves, highest in the force.
Chandler  Well, y'know if Joey and I played with matches we could get you up to
an even hundred.
Vince  (dead serious) Fire safety is not a joke, son.
Chandler  You're right, I know.
Vince  (to Phoebe) Look, I gotta go. I'm on call tonight. (kisses her) See you
Saturday. (leaves)
Phoebe  Okay. (watches him leave)
Rachel  Wow, he's cute, Pheebs! But I thought you just started dating that
Kindergarten teacher.
Phoebe  Oh, Jason? Yeah, uh-huh, we're seeing each other tonight.
Rachel  What-Pheebs?! Two dates in one day? That's so unlike you.
Phoebe  I know, I know! I'm like playing the field. Y'know? Like, juggling two
guys, I'm sowing my wild oats. Y'know? Y'know, this kind've like y'know oat-sowin',
field-playin' juggler.
Joey  So Pheebs, do they know about each other?
Phoebe  Does a dog's lips move when he reads? (Joey makes an `I don't know'
face, and looks to Chandler and Rachel, who're also stumped) Okay, no they don't.
Ross  (entering) Hey guys!
Joey  Hey.
Rachel  Hi!
Joey  (going over to him) Well?!
Chandler  (joining them) Okay, how'd it go at the doctor's?
Ross  Well, he said there's definitely nothing to worry about, it's totally
benign.
Joey  Well what is it?!
Ross  He couldn't even tell me! He said it was just some sort of skin...
abnormality. And the worst thing is he-he-he said, he said, without being able to identify
it, he was reluctant to remove it.
Chandler  Y'know what? You should go to my guy, because when I went in there
with my third nipple. He just lopped it right off. Y'know? So I guess I'm lucky. I mean
not as lucky as people who were born with two nipples.
Ross  At least they knew what yours was. Y'know, yours had a name.
Joey  Oh! Maybe they'll name yours after you! Y'know, they'll call it, The Ross.
And then people would be like, "Awww, he's got a Ross."
Ross  (sarcastic) Yeah, that'd be cool!
Monica  Pete's breaking up with me.
All  What?!
Monica  I just checked my messages, and he said that when he gets back from
Atlanta, we need to talk.
Rachel  And?
Monica  Well that's it. People never say `We need to talk' unless it's something
bad.
Joey  Whoa, that doesn't necessarily mean that he's breaking up with you.
Monica  Really?!
Joey  Yeah, maybe he just cheated on you.
[Scene  A Street, Phoebe is walking with her second date, Jason.]
Jason  ...and I know I'll never miss doing it, but I gotta tell you, it's pretty
cool knowing that you're making a difference in a kid's life.
Phoebe  That is so great! Oh, I... (sees that a parked car near them has caught
on fire) Oh my God!
Jason  Whoa!
Phoebe  (the fire has worsened) Oh my God!!!
Jason  Ahh-ahh, we'd better call the fire department!
Phoebe  (stopping him) No! No!
Jason  No, no?
Phoebe  Well, we don't n-n-n-n-need a fireman, we'd, we'd like a good mechanic.
(hears the sound of approaching sirens) Oh my God, here they come! Well, we gotta get out
of here!
Jason  W-w-w-wait! Why?!
Phoebe  Well look, if I wanted to see a fireman, I would date one. Okay? (she
drags him away)
[Scene  A Doctor's Office, Ross is having his thing looked at by Dr. Rhodes.]
Ross  Th-th-that's all it is, a third nipple. Y'know? Just your run-of-the-mill
third nipple. Y'know? You can take it off. Just slice that baby right off!
Dr. Rhodes  Take your shirt off, and let's see what we're dealing with here.
(Ross starts to take off his pants) What are you doing?
Ross  Just showing you my run-of-the-mill-slice-it-right-off third nipple.
Dr. Rhodes  Well that's not a third nipple.
Ross  No?
Dr. Rhodes  First of all, it's on your ass.
Ross  Well then, what is it?!
Dr. Rhodes  Wait a minute, hold it. (He goes to the door and opens it.) Johnson!
Will you come in here a moment?
Dr. Johnson  I'm with Hamilton!
Dr. Rhodes  He's good with rear things, bring him in too.
[Scene  Central Perk, Chandler, Monica, and Joey are there.]
Monica  (starting to get up) I gotta go water Pete's plants. (stops) Y'know
what, if he's gonna break up with me, maybe I won't water his plants.
Chandler  Well, if he's gonna break up with you, maybe Joey and I should water
his plants. If y'know what I mean.
Joey  Or ha-ha, we could go over there and pee on them.
Phoebe  (entering with Rachel) and I-I can't take it! Y'know? I'm just,
always afraid one of them is gonna catch me with the other one. It's making me crazy.
Rachel  Well honey, then why don't you break up with one of them?
Phoebe  (disgusted) Uh.
Joey  Whoa-whoa-whoa. What ah, what happened to playing the field?
Phoebe  Well, it just, it doesn't feel like playing anymore, it feels like work.
It's like I'm working in the field.
Rachel  So Pheebs, pick one of them.
Monica  Yeah. Which one do you like more?
Phoebe  Well, Vince is great, y'know `cause, he's like a guy, guy. Y'know? He's
so burly, he's sooo very burly. (giggles)
Joey  Okay, good, so there you go. Go with Vince.
Phoebe  Yeah, but Jason's really sensitive.
Chandler  Well sensitive is important, pick him.
Phoebe  Yeah.
Joey  Oh sure, go with the sissy.
Phoebe  Jason is not a sissy!
Joey  Oh no-no-no-no, I meant Chandler.
[Scene  Dr. Rhodes's Office, a rather large group of doctors has now gathered to take a
look at Ross's thing. Ross is none too pleased with the developments, he has a disgusted
look on his face.]
Ross  Y'know I have dinner plans!!
Dr. Rhodes  Thank you soo much for coming on such a short notice. Ladies and
gentlemen, I've-I've-I've been practicing medicine for twenty-three years, and I'm
stumped.
All  Whoa. (they all lean in to get a closer look, Ross isn't pleased)
[Scene  Pete's apartment, Monica is there to water the plants, and is showing the gang
around.]
Monica  Okay, this is the den. All right, check this out. Lights! (the lights
turn on automatically, but are very bright) Whoa! All right. Less lights! Bad lights!
Lights go away! (they dim) Oh, see you just need to find the right command.
Ross  Yes, and the dimmer switch.
Joey  Whoa! For a rich guy he's got, that's a pretty small TV.
Monica  No-no-no, that's a video-phone. But hey guys you're not supposed to be
here, so please, do not touch anything.
Chandler  (sitting down on the couch) I-kea! This is comfortable.
Rachel  (entering with Phoebe) This place is amazing.
Phoebe  God, that is the nicest kitchen.
Monica  I know.
Phoebe  No! But it's the nicest kitchen, the refrigerator told me to have a
great day.
Joey  Look at this! A millionaire's checkbook.
Monica  Joey, put that down! (the phone rings) Oh my God! It's Pete. Okay, get
out!! How the hell do you answer a video-phone! (steps in front of it, and automatically
answers it)
Pete  Monica? (the gang ducks and hides)
Monica  I guess that's how.
Pete  Hey Monica, how's it going.
Monica  Oh its umm, good! It's umm, its good, just here watering the
plants.
Pete  Well don't forget that fiches over there by Rachel.
Rachel  (standing up) Ahh... Chandler's on the couch!!
Pete  I see him, you guys are just the worst hiders ever.
All  (standing up) Hey Pete.
Joey  Hi, how ya doing?
Monica  Ahh, Pete, the other day when you said you needed to talk, umm, just so
I know, is it good news or bad news.
Pete  Oh, it's good news. No, it's definitely good news. Hold on a second, I
have another call. (clicks his remote) (to his other call) Hey, how's it going?
Monica  Oh no-no-no, it's still me.
Pete  Ah, no it's not. I've got picture-in-picture here. (to other caller) Yeah.
(listens) Yeah, okay. I'm gonna have to call you back later. (pause) Monica? You. I'm
gonna have to call you back.
Monica  Oh, oh, okay umm, so I'll see you soon.
Pete  Okay, I love you.
Monica  I love you.
All  I love you, love you.
Monica  Okay. Well, it's good news. It's good news.
Chandler  So, what do you thing the good news is?
Joey  (looking at the checkbook) Wow! Look at this! He wrote a check for 50,000
dollars to Hugo Ligrens Ring Design. (Monica is stunned) Oh, sorry, what do you think the
good news is?
Monica  Oh my.
Rachel  Monica's gonna marry a millionaire!!!
Ross  Hey, you gotta get Mom on the phone. Call Mom! Call Mom!
Pete's Mom  Hello.
Monica  And that's Pete's Mom.
[Scene  Monica and Rachel's, the gang is returning from Petes.]
Rachel  Mon you definitely have to make it a theme wedding, and the theme could
be, Look how much money weve got! Y'know, I mean you could put, you
could put money in-in the invitations! You-you could have like little money place
settings. And ah, you could start with a money salad! I mean itll be dry, but people
will like it.
Monica  Would you stop? Weve only been going out a couple of weeks, I mean
we dont even know if hes gonna propose.
Chandler  Yes, but this is Pete. Okay? Hes not like other people, on your
first date he took you to Rome. For most guys thats like a third or fourth date
kinda thing.
Monica  Well if-if thats what it is, then its-its crazy.
Ross  Monicas right. Were talking about getting married here. Okay?
She-she cant just rush into this.
Rachel  Oh please, what do you know! You married a lesbian!
Phoebe  All right. I gotta go. I have break up with Vince.
Chandler  Oh, so youre going with the teacher, huh?
Phoebe  Yeah, I like Vince a lot, y'know? But, its just Jasons so
sensitive, y'know? And in the long run, I think sensitive its just better than
having just like a really, really, really nice (pause) butt. (Her eyes glaze over thinking
about the butt.) (pause) Jason! Definitely Jason! Okay, wish me luck!
All  Good luck!
Rachel  OH MY GOD!!! (She holds her hands up in triumph and the gang all look at
her.) Sorry, I was just imagining what itd be like to catch the money bouquet.
[Scene  A Fire House, Phoebe has gone to break up with Vince.]
Phoebe  Excuse me. Umm, is Vince here?
Fireman  Oh sure. Vince?!
Vince  Yo!! (slides down that pole that fire stations have)
Phoebe  Wow! I didnt know you guys actually used those.
Vince  So, whats up?
Phoebe  Umm, wow. This-this isnt gonna be easy. Umm, I dont think we
should see each other anymore.
Vince  Uh-huh. G-good deal.
Phoebe  Im sorry.
Vince  No-no its okay. Its just that ah, I thought we had something
pretty special here. And y'know I-I felt like you were someone I could finally open up to,
and (starts choking up) That theres so much in me I have to share with you
yet.
Phoebe  Oh my God, I didnt
Vince  (starting to cry) Im sorry, I cant talk. Im gonna go
write in my journal. (walks away)
Phoebe  (running after him) Wait-wait-wait! Wait!!
[Scene  Central Perk, Phoebe, Ross, and Monica are there.]
Phoebe  (to Ross) Im telling you, if you want to take care of that thing,
you should go to my herbal guy.
Ross  Thank you, but I want to remove it Pheebs. I dont want to make it
savory.
Monica  Y'know when girls sleep with guys with weird things on their body, they
tell their friends about it.
Ross  Gimme this. (Grabs the herbalists card and leaves.)
Rachel  (entering) Hi! Okay, dont be mad at me, but I couldnt
resist.
Monica  Brides magazines?
Rachel  Yes, and I know that youd say no if he asked you, but Im
sorry; how great would you look walking down the aisle in this Donna Carin. (shows her the
picture.)
Phoebe  (gasps) Oh, you so would! Oh, you should get that anyway. (They both
look at her.) Like for clubbing.
Monica  It is so weird, I know what I said, but uh, this morning, I was lying in
bed I was, I was imagining what it would be like to say yes. (Rachel slams the magazine
shut in amazement.) I know its a little sudden, and its a little rushed, and
its totally not like me to do something like this, but that doesnt mean I
cant. Right? I mean Im-Im crazy about Pete, and I know that we want the
same things, and when I thought about saying yes, it made me really happy.
Rachel  Oh my God. (starting to cry)
Monica  I know. (pause) I need more pie. (goes and gets some)
Phoebe  Hey Mon umm, if you do get married, can I bring two guests?
Rachel  You didnt break up with that fireman?
Phoebe  No, that was my way of telling you. Well, it turns out hes
incredibly sensitive, he keeps a journal and he paints. He even showed me charcoal
drawings that he drew of me.
Rachel  Wow!
Phoebe  Yeah, well hed prefer water colors, but y'know, he has easy access
to a lot of charcoal.
Monica  So then, are you going to dump Jason?
Phoebe  Well, yeah, because I have to break up with someone, and Okay so
Jason is sensitive, (holds up one finger) but now sos Vince (holds up one finger on
her other hand) Plus, Vince has the body y'know? (holds up two more fingers on the Vince
side) So Its really just about the math.
[Scene  Jasons apartment, Phoebe has gone to break up with Jason.]
Phoebe  (knocks on the door) Jason?
Jason  Yeah, come on in.
Jason  So Phoebe, you ah, sounded kinda serious on the phone, is ah, is anything
wrong?
Phoebe  Nah-ha!
[Scene  Phoebes Herbal Guys office, Ross is there about his thing. Ross is
looking around the exam room, and he goes over to a large bank of drawers, pulls one out
and almost spills it as the herbalist, Guru Saj, enters.]
Guru Saj  You must be Ross.
Ross  Hi.
Guru Saj  I am Guru Saj. (takes the drawer back and replaces)
Ross  Listen, I got to tell you Ive-Ive never been to a guru before,
so...
Guru Saj  Well, relax. If it makes you feel better, Ive attended some of
the finest medical schools in Central America. Well then, lets take a look at this
skin abnormality of yours. (motions to the table) Come on, have a seat. (looks at it) Eeh,
huh. As I suspected, its a koondis!
Ross  Whats a koondis?
Guru Saj  I dont know, whats a koondis with you? (starts laughing as
if that joke was funny, Ross only looks at him, and he stops) Please, lie down! Ive
got a sav that oughta shrink that right up.
Ross  I guess its worth a try.
Guru Saj  Oh sure, we should see resultsWhoa!! Clearly not the way to go!!
(quickly wipes it off)
Ross  What?! What?!
Guru Saj  We appear to have angered it.
Ross  We?! We angered it?!
Guru Saj  Oh, I think I see the problem. And Im afraid were gonna
have to use a much stronger tool. (Ross gives him a What? look) Love.
Ross  Oh God!
Guru Saj  (He starts moving his hands around in circles above the thing.) Ross,
there is absolutely no way this is going to come off unless you start to
Ross  Ow!!
Guru Saj  Oops.
Ross  What was, what was that?
Guru Saj  Well its gone.
Ross  What?! Hows that?
Guru Saj  It got caught on my watch.
Ross  Hey! (congratulates him)
[Scene  Petes apartment, Pete and Monica are coming back from a date.]
Pete  Lights. (The lights turn on, once again theyre too bright.) Uh,
romantic lights. (The lights dim.)
Monica  Ooh, nice.
Pete  So ah, there was this thing I wanted to talk to you about.
Monica  Oh, right! I completely forgot about that.
Pete  Well ah, Ive been doing a lot of thinking, and I look at my
life
Monica  Yeah?
Pete  And I feel like Ive conquered the business world, and I feel like
Ive conquered the intellectual world, and now I-I have the most beautiful woman in
the world.
Monica  Wow.
Pete  Theres one thing missing.
Monica  Whats that?
Pete  Its time for me to conquer the physical world.
Monica  Okay. (not sure of herself)
Pete  Monica, I want to become (pause) the Ultimate Fighting Champion.
Monica  You wanna what?!
Pete  I want to become the Ultimate Fighting Champion! Its the most
intense physical competition in the world, its banned in 49 states!
Monica  What are you talking about?
Pete  Okay, my trainer, Ho Chi, is teaching me a combination of Gee Koon Doe and
Brazilian street fighting, Ive even had my own octagon training ring designed.
Monica  And I suppose you used a ring designer for that.
Pete  Yeah. Monica, I want you there in the front row when I win. I want you
close enough to smell the blood. What do you think?
Monica  My parents will be so happy.
[Scene  Central Perk, Phoebes singing, Vince is also there.]
Phoebe  (singing) Crazy underwear, creepin up my butt. (Jason
enters) Crazy underwear, always in a rut. Crazy under-(sees Jason)-wear (In
her head) Oh No! What is he doing here? All right, just keep playing, just keep
playing. Youll get through this; youll be fine. (She tries to continue the
song, but she has lost the ability to pronounce words, and the lyrics come out as
gibberish.) (giving up on the song) Okay, thank you. And, as always no one talk to me
after the show.
Jason  (going up to her) Hey. I was
Phoebe  Hey!
Jason  I was passin by and I saw that you were playing tonight, its
kinda cool seeing you up there. (kisses her)
Vince  (running over) Whoa! Hey-hey! Whats going on here? Who is this guy?
Phoebe  I dont know, he just started kissing me. Get him! Get him, Vince!
Vince  What?!
Jason  What?!
Phoebe  Yeah, okay, Ive-Ive been dating both of you, and its
been really horrible. Cause y'know its been a lot of fun, for me. Umm, but I-I
like you both, and I, and I didnt know how to chose, so... Im sorry, Im
just, Im terrible, Im a terrible person. Im terrible.
Vince  Phoebe, Phoebe relax, its okay. I mean we never said this was
exclusive.
Jason  Yeah, and neither did we. Give yourself a break.
Phoebe  Really?!
Jason  Yeah. I mean y'know, we havent been going out that long.
Come on, we havent even slept together yet. Huh.
Vince  You havent?
Jason  You have?
Phoebe  Well, this is none of my business. (starts to walk away)
Jason  (to Phoebe) I-I cant believe this! You-youve slept with him?!
Phoebe  Well, I made you a candle light dinner in the park.
Jason  Y'know Phoebe, Im gonna make this real easy for you. (walks out)
Phoebe  (to Vince) Well, that couldve been really awkward.
Vince  You made him a candle light dinner in the park?
Phoebe  Yeah, but I-I-I-I can do that for you, Im gonna do that for you.
Vince  Uh yeah, I cant believe I ever went out with somebody who would
actually have an open flame in the middle of a wooden area. (walks out)
Chandler  (comforting the duck) Everythings gonna be all right. Okay,
Dick?
Guru Saj  (entering) Hello, I am Guru Saj-(sees the duck)-Whoa!! (to Joey)
Thats supposed to be a duck right? Cause otherwise, this is waaay out of my
league.
Joey  Yeah, yeah. Hes got a, hes got a really bad cough, and our
vet, he cant do anything about it. Is there something you can do?
Guru Saj  Hmm, let me see. Let me see. Do you think you could get him to eat a
bat?

[Scene  Central Perk, the whole gang minus Monica is there.]
Chandler  Do you think that theres a town in Missouri or some place called
Sample? And ah, as youre driving into town theres-theres like a sign,
and it says Youre in Sample. (He says it like urine sample.)
Monica  (entering) Hey.
All  Hey!
Rachel  Howd it go with Pete?!
Joey  Tell us!
Monica  Youre not gonna believe this. Okay, so I go over...
Billy Crystal  Im sorry. Ex-excuse us. Im sorry, its a little
crowded. Do you mind if we... (motions to the couch)
Robin Williams  Yeah, could you scooch?
Billy  Yeah, move over just a little bit.
Robin  Keep on scooching.
Monica  So guys, listen, I go over there, and umm...
Robin  Why? Why?! Whats wrong with me?!
Billy  Whats the matter?
Robin  I have a feelin... I, my wife is sleeping with her gynaecologist.
Billy  How do you know?
Robin  Well y'know, hes got access.
Billy  Yeah.
Robin  Y'know its that feeling you get, y'know?
Billy  Like when you go bowling and you know youre in somebody elses
shoes?
Robin  Thats the one.
Phoebe  All right, so, so you went to Petes...
Ross  What happened?
Monica  (Robin is speaking loudly again) I...
Robin  Why is this happening to me?! I dont know, maybe its my
wound.
Monica  Forget it. (they all turn and listen to Billy and Robin)
Billy  So its-its not heeled yet?
Robin  No-no, its ooozing, oozing. (to Rachel) Could you pass me the
cream? Is there anyOh, theres the cream.
Billy  Thomas, this is gonna be hard, but I wanted it to come from me, and
nobody else.
Robin  What is it, Tim?
Billy  Its me, Ive been sleeping with your wife.
Joey  (to Billy) So youre the gynaecologist?
Billy  (to Joey) Hey, Im trying to have a private conversation! Is that
okay?!
Robin  (starting to cry) Ooh, (to Rachel) Can I have a napkin, please? Could you
please hand me a napkin? (Rachel tries to grab one, but is to slow for his tastes.) Would
you--Give me this thing (grabs the napkin holder from her.) all right!! Enough! (to Billy)
And you are no longer my friend! We are finished! (gets up to leave) Nada!! No more! You
are a bastard for doing this!! (Billy follows him) Get away from me!!
Billy  Thomas, come back here! (they both leave)
Phoebe  So Monica, what were you gonna tell us?
Monica  (pause) I have no idea.
[Scene  Central Perk, continued from earlier.]
Rachel  So, come on, what was the big news Pete wanted to tell you Mon?! Or
should I say Mrs. Monica Becker?
Phoebe  No-no-no oh, keep your name, dont take his name.
Monica  He didnt ask me to marry him.
All  Ohh.
Phoebe  Well then definately dont take his name.
Monica  He wanted to tell me hes gonna compete is some ultimate fighting
competition thingy.
The Guys  Pete?!
Rachel  Why?! What is it?
Monica  I dont know exactly. Its-its sorta like wrestling.
Phoebe  (intrigued) Oh?!
Monica  Yeah, but without the costumes.
Phoebe  (disappointed) Oh.
Joey  And its not fake, its totally brutal.
Monica  So you can like, bite, and pull peoples hair and stuff?
Ross  Yeah, anything goes, except ah, eye gouging and fish hooking.
Monica  Whats fish hooking?
Ross  Huh, whats fish hooking... (Joey sticks his finger in Rosss
mouth and pulls on his cheek, y'know like when you hook a fish.) (to Joey, sarcastic)
Thanks man, that would have been really hard to describe. What is that taste?
Joey  What? My hands are totally clean, I just gave the duck a bath.
[Scene  Chandlers office, he is just finishing a meeting with his boss.]
Doug  So thanks for the warm welcome. Its good to have you guys on my
team, and I come to play. I hope you do too. Now, lets go out there and get
em! Huh? And remember, there is no I in team.
Chandler  Yes, but theres two in martini, soo everybody back to my
office.
Doug  (to Chandler) You! Chuckles! Whats your name?
Chandler  Oh its Bing, sir. Im sorry , I was just ah...
Doug  No-no, I heard what you said, funny. I like funny. (Chandler starts to
leave) This team is about hard work, but its also about having fun. Good to have you
aboard Bing! (smacks him on the butt, and Chandler leaves shocked.)
[Scene  Monica and Rachel's, Ross is making reservations.]
Ross  (on phone) Thats right, Ryder. Wynona Ryder for six. (listens) Thank
you. (hangs up) (to the gang) Yeah, we have the reservations.
Rachel  Yes!!
Chandler  All right buddy, way to go! (smacks him on the butt)
Ross  (stunned) Dude, what are you doing?
Chandler  Thank you! Today, my boss keep slapping my butt and he was acting like
it was no big deal.
Phoebe  Yeesh, whatd you do about it?
Chandler  Well, I didnt do anything. I didnt want to be the guy who
has a problem with his boss slapping his bottom.
Monica  I gotta tell ya, I think its okay to be that guy.
Joey  Yeah, maybe its like y'know, that jock thing. Y'know how football
players pat each other after touchdowns. (pats Ross on the butt)
Rachel  Y'know I dont, I dont understand guys, I mean I-I would
never congratulate Monica on a great stew by y'know, grabbin her boob.
Chandler  Yeah, I know, for a really great stew you just y'know, stick your head
in between em.
Monica  Okay, can we please go eat?
Joey  Yeah. What are we getting?
Monica  (to Chandler) Anything but stew.
Ross  All right so, Chandler, from now on, dont give your boss a chance to
get you. Y'know just ah, dont turn your back to him.
Joey  Yeah, or you can teach him a lesson. Y'know? What you could do is you
could rub something that really smells on your butt, all right? Then, when he goes to
smack ya, his hand will smell. (thinking aloud) Now what could you rub on your butt that
would smell bad?
Chandler  (to Ross and Monica) What if Joey were president?
Phoebe  Umm, hey Rach, can I ask you something?
Rachel  Yeah.
Phoebe  Okay, you can totally say no, but umm, would it be okay with you if I
set Ross up on a date?
Rachel  Oh, ah with who?
Phoebe  Umm, my friend, Bonnie. She just always thought Ross was really cute,
and now that you two arent together, she asked if I could set it up, but if
youre not cool with it...
Rachel  Oh-oh-oh, which one is Bonnie again?
Phoebe  You remember her from my birthday party two years ago. Shes yeah,
like, average height, medium build, bald...
Rachel  Oh! (laughs) Thats fine.
Phoebe  Great! Okay, good for you! (as they leave she slaps Rachel on the butt)
[Scene  A Gym, Pete is training for the Ultimate Fighting Championship, with his
trainer, Hoshi.]
Hoshi  You are iron. You are steel! Let me ask you something, how come when I
call your computer support line, I have to wait an hour and a half?
Pete  I told you, were adding new operators all the time. Could we
concentrate on my training?
Hoshi  Its just hard when I know I have e-mail I cant get!
Monica  (entering) Hi!
Pete  Monica! (runs over and kisses her) Hi honey.
Hoshi  All right, on the table. (Pete gets on the table for his rubdown)
Monica  Hey, umm, so listen umm, my friends were telling me a little about this
ah, ultimate fighting thing and it, well it sounds really dangerous. I-I dont want
you to get hurt, cause I kinda like you.
Pete  Oh, believe me, I dont want to get hurt either. Im being smart
about this. See these guys? Theyre the best trainers in the world, and Hoshi here
used to be a paid assassin. (Hoshi yells at him in Chinese) A house painter! He used to be
a house painter.
Monica  Promise me youll be careful.
Pete  I promise.
Monica  Hey, are we still on for tonight?
Pete  Yeah.
Monica  Okay, good, cause umm, well maybe we could have a little workout
of our own...
Hoshi  No! No boom-boom before big fight!
Monica  How bout just a boom?
[Scene  Central Perk, Phoebe is there with Bonnie, as Rachel enters.]
Rachel  (to Phoebe) Well that was depressing, I think I just bought a soft
pretzel from one of the kids from Fame. Ready to go to the movies?
Phoebe  Um-hmm. Oh wait! This is Bonnie. (who has hair by the way)
Bonnie  Hi!
Rachel  This is Bonnie? (to Phoebe) This is Bonnie? (to Bonnie) Youre
Bonnie?
Bonnie  I can show you an ID if you want?
Rachel  Oh no, Im sorry, you look a lot different from the last time I-I
saw you.
Bonnie  Oh yeah, well I just started wearing bras again.
Rachel  Oh, that must be it.
Phoebe  (to Bonnie) Well I hope you have fun tonight.
Bonnie  Thanks! You too.
Rachel  (to Phoebe) You said she was bald.
Phoebe  Yeah, she was bald, shes not now.
Rachel  How could you not tell me that she has hair?
Phoebe  I dont know, I hardly ever say that about people.
Rachel  (looks in the window) Ohh, well, this is just perfect!
Phoebe  Well Im sorry, I thought you said it was okay.
Rachel  Yeah, I said what was okay when I thought she was some weird bald chick.
I mean, y'know, that girl has hair got all over head!
Phoebe  Well, maybe it wont work out. Maybe Ross wont like her
personality.
Rachel  Why, does she have a bad personality?
Phoebe  Oh no, Bonnies the best!
[Scene  Chandlers office, Chandler is bent over getting some water as his boss
approaches.]
Doug  Bing! (Chandler stands bolt upright and turns around to face him.) Read
your Computech proposal, a real homerun. (He goes to slap his butt, but Chandler slides
over making him miss.) Ooh. Barely got ya that time, get over here. Come on. (Chandler
goes over) Wham! (slaps him on the butt) Good one. That was a good one. (to a couple of
Chandlers co-workers) Keep at it team. (goes into his office)
Chandler  (to his co-workers) What is with him?
Phil  With him? Youre is favourite, youre his guy!
Stevens  We never get smacked.
Chandler  Well, thats not true, he-he smacked you once.
Phil  Not on purpose, he ricocheted of you and got me.
Stevens  Im telling you, I need some smacks. I got a kid starting
Dartmouth in the fall.
Doug  (coming out of his office) Dartmouth? Who went to Dartmouth? Dartmouth
sucks. Did you go to Dartmouth Bing?
Chandler  No sir.
Doug  There you go. (smacks him on the butt)
[Scene  The Ultimate Fighting Championship, Ross and Monica are there watching Pete.]
Ross  (walking up with this huge tub-o-popcorn and drink) Hey!
Monica  God Ross, what is that?
Ross  Yeah, its the Ultimate Fighting Combo. Yeah, I saved thirty cents,
plus I get to keep the cup. Yay!!
Announcer  From New York City, New York! Appearing in his Ultimate Fighting
Championship debut! Hes known for his confrontational business style. Ladies and
Gentlemen, introducing Pete Beck-errrr!!
Monica  I love you, Pete!!!
Announcer  And his opponent, from Hunnington Beach, California! Hes a 300
pound street fighter, Tank Abbottttttt!!!!
Monica  (going up to the ring) Pete! Pete!! That guys pretty huge!
Pete  Dont worry, Hoshi taught me how to use an opponents strength
and weight against him.
Ross  Well, then that guy is in serious, serious trouble.
Ross  All right! You go get him! Lets go!
Referee  Here we go gentlemen, here we go! (to Tank Abbott) Are you ready? (He
nods, and takes out his teeth) (to Pete) Are you ready? (Pete nods, Yes.)
Lets get it on!!
Pete  Uh-oh.
[Scene  The Arena, after the fight. Monica is walking up to a defeated Pete.]
Monica  Hey! (she sits down next to him) Its me. Mon-i-ca! Can I just tell
you how proud I am of you.
Pete  It would be nice after hearing 20,000 people chant You suck!
Monica  I mean I-I thought you were nuts at first, but you-you did it. And now
you can just look back at this thing with no regrets.
Pete  What, look back?
Monica  Well, youre not gonna get going are you?
Pete  Well let me ask you a question. Am I the Ultimate Fighting Champion?
Monica  Well, no. But...
Pete  Well Im not gonna stop until Im the Ultimate Fighting
Champion.
Monica  That guy stood on your neck until you passed out!
Pete  Let me tell you a story. When I set out to create Moss 865, do you think
it just happened overnight? No. There was Moss 1, that burnt down my Dads garage,
there was Moss 2 that would only schedule appointments in January, and 862 others that I
learned from, just like I learned from this fight, never to let a guy stand on my neck.
Monica  You didnt know that already?
Pete  Look, Im gonna get better. Okay? I promise you.
Monica  Okay, just get a lot better. (pause) Fast.
Pete  Oh, one other thing. Hoshi thinks that you being ringside may have
affected my concentration.
Monica  Yeah. That-that was the problem.
[Scene  Monica and Rachel's balcony, Ross and Phoebe are grilling some burgers and hot
dogs.]
Monica  (joining them) Hey.
Ross  Hey! How long until Petes fight?
Monica  Oh, about five minutes. Right now theyre interviewing his
opponent. Apparently he trains by going to Iran and pulling the arms off thieves.
Ross  Hot dog?
Monica  Four, please. (Ross looks at her) Im really nervous. (Ross gives
her the four dogs) Thank you. (she grabs four buns, and heads back inside)
Phoebe  So Ross, how umm, how did it go with Bonnie?
Ross  What? Oh! I gotta tell you, I-I wasnt expecting to like her at all,
I mean I actually wasnt expecting to like anyone right now, but shes really
terrific.
Phoebe  Ohh, thats too bad!
Ross  No, I-Im saying I liked her.
Phoebe  Yeah, y'know what, there are other fish in the sea.
Ross  Pheebs, I think shes great. Okay? Were going out again.
Phoebe  Okay, I hear you! Are you capable of talking about any thing else?
Chandler  (joining them) Hey! Which ones my turkey burger?
Ross  Ahh, the one next to my foot. Sorry.
Joey  (sticking his head out the window) Hey, the fights starting!
Ross  Okay, well be right in. (to Chandler) So ah, did your boss try to
slap you again today?
Chandler  Nine times! Okay, I had to put on lotion! But, its gonna be
okay, because as of tomorrow Im conducting an experiment, and if all goes as
planned, my butt will be smack free.
Joey  (sticking his head out the window) Fights over!
[Scene  Chandlers office, Chandler is confronting his boss about the butt
smacking thing. His boss is writing on a white board.]
Chandler  Excuse me, Doug? (no reaction) Hey there sports fan!!
Doug  (turning around) Bing! You got those numbers for me?
Chandler  No, I ah, I didnt do them.
Doug  Oh, you forgot?
Chandler  No, no I just ah, didnt do them. Instead, I ah, hung out with a
couple of friends and had a couple of beers so I certainly dont deserve any praise,
verbal or otherwise.
Doug  Well, I got tanked myself last night. Pretty dicey drive home, Tapanzi
Bridge never looked smaller. (laughs) Thats okay, youre still my number one
guy! (slaps him on the butt) Bing!
Chandler  Doug!!
Doug  Hmm.
Chandler  Im a little bit uncomfortable with the that way you express
yourself.
Doug  Oh, is it the swearing? I mean is it the constant swearing? Because I
gotta tell ya, if it is, you can just... kiss my ass!
Chandler  No, no. It-its not about the swearing, its more about ah,
the way, that you ah, occasionally, concentrate, your enthusiasm on my buttock.
Doug  Oh?
Chandler  Oh, and dont get me wrong, I appreciate the sentiment. Its
just that I, I have a rather, sensitive posterior, and ah, besides, its making all
the other guys jealous.
Doug  Well, say no more. Y'know it takes guts to bring this up. Bing!
Youre okay.
Chandler  Okay. (he starts to leave)
Doug  Ha! (goes to smack him on the butt, but stops, faking Chandler out)
Ahhhhhhh!
Chandler  Ahhhhh! (walks out, imitating shooting himself in the head)
[Scene  The street outside Central Perk, Rachel and Phoebe are talking and walking.]
Phoebe  Okay. Would you rather live in the shirt pocket of a sweaty giant, or
inside his shower drain?
Rachel  (seeing Ross and Bonnie inside Central Perk) Oh my God! Phoebe look,
its Ross and that girl.
Phoebe  No! No! Look at that! (drags her away from the window) Its a line
of ants! Theyre working as a team!
Rachel  Phoebe! (goes back to the window)
Phoebe  (looking in the window) Right, oh yeah. Wow, oh, it looks like Ross is
breaking up with her. Uff, I hope he lets her down easy. Lets go.
Rachel  Come on Phoebe, look at that! They are not breaking up, look at them.
Okay thats, you know what that is? That is a, that is a second date, thats
what that is! Look at that, she just put her hand on his thigh...
Phoebe  Oh no! That really is nothing, she is very sexually aggressive.
Rachel  Ohh! (walking away from the window) Phoebe, this is all your fault! Now
he loves her, hes gonna marry her, and this is all your fault.
Phoebe  You said it was okay!
Rachel  You said she was bald!!
Phoebe  What?! What-what-what-what-what?!!
Rachel  Phoebe, we cant, we just cant just let it happen! Okay, we
have to do something! We have to break them up! Okay? Just go in there and like, shave her
head! You owe me one bald girl!!
Phoebe  Okay, first of all, breathe. Second of all, I dont get it.
Arent you the one that decided that you didnt want to be with Ross?
Rachel  (quietly) Yes.
Phoebe  Well isnt he your friend? Dont you want him to be happy?
Rachel  Yes.
Phoebe  So?
Rachel  I just y'know, I didnt expect him to be this happy so soon. Ufff.
Ooo-ooh! (sits down on the curb)
Phoebe  (sits down next to her and hugs her) Oh no.
Rachel  What?
Phoebe  Oh, we killed them all.
Rachel  Oh!
[Scene  A locker room, Pete is in a full upper-body cast. Monica enters, sees him, and
gasps. Pete tries to turn around, and winces in pain.]
Pete  Its okay, its not as bad as it looks, its a precaution.
Ah, Im not supposed to move my spine.
Monica  Please tell me youre stopping now.
Pete  Im fine! Id fight tonight, if theyd let me. (stands up
and starts swinging his arms) See this circle Im marking off here? This is my zone
of terror.
Monica  You are insane! You-you gotta give this up!
Pete  I cant until Im the ultimate fighter. I will do it. Im
telling you, the day will come when children will argue over who will win a fight, me or
Superman. Now, Im not saying I could beat Superman, but y'know, kids are stupid.
Monica  Sit down. All right? Please, just listen to me. You are terrible at
this! Okay? You are the worst ultimate fighter ever! Ever!!
Pete  Y'know I have a torn rotator cuff, a hairline fracture in my right
forearm, and a severely bruised Adams Apple, but that really hurt.
Monica  Well then, y'know what? I care about you to much to watch you hurt
yourself like this. So if you have to do this, then youre gonna have to do it
without me.
Pete  Well if youre asking me to quit, then youre asking me to be
someone Im not. Ive got to do this.
Monica  Then Ive gotta go. Bye. (kisses him and starts to walk out)
Pete  Mon-Monica?
Monica  Yes?
Pete  Could you leave a note? Cause Im on a lot of pain killers now,
and I dont know if Ill remember this tomorrow. (She leaves.)
[Scene  Chandlers office, he is just finishing up a meeting with his boss and the
rest of his team.]
Chandler  Thank you, sir.
Stevens  (coming back in) Oh, excuse me. I forgot my briefcase y'know, by
accident.
Doug  Of course, you did. Forgot something else too ya bastard! (smacks him on
the butt) (to Chandler) Well, what about you? Youre not feeling left out or anything
are ya?
Chandler  No. No, not at all, thats-thats ridiculous.
Doug  Everybody else got one, and you want one too. Dont you?
Chandler  Ye-ye-yeah, yes I do!
Doug  Now get on out of here, you! (smacks him on the butt)
[Scene  Monica and Rachel's, the gang is watching Pete fight on TV. Monica is hiding in
the kitchen, not watching.]
TV Announcer  Pete Becker is circling the ring now. It looks like, hes
just trying to feel him out. Oh, Bruiser is just...
Chandler  Run! Run you crazy, rich freak!
Rachel  Oh, I cant watch this. (turns her eyes away)
Joey  Check it out, hes winning! (to Monica) Petes winning!
Monica  Really?!
Joey  No-o-o!!
TV Announcer  Uh-oh, Bruiser has Becker on the canvas and is going for his
favourite area.
All  Oh! Oh! (they all recoil in horror)
Phoebe  Wait, if thats his favourite area, why is he being so mean to it?
Ross  Well, this is ironic. Of your last two boyfriends, Richard didnt
want to have kids, and from the looks of it, now Pete cant.
All  Ohh!! (they all start pointing at the screen)

[Scene  Central Perk, everyone except Phoebe is there. Bonnie is telling them of her
sex-capades.]
Chandler  (to Bonnie) So ah, your first sexual experience was with a woman?!
Bonnie  All right, I was 15, it was my best friend, Ruth, and we got drunk on
that hard cider, and then suddenly, I dont know, we were, we were making out.
Chandler  Tell it again. (pause, we see Rachel is not amused.) Seriously.
Rachel  (to Monica) I mean is that woman capable of talking about anything else
but sex?
Joey  Yeah, sure. Well y'know, earlier she was talking about geography.
Monica  Joey, she was listing the countries shes done it in.
Joey  Well, I think we all learned something.
Phoebe  (entering, hurridly) Hey, you guys! Look what I found! Look at this!
(She hands Chandler a picture) Thats my Moms writing! Look.
Chandler  (reading the back of the picture) Me and Frank and Phoebe, Graduation
1965.
Phoebe  Y'know what that means?
Joey  That youre actually 50?
Phoebe  No-no, thats not, thats not me Phoebe, thats
her pal Phoebe. According to her high school yearbook, they were like B.F.F. (Ross and
Bonnie look at her quizzically) Best Friends Forever.
All  Oh!
Rachel  That is so cool.
Phoebe  I know! So this woman probably could like have all kinds of stories
about my parents, and she might even know like where my Dad is. So I looked her up, and
she lives out by the beach. So maybe this weekend we could go to the beach?
All  Yeah! Yeah, we can!
Bonnie  (to Ross) Shoot! I cant go, I have to work!
Ross  Thats too bad.
Rachel  (sarcastic) Ohh, big, fat bummerrr.
Phoebe  So great! Okay! Tomorrow were gonna drive out to Montauk.
Joey  Hey, Bonnie had sex there!
[Scene  Outside Central Perk, Chandler and Monica are waiting for Phoebe to arrive with
the cab.]
Monica  (watching a happy couple walk by, arm in arm) Would you look at them. Am
I ever gonna find a boyfriend again? I gonna die an old maid.
Chandler  Youre not gonna die an old maid, maybe an old spinster cook.
Monica  (sarcastic) Thanks!
Chandler  Hey now besides, if worst comes to worst, Ill be your boyfriend.
Monica  Yeah right.
Chandler  Why is that so funny?
Monica  You made a joke right? So I laughed.
Chandler  Ha-ha-ha. A little to hard. What am I not ah, boyfriend material?
Monica  Well, no. Youre Chandler. Y'know, Chandler! (hits him on the arm)
Chandler  Okay, so weve established my name, and hit me. But theoretically
y'know, I mean say we werent friends, say its a blind date. I show up at your
door, and Im like (in a fake voice) Hey, nice to meet, ya. Hey, oh-hey.
Monica  Well Id probably be scared of a guy using a fake voice.
Joey  (walking up carrying a brown paper bag) Hey!
Monica  Oh, hey! Oh good, you brought food!
Joey  No, its just my luggage.
Chandler, Monica, and Joey  Hey!!
Joey  Woo-hoo! All right! Yeah!
Phoebe  Oh, I am having the best karma this week. First, I find this woman who
knew my parents, and then my client with the fuzzy back gives me his beach house.
Ross  Yeah? What about ah, that bike messenger you hit?
Phoebe  Oh, I wasnt talking about his karma.
Rachel  (approaching) Hey!
Chandler  Hey!
Joey  Hey-hey, check out the hat!
Chandler  What a minute, I know that hat! I was taken aboard that hat! They did
experiments on me! I cant have children!!
Monica  Seriously, where did you get the hat?
Rachel  Ross gave it to me.
Ross  Yeah, I think she looks good.
Rachel  Ohh, thank you.
Chandler  Buy it for ya, or win it for ya?
Rachel  Well excuse me, my fashion-impaired friends, I am here to tell you that
hats are back.
Phoebe  And this time, theyve ganged up to form one giant, super hat.
[Scene  At the Beach, its raining cats and dogs as the gang arrives. Chandler and
Monica are taking shelter under Rachels hat.]
Ross  Go, go, go!
Rachel  Oh yeah, now everybody wants to be under this hat!
Phoebe  Oy!!
Monica  Whats with all this sand? (picking a handful of sand off of the
floor, which is covered in sand)
Phoebe  Oh, yeah, Bob said there might be flood damage.
Ross  Yeah, either that, or he has a really big cat.
[Scene  Phoebe Sr. house, she is a real estate agent and is trying to sell a house over
the phone. By the way, its still raining outside.]
Phoebe Sr  Well, yes, its kindve an unusual house. It has umm, three
beautiful bedrooms and ah, no baths. But y'know, the ocean is right there.
Phoebe  (at the door) Knock, knock, knock.
Phoebe Sr  (on phone) Ah, oh, hang on a second. (to Phoebe) Come in, come in.
(on phone) All right, so think about it, and call me back. (hangs up)
Phoebe  (entering) Are you ah, Phoebe Abott?
Phoebe Sr  Ahh, yes.
Phoebe  Hi Phoebe Abott, Im your best friends daughter!
Phoebe Sr  Youre Erwins daughter?!
Phoebe  No, I-I mean your-your old best friend, here. (hands her the picture)
Lily, from high school. Remember?
Phoebe Sr  Oh gosh, Lily, yes. Of course I remember Lily. I... Then you must be?
Phoebe  (points to herself) Phoebe. (points to her) Phoebe. Phoebe, yeah. She
named me after you I guess.
Phoebe Sr  Uh-huh. Wow! Well, look! Theres Frank. (points to the picture.)
Phoebe  Yes!! Yes! Yes! Yes!! Thats my Dad, thats Frank! Yeah!
Im sorry Im getting all flingy.
Phoebe Sr  Take it easy--if you want, theres cookies on the counter, or,
or--sangria! (jumps up) I can make sangria!
Phoebe  No-no, sorry. Cookies are good, thanks.
Phoebe Sr  Oh.
Phoebe  (goes and gets some cookies) Well, so, umm, anyway umm, Ive been,
Ive been looking for my Father, and umm, have you heard from him, or seen him?
Phoebe Sr  Oh no, I-Im sorry, I guess we lost track of everybody after
high school.
Phoebe  (disappointed) Oh, okay. Well, so tell me everything about my parents.
Everything.
Phoebe Sr  Ohh, well. Y'know we were always together, in fact the had a nickname
for the three of us.
Phoebe  Oh, what? What was it?
Phoebe Sr  The three losers. Oh, poor Lily. (Phoebe notices a picture on the
fridge, takes it, and puts it in her pocket.) Ohh, y'know I-I heard about what happened,
that must have been just terrible for you, losing your mother that way.
Phoebe  (happily) Yeah, no, it was great.
[Scene  The beach house, its still raining. Chandler is building a sand castle,
Rachel is doing Monicas nails, and theyre all drinking margaritas, obviously
bored.]
Joey  (getting an idea) Hey, y'know what a really good rainy day game is?
Monica  What?!
Joey  I mean naked game. Strip poker, we should totally play strip poker.
All  No, no!
Monica  What are you crazy?!
Joey  Come on! When you go away, you-you have to play, its like a law!
Rachel  (to Monica) Allll done!
Monica  Aww, thank you.
Rachel  Okay, whos next?! (She looks around the room, and stops when she
comes to Ross.)
Ross  No-o-o! (Rachel gives him a Please? look.) No way!
Rachel  Come on, please?! Im boredddd! You let me do it once before.
Ross  Yeah well, if ah, if thats the rule this weekend... (She gets up)
No!
Rachel  Yes! (she starts creeping up on him)
Ross  Get away!
Rachel  Just once!
Ross  Stay away!
Rachel  Take it like a man, Ross!
Ross  (he gets up and starts to run away from her) No! (in his escape attempt he
crushes Chandlers sand castle) No!
Rachel  Oh, come on!
Chandler  Big bullies!!
Ross  Ow! Ow! Oh, no-no-no!
Phoebe  (entering) Oh, hey!
Chandler  Hey!
Ross  Hey!
Phoebe  Oh, so, how are we doing?
Chandler  Bored and bored!
Joey  Hey, you know what naked card game is never boring?
All  Noo!!
Monica  (to Phoebe) So whats Phoebe like?
Phoebe  Im kind, caring, and sweet. Whats Monica like?
Monica  Ah no, the other Phoebe, the one you went to go see.
Phoebe  Ohh, I think she knows where my Dad is.
Joey  What?
Rachel  Really?!
Monica  Oh well, where is he?!
Phoebe  She was acting, she was pretending like she hasnt heard from him
on years, but I found this picture on her fridge, and look (shows Monica)! Isnt this
what he would look like now?
Monica  (gasps) Totally familiar. (Phoebe shows the rest of them.)
Rachel  Oh, yeah.
The Guys  Yeah!
Monica  Well, why would she lie to you?
Phoebe  I dont know, but were having dinner tomorrow night, so I
figured, shes gonna tell me then. Y'know maybe she just wanted to give him time to,
buy me presents, I dont know! So, youre all bored?
All  Ohh!!
Chandler  Yes!
Phoebe  All right, Im gonna close my eyes and point to someone, and you,
whoever I point has to come up with something fun for us to do, and we have to do
it.
Joey  Okay, all right.
Phoebe  Okay.
Joey  Fan out! Fan out!
Phoebe  Okay. (Starts to spin) Ooh, y'know we could just do this. (She stops at
Chandler)
Chandler  Okay, umm, we all have to play strip poker.
Joey  (jumping in triumph) OH YES!!!!!
Monica  Strip Happy Days Game?
Joey  Yeah, well, I couldnt find any cards, so it was either this or Strip
Bag Of Old Knitting Stuff.
Ross  Okay, (reading the card) Fonzy gives you two thumbs up, collect two cool
points. Yeah.
Phoebe  Monica, if you get five cool points, you get to make somebody take off
one item of clothing. It hasnt happened yet, but were all very excited.
Ross  Okay, come on! (blows on the dice) Daddy needs a new pair of
electromagnetic microscopes for the Prehistoric Forensics Department! (They all look at
him, and he shuts up and rolls the dice.) (he moves his piece) Okay. (reading a card) Take
Pinky Tuscadero up to Inspiration Point, collect three cool points!! Yeah! Which gives me
five, and lets see who is gonna lose their clothes. Ummmm, I think I pick our strip
poker sponsor Mr. Joey Tribianni.
The Girls  Woo-hooooo!!!!
Joey  All right, relax. Its just a shoe.
All  Wooooo!!!!
Rachel  (reading a card) Okay, your band is playing at Arnolds, collect
three cool points. Which means, I have five, and that means I get Joeys boxers!
Joey  Fine. Gang up on me! I got you all right where I want you.
Phoebe  Come on, take em off!!
Joey  Actually, y'know its kinda cold, so how about I keep my boxers on,
and give you all a peek at the good stuff?
Rachel  (getting up) All right, Im gonna make more margaritas! (She pours
the rest of the pitcher into Rosss glass.)
Ross  Whoa, hey! What are doing? Trying to get me drunk?
Rachel  Im just making margaritas.
Ross  Okay.
Monica  I think Ill help her out. (She gets up to go over and help Rachel,
and reveals she has no pants.) (to Rachel) What is going on here?
Rachel  What?!
Monica  You painting his toenails?
Rachel  Oh, come on!
Monica  Chasing him all around the room?
Rachel  Monica, please?
Monica  Hes totally flirting with you too.
Rachel  (pause) He is, isnt he? I dont know, I dont know, I
mean maybe its just being here at the beach together or, I dont know. But
its like something... (shes interrupted by the sound of Bonnie entering)
Bonnie  Hey!
Ross  Hey! (Rachel is shocked) Hi Bonnie!
Bonnie  Hi! My boss let me off early, so I took the train.
Ross  Oh.
Bonnie  What are you guys doing?!
Joey  Were playing Strip Happy Days Game!
Bonnie  Cool! Ill catch up! (She takes off her sweater.)
[Scene  The beach house, the next morning. Chandler and Monica are in the kitchen
eating breakfast.]
Chandler  So, you still dont think Im boyfriend material?
Monica  Huh?
Chandler  I saw you checking me out during the game last night.
Monica  You didnt even take off your pants.
Chandler  Yeah, well, lucky for you.
Monica  What?
Chandler  I dont know.
Rachel  (entering) Well! Is everybody else having just the best time?!
Phoebe  Shhh! Shhhh! Joeys asleep.
Phoebe  After he passed out, we put the sand around him to keep him warm.
Rachel  Well I assume the ah, happy couple isnt up yet. Did you guys hear
them last night?
Chandler  Oh, yeah, I dont know what they were doing, but at one point sea
turtles actually came up to the house.
Ross  Good morning.
All  Hey.
Bonnie  Hey! How did everybody sleep?
Rachel  Oh, great.
Monica  Like a log.
Ross and Bonnie  Us too.
Rachel  Im going for a walk.
Ross  (to Joey) Good morning. Nice breasts by the way.
[Scene  The porch, Bonnie is coming back from swimming, Rachel is reading.]
Bonnie  Hey, what happened to you?
Rachel  Oh, ah nothin. I just felt like hangin out here and reading.
Bonnie  Oh, the water was sooo great! We jumped off this pier and my suit came
off.
Rachel  Ohhhh, sorry I missed that.
Bonnie  Yeah, Joey and Chandler sure are funny.
Rachel  Ohh-ha-ha!
Bonnie  I think I brought back half of the beach in my hair. It was so much
easier when I used to shave my head.
Rachel  Y'know, I gotta tell ya, I just loved your look when you were
bald.
Bonnie  Really?!
Rachel  Ohh!
Bonnie  Because I think about shaving it all off again sometime.
Rachel  Really?!
Bonnie  Yeah!
Rachel  I mean you definitely should do that.
Bonnie  Y'know what, I should do it.
Rachel  Yeah!
Bonnie  Yeah, thank you Rachel, you are soo cool.
Rachel  Awww, stop. Come on. Now go shave that head!
Bonnie  All right.
[Scene  The beach house, at night. Phoebe is hangs up the phone, and gently pushes one
of the stools over.]
Joey  Whats the matter, Pheebs?
Phoebe  She cancelled! My namesake cancelled on me!
Joey  What?!
Phoebe  Yeah, she clamed she had to go out of town suddenly. Shes avoiding
me, she doesnt want to tell me where my Father is. She knows, and she wont
tell me.
Rachel  Aww Pheebs, that sucks!
Phoebe  Yeah, well, dont Aww Pheebs, that sucks! me yet. (she
starts to leave)
Chandler  Where ya going?
Phoebe  Well, shes out of town so, theres gotta be something in her
house that tells me where my Father is.
Ross  Uh, Pheebs, some people call that breaking and entering.
Phoebe  Well, are any of those people here?!
All  Oh, no!! No, no!
Phoebe  Okay, look I-I-I do something nice, okay? Ill-Ill fill her
ice trays.
Bonnie  Hey, everybody!
All  Wow!! (they all recoil in shock and horror)
Ross  Wh-haa-haa! Look what cha did! (Rachel has her hand over her mouth
to keep from laughing.)
Bonnie  You wanna touch it?
Ross  Nooo, but it, but its great.
Bonnie  Come on, touch it!
Ross  Okay. (He gently touches it.) You can feel all the bones in your skull.
[Scene  Outside the beach house, Ross is coming out to talk to Rachel.]
Ross  Hi.
Rachel  Hi!
Ross  I was having a little chat with ah, Bonnie, and ah, guess what, she-she
happened to bring up y'know, who was behind the um, whole head shaving idea, and now, who
was it? Oh, thats right, thats right, it was you!
Rachel  That was her idea, I just gave her a nudge.
Ross  She said you gave her the razor!
Bonnie  (joining them) Hey guys.
Rachel  Hey!
Bonnie  So, anyone up for a midnight dip in the ocean?
Ross  Ahh, no, Im good.
Bonnie  Okay, Ill see you in a bit.
Ross  Okay, have fun! Wooo!!
Rachel  Come on see, she doesnt look that bad.
Ross  You can see the moonlight bouncing off her head! What the hell were you
thinking?!!
Rachel  I dont know.
Ross  You dont know?! Rach, you balded my girlfriend!
Rachel  All right! Ross, do you think its easy for me to see you with
somebody else?
Ross  Y'know, hey! Youre the one who ended it, remember?
Rachel  Yeah, because I was mad at you, not because I stopped loving you!
Ross  You still love me?
Rachel  Noo.
Ross  You still love me.
Rachel  Oh, y-yeah, so, you-you love me!
Ross  Noo, nnnnn. What does this mean? What do you, I mean do you wanna, get
back together?
Rachel  Noo! Maybe! I, I dont know. Ross, I still cant forgive you
for what you did, I cant, I just, but sometimes when Im with you I just, I
feel so...
Ross  What?!
Rachel  I just, I feel, I-I just...
Ross  What?
Rachel  I feel...
Chandler  (to Joey) Noo!! I dont care! Im not, Im not gonna
playing one-on-one strip poker with you for practice!
Joey  But I made cards!!
Rachel  Well! Good night. (to Ross) Im going upstairs.
Joey and Chandler  Gnight.
Joey  (to Ross) Wanna play strip poker for practice?
[Scene  Phoebe Sr.s house, Phoebe is breaking in through a window.]
Phoebe  Ow! My ass. Okay. Okay. (She manages to climb completely inside and the
window slams shut.) Oh, shhh!
Phoebe  No! No!! Its me! Its me! I-I didnt want to make any
noise!
Phoebe Sr  Then don't break in!!
Phoebe  Im sorry.
Phoebe Sr  What are you doing here?!
Phoebe  I-I, came to fill your ice cube trays.
Phoebe Sr  What?!
Phoebe  Umm, okay, okay, look. I took this picture from your fridge. Okay,
because I know that this is my Father. Yeah, this is Frank Buffay and you are standing
right there next to him. Now, look I deserve to know where I came from. All right? So if
you can help me find my Father then you should! Otherwise, youre just mean! (pause)
So, just tell me the truth!
Phoebe Sr  All right, the man in the picture is Chuck Magioni.
Phoebe  My Father is Chuck Magioni?
Phoebe Sr  No, no, thats just Chuck Magioni, I-I sold him a house last
year! And Im very sorry, but I dont know where your Father is, and thats
the truth.
Phoebe  Oh.
Phoebe Sr  But umm, youre right. I think that a person should know where
they come from. Wh-which is why I ah, (pause) ahh, (pause) okay. Im your mother.
Phoebe  Heh?
Phoebe Sr  Y'know I wanted to tell you yesterday, but I just, I kinda felt all
floopy, and...
[Scene  Outside the beach house, Ross is telling Joey and Chandler what happened with
Rachel.]
Joey  Im telling ya, you guys are totally getting back together!
Ross  Thats not true! Her, she doesnt even know what she wants!
Rachels still mad about the whole thing.
Chandler  Okay, then you gotta back away, all right? You dont need that
kindve hurt. Take it from a guy whos never had a long term relationship......
Ross  I know, but ahhhhhh!! I really wanna go up there and finish that kiss!
Bonnie  (coming back from her swim) Hey!
Chandler  Ahhhh! (Steps away from her.)
Bonnie  You guys, the waters great. You should really go in.
Chandler  Oh, ahh, no thanks, I just had an M&M.
Bonnie  Okay, well gnight.
Ross  Good night.
Bonnie  (kisses Ross) Dont be too long.
Ross  Okey-dokey!
Chandler  There is not one hair on that head.
Ross  Hey, itll grow back, right? And she-shes really fun, and
shes cool, and-and Im finally moving on. Y'know? I mean getting over Rachel
was so (makes an incoherent nasal sound), y'know? Y'know, and Im finally feeling
sane again. And now if I go up there, and-and I kiss her, and, Gooood I wanna kiss her,
and-and-and it doesnt work out, right? Do I really wanna put myself through that
again?
Joey  So let me get this straight. If you go with Bonnie tonight, youre
doing the smart, healthy thing and moving on.
Ross  Yeah.
Joey  Right, and you go with Rachel, Bonnies free tonight?
[Scene  The hallway between the bedrooms. Ross is coming upstairs and stops between two
doors. He looks at the one on the right, then he looks at the one on his left, thinks
about it, and goes in the one on his right.]
Ross  (entering the bedroom) Hi. (closes the door)
[Scene  The beach house, Chandler is simulating hes coming to pick up Monica for
a date. Chandler knocks on the door, and Monica answers it.]
Chandler  (in a fake voice) Hi there.
Monica  Thats that weird voice again.
Chandler  Okay! Okay! Let me try it again, youre gonna wanna date this
next guy, I swear!
Chandler  Hi! Im Dorf! Youre date for the evening. (Monica walks
away in disgust) Oh come on! Dorf on dating, thats good stuff!!
