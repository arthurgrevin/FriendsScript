[Scene  Monica, Chandler, and Phoebe's, Chandler, Joey, Rachel, and Phoebe are standing
around the table drinking champagne as Ross enters.]
Ross  Hey, whats going on?
Chandler  Hey.
Ross  I found a note on my door, "Come to Monicas quick, bring
champagne and a Three Musketeers bar."
Joey  (grabbing the candy bar) Yeah Ill take that.
Ross  Whats up?
Chandler  Monica and I are engaged.
Ross  Oh my God. (Hugs Chandler.) Congratulations.
Chandler  Thanks.
Ross  Where is she?
Monica  (yelling at the top of her lungs) Im engaged!!!!!! Im
engaged!!!!
Joey  Yeah, shes been out there for twenty minutes, Im surprised you
didnt hear her on the way over.
Ross  Oh, I thought it was just a kid yelling, "Im gay! Im
gay!" Can I bring her in?
Phoebe  Oh no, let her stay out there. Its sweet.
Monica  Im getting married!!!! Im gonna be a bride!!!! (Someone else
yells at her.) No, I will not shut up because Im engaged! (He yells again.) Ohh, big
talk! Huh, why dont you come over here and say that to me?! Huh, buddy?! Yeah, my
fiancee will kick your ass! (Chandler starts to look worried.) Come on, apartment 20!
Apartment 20!
Chandler  (To Ross) Okay, you get her in here. (To Joey) You bolt the door.
Ill be in the closet.
[Scene  Monica, Chandler, and Phoebe's, continued from earlier, everyone is now in the
living room drinking champagne.]
Monica  Okay! Wait-wait-wait! Shhh! (Bangs on her class with a spoon to make a
toast.) Okay, umm, I just wanna say thatI love you guys so-so much and-and thank you
for being here on my special night. (Chandler clears his throat.) Our special night. I
mean it just wouldnt be myour-our night, if you all werent here to
celebrate with meusDamnit!
Chandler  Its okay, I want this to be your night too. (Raises his class.)
To Monica.
Monica  Awww, come onwaitstop it. Okay, to Monica.
Chandler  To Monica!
Phoebe  So have you decided on a band for the wedding? Because, yknow,
Im kinda musical.
Rachel  Yeah Pheebs, honey, she just got engaged a couple of hours ago. I doubt
shes even had time to
Phoebe  Well speaking of chiming in, remember the time you burned down my
apartment?
Rachel  (To Monica) Yeah, youre on your own.
Monica  Yknow what we should do? We should all get dressed up and go to
have champagne at The Plaza.
Joey  But I-I-I cant stay too long, I gotta get up early for a commercial
audition tomorrow and I gotta look good. Im supposed to be playing a 19-year-old.
(Everyone stops in their tracks upon hearing this.) What?
Chandler  So when you said, "Get up early," did you mean 1986?
Joey  You guys dont think I look 19?
Phoebe  Oh, 19! We thought you said 90!
Monica  Okay everybody, lets go! Lets go!
Rachel  Okay.
Chandler  Okay.
Joey  (To Phoebe) Hey, is uh the rest of my candy bar around here?
Phoebe  Oh honey no, you ate it all.
Joey  I was afraid of that.
[Scene  Monica and Chandlers bedroom, theyre getting ready.]
Monica  (looking at her hand) Yknow what shoes would look great with this
ring? Diamond shoes! (Sees Chandler sitting on the bed.) Youre not getting dressed.
(Chandler quietly folds over the comforter on the bed making a spot for her.)
Chandler  Know what I mean?
Monica  Yeah, but I dont think we have time.
Chandler  Theres gonna be a wedding. Youre gonna be the bride. Two
hundred people are going to be looking at you in a clean white dress.
Monica  (lustily) Lets do it! (She kisses him and they fall back onto the
bed.)
[Scene  Monica, Chandler, and Phoebe's, time lapse, Chandler is fully dressed and
slowly walking out of the bedroom with a distressed look on his face.]
Monica  (chasing after him) Chandler! It happens to lots of guys! You-you-you
were probably tired, you had a lot of champagne, dont worry about it!
Chandler  (motioning with his hands) Im not worried, Im uh, Im
fascinated. Yknow its like uh, Biology! Which is funny because in high school
I uh, I-I failed Biology and tonight Biology failed me. (Exits as Phoebe enters from her
room with her guitar.)
Phoebe  Check it out. Okay, I can play this when the guests are coming in. Okay.
(Singing)
Monica  Phoebe!
Phoebe  If you wouldve let me finish, it goes on to say that hes
probably not gay.
[Scene  Joey and Rachel's, Chandler is looking at the foosball table.]
Chandler  Sure, you guys dont have this problem, youre made of wood.
(Rachel comes out of the bathroom) Hey!
Rachel  Hey!
Chandler  You look great!
Rachel  (quietly) Oh, thanks.
Chandler  You okay over there?
Rachel  I dont know, yknow? I feel a little umm No,
yknow what? Nevermind, Im gonna be fine.
Chandler  Oh, dont worry about it I mean you probably were tired, you had
a lot of champagne, it happens to everybody.
Ross  Hey!
Rachel  Hi!
Ross  Wow! Happy Monicas night!
Rachel  Well thank you, you too.
Ross  Thanks.
Rachel  Hey, do you believe this? Do you believe they are actually getting
married?
Ross  Well sure. But I get married all the time so
Rachel  Ohh
Ross  You okay?
Rachel  Yeah, I guess. I-I I mean, do-do you think were ever gonna
have that?
Ross  You mean, weyou and me?
Rachel  Oh no-no-no-no-no, no, no! We, you with someone and me with someone.
Ross  Oh good, you scared me for a minute.
Rachel  Shake it off.
Ross  I meanno, its just cause, its just cause you
and I were like a nightmare. (Screams.) No, but there was some good times.
Rachel  No, absolutely. Yknow like it was umm
Ross  Surely you can think of something good.
Rachel  Yeah, just give me a minute! (Thinking) Oh well, yes, I can think of one
good thing.
Ross  What?
Rachel  Well you uh, you were always really good at the uh, at the uh the stuff.
Ross  Yeah? I was good at the stuff huh?
Rachel  Uh-hmm, uh-hmm, yeah, yeah, I really liked your hands.
Ross  My hands?
Rachel  Yeah.
Ross  Yeah?
Rachel  Uh-huh.
Ross  (to his hands) Way to go guys. Yknow, you-you were really good at
the stuff too.
Rachel  Oh, I know. Hey, yknow what we never did? (Ross looks at her.) Oh
no, not that. (Ross nods okay.) We uh, we never had bonus night!
Ross  A what?
Rachel  Yknow, bonus night. Yknow, when two people break up but they
get back together for just one night.
Ross  One night, just-just sex. No strings attached?
Rachel  Yeah-yeah, we never had that,
Ross  No.
Ross  Okay, this is getting a little crazy. I mean, Im-Im sure it
would be amazing but Igotta say I really-really dont think it would be a good
idea. Yknow? I really, reallydont.
[Scene  Joey and Rachel's, Chandler is playing Playstation, Crash Team Racing
to be exact (hes in last on Hot Air Skyway to be more exact) as Joey enters from his
room desperately trying to look like a 19-year-old. Hes got the wool cap, hes
got the cut-off Knicks jersey over the faded T-shirt, and hes got the whole
pants-around-the-knees-showing-off-the-boxers thing that rich, white, suburban kids have
adopted in a desperate and extremely futile attempt to try to look like theyre from
the inner-city.]
Joey  Sup? Sup dude?
Chandler  (putting his hands up) Take whatever you want, just please dont
hurt me.
Joey  So youre playing a little Playstation, huh? Thats
whack! Playstation is whack! Sup with the whack Playstation,
sup?! Huh? Come on, am I 19 or what?!
Chandler  Yes, on a scale from 1 to 10, 10 being the dumbest a person can look,
you are definitely 19.
Joey  Come on man, really how old?!
Chandler  Young! Youre a man-child okay?! Now go get changed because
everybodys ready and please, oh please, keep my underwear!
Joey  Wow thanks! (He goes into his bedroom and closes the door.)
Chandler  Joe?
Joey  Yeah!
Chandler  Uhh, youve had a lot of sex right?
Joey  When? Today? Some, not a lot.
Chandler  Well, its just the reason that Im asking is because I kind
of eh, uh, I was unable toI mean I really wanted too, but I couldnt.
There huhhmm, there-there was an incident.
Joey  Dont worry about that man, that happens.
Chandler  Its happened to you?
Joey  Yeah! Once.
Chandler  Well, whatd you do?
Joey  I did it anyway.
[Scene  Monica, Chandler, and Phoebe's, Monica is in the living room and Phoebe is in
her room.]
Monica  Phoebe! Come on! Lets go! (Knocks on her door.) Come on! (Phoebe
enters with guitar and not ready to go.) Why arent you dressed yet?!
Phoebe  Im sorry, but I just wrote the best dance song for your wedding.
Check this out. (Gets ready to play.)
Monica  (grabs the guitar away from her) No, Phoebe, Ill tell you what, if
you get ready now Ill let you play it at the wedding.
Phoebe  Really?! Oh thats so exciting! Thank you! Thanks Mon! Oh but Mon,
if you touch my guitar again Ill have to pound on you for a little bit.
Monica  Fair enough, now go get ready!
Phoebe  Okay. (She goes to get ready.)
Monica  Ill get everybody else (Does so), finally we can start celebrating
my(She gasps and is stopped by the sight of Ross and Rachel making out in the hall.)
Im sorry, uh apparently Ive opened the door to the past.
[Scene  Monica, Chandler, and Phoebe's, continued from before the commercial break.
Monica is walking into the apartment followed by Ross and Rachel.]
Ross  Okay, Monica. Mon, uh what-what you just saw
Monica  (interrupting) Can I ask you just a little question, huh? Why tonight?
Rachel  What?
Monica  See, Ive been waiting my whole life to be engaged, and unlike some
people Im only planning on doing this once. So, uh yknow, maybe this is
selfish and Im sorry about it, but I was kinda hoping tonight could just be about
that.
Rachel  Oh honey, but it is just about
Ross  It is! It is!
Monica  No its not! No! No! Now its about you and Ross getting back
together!
Rachel  What?!
Monica  See yeah umm, you kinda stole my thunder!
Ross  Okay! Ho-ho! We did not steal your thunder because we are not
getting back together!
Rachel  Yeah. No. And you know what? Nobody even saw!
Ross  Yeah!
Monica  Thats true.
Rachel  Honey I swear it we just kissed.
Ross  It was just a kiss. (Phoebe enters and overhears this.)
Phoebe  You guys kissed!!!!! What does this mean?!! Are you, are you getting
back together?! Can I sing at your wedding?
Monica  Thunder being stolen!!
Rachel  Okay come on Phoebe, its nothing! Monica, come on!
Ross  Look lets not make a big deal out of this! It was a one time
thing. It doesnt even matter!
Joey  Oh my God! I cannot believe you guys are talking about this! The problems
in the bedroom are between the man and the woman!!! All right?!! Now Chandler is doing the
best he can!!
Chandler  (angrily) I dont think thats what they were talking about
Joe!!
Phoebe  What a great night, Chandler cant do it, these guys kissed
(Points to Ross and Rachel.)
Joey  What?
Chandler  What?!
Joey  You guys kissed! Oh mythis is huge!
Rachel  No!
Ross  Oh no!
Rachel  No-no, its really not huge.
Ross  And; people thinking its huge has led Monica to believe that we
are stealing her thunder. (To Monica) Which we are not!
Monica  Well, were still talking about it, arent we?
Phoebe  Well yeah, that and Chandlers problem.
Joey  Monica-Monica-Monica-Monica, listen-listen, listen, listen, would-would it
make you feel better if we all stop talking about Ross and Rachel.
Monica  Yes that would be lovely.
Joey  You got it. Okay. Now, I can pass for 19 right?!
Chandler  Yes, you can pass for 19.
Joey  Really?
Chandler  Yes!
Joey  Seriously?
Chandler  Seriously? Seriously, no! You can play your own age which is 31!
Joey  (gasps) Im 30!
Rachel  Joey, you are not! Youre 31.
Joey  (realizes) Aww crap!
Phoebe  Okay, so The Plaza! Okay, well get us some Mai Thais,
(To Chandler) maybe no more for you though.
Monica  Yknow what? I-I think that umm, I dont feel like going to The
Plaza.
Phoebe  Why?!
Rachel  Honey, Monica, this is ridiculous! Look
Monica  No-no, I-I really dont want to talk about it! I dont! (To
Rachel) Especially with you. (Goes into her room.)
Joey  Psss, that is whack!
Phoebe  (shes strumming something) Yeah? (Joey nods yes.) Okay, I think
Ill play it at the wedding.
Joey  Yeah! Well, I think well see if they actually let you play. Huh? I
mean they tell you anything you want to hear like-like, "You look 19," and then
they just take it away like-like, "No you dont."
Phoebe  Well, I dont think Monica is gonna take this away.
Joey  Wouldnt she?
Phoebe  Would she?
Joey  Would she? (He smells something and gasps as he realizes what it is.) You
ate my candy bar!
[Scene  Rachels bedroom, shes pacing as Ross knocks on her door and opens
it a little to stick his hands in.]
Ross  Guess who? (Enters fully.)
Rachel  Hey.
Ross  Hey, I just realized we kinda let some stuff up in the air
Rachel  What do you think Monica mean when she said she didnt want to
talk, especially with me? I mean, why not especially you and me? We were both out there
kissing.
Ross  Still thinking about it huh?
Rachel  Come on! Serious-ser-ser-seriously, what did she mean by that?
(Mimicking Monica.) Especially you!
Ross  (loosening his tie) Oh, who cares?
Rachel  I care!
Ross  (tightening his tie) And so do I.
Rachel  Yknow what, I-I have to go talk to her, would you let me just get
changed?
Ross  Okay. Sure. (Sits down on her bed.)
Rachel  Am I going to let you watch me undress?
Ross  (sitting up) No! (Exits.)
[Scene  Monica and Chandlers bedroom, they are both getting undressed.]
Monica  I cant believe her, yknow its justits so
typical.
Chandler  Now Monica, I know youre upset, but dont forget. There is
going to be a wedding, you are going to throw the bouquet, and then theres
going to be a honeymoon, maybe in Paris.
Monica  Paris?
Chandler  We will take a moonlit walk on the Rue de la (mumbles something).
Monica  Keep talking.
Chandler  Then we will sprinkle rose pedals on the bed and make love. Not just
because its romantic, but because I can!
Monica  I love you!
Monica  (in a French accent) Bonjour, monsieur.
Chandler  Okay, dont say anything, you might scare it away.
Chandler  Its Paris, who knows were here!
Monica  (opening the door) Hi Pheebs, whats up? (She enters.)
Phoebe  Okay, you said I could sing at your wedding so, Im just gonna need
a small deposit.
Monica  What?!
Phoebe  Yknow, just some good faith money to hold the date.
Chandler  Pheebs, were not giving you a deposit for our wedding!
Phoebe  Oh, I see. (Exits angrily.)
Joey  They break your heart, dont they?
Phoebe  Yknow, I dont really their permission.
Joey  Yeah! If you wanna sing at their wedding, well you sing at their wedding!
Phoebe  Yeah! And if you wanna look 19, then you You gotta do something
about your eyes.
Joey  What?! Whats wrong with my eyes.
Phoebe  They give you away! Theres just-theres just too much wisdom
in there. (Joey nods in agreement.) Just put some tea bags on there for like 15 minutes.
Joey  And thatll get rid of my wisdom?
Phoebe  Maybe just 10 minutes for you.
Chandler  Oh, give her the deposit! Give her the ring! I dont care!
Monica  Yes.
Rachel  Monica, what did you mean before when you said you didnt want to
talk to anyone, especially me?
Chandler  What a great apology! (To Monica) And you accept! Okay, bye-bye!
Rachel  No-no, seriously-seriously, what was the especially me part about?
Monica  Well, lets just say its not the first time youve
stolen my thunder.
Rachel  What?!
Ross  (To Rachel) Hey, heres a thought.
Rachel  Monica, what are you talking about?
Monica  My Sweet Sixteen! Remember, you went to third base with my cousin
Charlie.
Chandler  (entering) Ahh, third base.
Monica  Its all everybody at the party could talk about!
Rachel  Monica, yknow what? The only reason I did that was because your
party was so boring!
Monica  (gasps) We had a characturist!
Rachel  Oh!!
Phoebe  (singing, angrily)
Rachel  Monica, your Sweet Sixteen was like a million years ago.
Monica  And yet, here we are doing it again.
Rachel  Ugh, Monica I dont want to steal your stupid thunder!
Monica  Oh please! Why else would you have made out with Ross?!
Ross  Got me. (He shows of his hands.)
Rachel  All right, easy mimey, the moment has passed, it aint gonna
happen!
Monica  I just thought it would be nice if I could have just this one night!
Rachel  I swear, I never wanted any part of your night!
Monica  Oh, is that why you did it the secret hallway where nobody ever goes?!
Ross  Uh, Rachel, Ive been thinking. I dont think us getting
together tonight is such a good idea. Im calling it off.
Chandler  (To Ross) Why to save your dignity my man.
Rachel  (ignoring them) Monica, why? Why would I ever want to take away from
your night?
Monica  I dont know! I dontmaybe youre feeling a little
resentful. Maybe ah, maybe you thought youd get married first! Maybe you cant
stand the fact that your formally fat friend is getting married before you!
Rachel  Oh wow. Thatyknow what? That is so unfair. Yknow what?
Now I want to steal your thunder! Come on Ross, lets go have sex!
Monica  (yelling after them) I cant believe youre gonna have sex on
my engagement night!!
Chandler  Well, somebody should. (Monica glares at him.)
Ross  Look uh, if were gonna do this
Rachel  Were not gonna do this, all right? Shes just gonna think
that were doin it.
Ross  Oh, I see, so everybody wins.
Rachel  Who is it?
Monica  (outside the door) Its Monica, open up!
Rachel  Okay well Ross! Stop it please! Wait a minute! (Motions for him to
follow her lead, but he angrily shakes his head no. So she pokes him.)
Ross  Oww!
Rachel  Yeah, you like that baby? (Monica bursts in followed by Chandler.) May
we help you?
Monica  I just wanted to say that I hope you do have sex tonight and I hope that
you guys get back together, but I must warn you, the night that you announce your
engagement Im going to announce that Im pregnant!
Chandler  How is that ever going to happen?!
Rachel  All right Monica, do you want to know why I was with Ross tonight?!
Monica  I know why!
Rachel  No you dont know why!
Monica  Okay! Why?!
Rachel  Because! Because I was sad.
Monica  What do you mean?
Rachel  Look, I am soso happy for you guys, but you getting married just
reminds me of the fact that Im not. Im not even close. And I dont know,
maybe I just wanted to make myself feel better. And I know that thats dumb, but oh
my God you were so depressed when Ross got married that you slept with Chandler!
Chandler  (To Ross) I dont care, she slept with me.
Rachel  Anyway sweetie, I am, Im so sorry I ruined your night.
Monica  (starting to cry) Im sorry I almost made you sleep with Ross.
(They hug.)
Ross  (deadpan) Well, Im going to take off. (To Chandler) Congratulations
man.
Chandler  Thanks.
Ross  (at the door) And uh, Rachel.
Rachel  Yeah.
Ross  What can I say, you missed your chance. From now on the only person
whos going to enjoy these bad boys (holds up his hands) is me. (Quickly realizes
what he said and exits disgustedly.)
[Scene  Monica, Chandler, and Phoebe's, Phoebe is singing outside Monica and
Chandlers door.]
Phoebe  (singing)
Chandler  (interrupting her just in time) Hey! Heres a dollar, consider it
a deposit. Please sing at our wedding.
Phoebe  Oh thank you.
Chandler  Okay. (Goes back to bed.)
Phoebe  Now (Starts singing again) "Who will perform the ceremony!
Who will perform the cer(Chandler enters and grabs her guitar and closes the
door behind him)Ohoh! All right, Ill pound on him in the morning.
[Scene  Monica, Chandler, and Phoebe's, everyone is there having breakfast and Joey
enters carrying a loaf of bread.]
Joey  Hey!
Ross  Hi!
Joey  Who wants French toast?
Ross  Oh, Ill have some!
Joey  Good, me too. (Tosses him the loaf.) Eggs and milk are in the fridge.
Thanks.
Monica  (entering from her room) Oww!
Chandler  Whats the matter honey?
Monica  I dont know, my hand feels weird. I guess its because,
Im engaged! (Shows off the ring.) How long before it starts getting annoying?
Phoebe  It starts?
Rachel  Yeah, so lets get started on the wedding plans!
Monica  Okay! (Runs off.)
Chandler  (incredulous) Already?!
Rachel  Yeah, we got a lot to do! We gotta think about the flowers, the
caterers, the music
Chandler  Oh, I got some thoughts on that.
Rachel  Oh wait Chandler, too many cooks
Ross  Take from me, as the groom all you have to do is show up and try to say
the right name.
Monica  (returning) Okay! (Sets down a huge 3" 3-ring binder on the table.)
Chandler  What in Gods name is that?!
Ross  Oh my God, the wedding book?! I havent seen that since the forth
grade!
Monica  This baby has got everything. Take yknow, locations for instance.
(She opens up the binder to the locations chapter.) First, organized alphabetically, then
geographically, then by square footage.
Phoebe  That is so smart! (To Chandler, under her breath) Break it off. Break it
off now.
[Scene  A Classroom, Ross is giving a lecture.]
Ross  And that should conclusively prove that I had the idea for Jurassic
Park first! Now lets take a look at (Phoebe rushes in.)
Phoebe  Hey! Ross!
Ross  Phoebe, oh my God! Wh-wh-what are you doing here?
Phoebe  I need to talk to you, its pretty urgent. Its about Monica
and Chandler.
Ross  Oh my God! Of course, of course. (To the class.) Umm, would you please
excuse me for a moment? Umm, do you know each others hometowns? Why dont
you (Motions that they should learn everyones hometown.) (To Phoebe)
Wh-whats going on?
Phoebe  Well, umm, not much. But, I was just thinking that since those guys just
got engaged that maybe it would be nice if they had some privacy, yknow? So, could I
just move in with you for a couple days?
Ross  Umm, okay, yeah, sure. But wh-whats wrong with Monica and Chandler?
Phoebe  NothingWhy?!
Ross  Phoebe, you said it was urgent!
Phoebe  Oh yeah it is! Im going to the movies and it starts in like five
minutes.
Ross  Do you realize I have a classroom full of students?
Phoebe  (to the students) Oh, Im sorry. Im so rude. Does anyone want
to come to the movies?
[Scene  Monica, Chandler, and Phoebe's, Rachel and Monica are pretty much telling
Chandler what the wedding plans are.]
Monica  All right, so I havent cleared the budget with my parents yet, but
tell me how this is for music.
Rachel  Okay.
Monica  All right umm, a string quartet for the procession.
Rachel  Aw.
Monica  A jazz trio for cocktails. The Bay City Rollers for dancing.
Wait, that was from my sixth grade wedding.
Chandler  Well, you couldnt get them anyway. Ian doesnt plan anymore
and Derrick (Off of Rachel and Monicas looks) And Derrick is a name I
shouldnt know.
Joey  (sitting up from the couch) Hey Mon, do you have another pillow? (Holds up
one.) Yknow, something a little snugglyer?
Chandler  Why are you napping over here instead of over at your place?
Joey  Well, the duck
Rachel  What?! The duck?! What the hell did the damn duck do now?!
Joey  Uh, well he did not get sick somewhere in there and it was
immediately found and properly cleaned up!
Chandler  Now, do I get to look at this book or is it just for people who are
actually involved in the wedding?
Monica  Of course you can look at it! Yeah, I want your opinion too!
Chandler  Okay.
Monica  Here you go! What do you think about centerpieces?
Chandler  Centerpieces!
Monica  Yeah! Roses or Lilies? (Holds up a picture of each.)
Chandler  Definitely roses. (Monica and Rachel exchange a look.) Well, I just
think theyre a little more weddingy. (Monica holds the Lily picture closer to him.)
But Lilies are the clear choice.
Monica  Oh my God! Its like one mind.
Chandler  Uh-huh!
Joey  (sitting up again) Guys! Guys!! You gotta let me nap! Ugh, Im
gonna get cranky!
Rachel  Joey, there is a perfectly good couch across the hall!
Joey  Yes it is perfectly good, and it is not one of the places the duck
got sick!
Rachel  What?!
Joey  All right, Im gonna go! (Gets up and heads for the door.)
Rachel  Now Joey, what did the duck do?!
Joey  I dont know! But he did not eat your face cream!
Joey  Hey little buddy, how are you feeling? (The duck does not get sick
and Joey recoils in horror and heads for the couch.) What the hell is in that face cream?
(Hes about to try out the couch but notices the bed in Rachels room. He walks
into her room and feels the bed.) Thats so soft. (He pulls back the comforter.)
Pillowcases! (He climbs in and groans in delight. Suddenly, he feels something under him
and pulls out a little beat up paperback book. He opens it and starts to read from it.)
(In his head.) Zelda looked at the chimney sweep. Her father, the vicar(Stops
reading and thinks.) The vicar? (Continues reading) wouldnt be home
for hours. Her loins were burning. She threw caution to the wind and reached out and
grabbed his(Out loud.) Whoa! (Reads on in silence.) Whoa-ho-ho-ho! This is a
dirty book! (Continues to read.)
[Scene  Rosss apartment, Phoebe has moved in and has a massage client on her
table shes set up in the living room. Ross enters and is shocked to see a naked man
lying on the table.]
Ross  Uh, Phoebe
Phoebe  Oh Ross, hi.
Ross  Phoebe, what are you doing?
Phoebe  Im sorry, Im with a client right now.
Ross  Phoebe!
Phoebe  Okay, lets talk outside.
Ross  Phoebe, you cant massage people in my apartment!
Phoebe  Whats the big deal? I did it at Monica and Chandlers!
Ross  And they knew about it?
Phoebe  (pause as she considers it) Okay, well Ross, what is this really about?
Ross  Look, this is my home and I want to be able to come and go whenever I
want!
Phoebe  Okay, I will find someplace else to do the rest of my appointments. I
just dont know what the big deal is!
Ross  The big deal is I dont want naked, greasy strangers in my apartment
when I want to kick back with a puzzlebeer! Cold beer.
[Scene  Joey and Rachel's, Joey is sweeping up as Rachel enters.]
Rachel  Hey Joey, what cha doing?
Joey  Sweepin. Why? Turn you on?
Rachel  No.
Joey  Huh. What if I was sweeping a chimney?
Rachel  Joey, did you my face cream?
Joey  Where are you going? The vicar wont be home for hours.
Rachel  Joey, (nervously) where did you learn that word?
Joey  Where do you think, (pause) Zelda?
Rachel  (gasps) You found my book?!
Joey  Yeah I did!
Rachel  Joey, what-what are you doing going into my bedroom?!
Joey  Okay, look Im sorry, I went in there to take a nap and I know I
shouldnt have, but you got porn!
Rachel  Hey-hey, yknow what? I dont care! Im not ashamed of my
book. Theres nothing with a woman enjoying a littleerotica. Its just a
healthy expression of female sexuality, which by the way, you will never understand. (She
goes into her room.)
Joey  You got porn!
[Scene  Ross's apartment, Ross is coming out of the living room carrying his salad and
a puzzlebeer! Cold beer. And he decides to fold up Phoebes massage table, but
being Ross has trouble with it as there is a knock on the door. He sets the table back up
and opens the door to reveal a beautiful woman.]
Ross  Hello.
Woman  Hi, is uh Phoebe here?
Ross  Uh no-no, she-shes out for the night.
Woman  Ohh great.
Ross  Can I, can I help you with something?
Woman  Well, I dont know. Are you a masseur?
Ross  (deadpan) Yes I am.
Woman  Great! (Calls down the hall) Dad! (Her old father walks in.) Thank you so
much, Ill be back to pick him up in an hour. (She walks away.)
[Scene  A Restaurant, Monica and Chandler are having dinner with her parents.]
Mrs. Geller  So Chandler, youre parents mustve been thrilled when
you told them you were engaged.
Chandler  Oh yeah, I should probably call them.
Mr. Geller  I remember when we first got engaged.
Chandler  Oh, I dont think I ever heard that story.
Monica  Oh dad, really you dont need to
Mr. Geller  (ignoring her) Well, Id gotten Judy pregnant. I still
dont know that happened.
Mrs. Geller  (incredulous) You dont know how that happened?! Your dog
thought my diaphragm was a chew toy!
Chandler  What a sweet story.
Monica  Well, at least youre not hearing it for the first time at your
fifth grade Halloween party.
Mr. Geller  What?! They wanted a scary story!
Monica  Anyway, were really excited about our wedding plans, and well I
guess pretty soon well be making a big withdrawal from the Monica wedding fund.
(Chandler and her laugh, but her parents dont.) What?
Mrs. Geller  You tell her Jack, I cant do it.
Monica  What happened? You still have the Monica wedding fund dont you?
Mr. Geller  We have it. Only now, we call it the beach house.
[Scene  A Restaurant, scene continued from before the break.]
Monica  I dont believe you spent my wedding fund on the beach house!
Mrs. Geller  Were sorry honey, but we just assumed if you got married
after you turned 30 youd pay for it yourself.
Monica  You bought the beach house when I was 23!
Mr. Geller  Which means you had seven years of beach fun and you cant put
a price on that sweetie.
Mrs. Geller  We really do feel bad about this though.
Mr. Geller  We started saving again when you were dating Richard and then that
went to hell, so we redid the kitchen.
Monica  What about when I started dating Chandler?
Mrs. Geller  Well it was Chandler! We didnt think hed ever
propose!
Chandler  Clearly I did not start drinking enough at the start of the meal.
(Starts to make up for lost time and takes a big swig of his drink.)
Monica  I cant believe it! That there is no money for my wedding?!
Mrs. Geller  We might still have some money, if your father didnt
think it was a good idea to sell ice over the Internet.
Mr. Geller  It seemed like such a simple idea.
Mrs. Geller  Stupid Jack, the word is stupid.
Mr. Geller  All right, enough! I dont want to hear about it anymore!
(Under his breath) Good luck, Chandler. (Chandler takes another drink.)
[Scene  Ross's apartment, his massage client is on the table and Ross is reluctantly
starting his massage. He spreads some lotion in his hands, and doesnt like it.]
Ross  Okay! Now, Im going to touch you. (He does so, very gingerly.) Ohh,
thats soft. (He starts poking him and notices his salad spoons and starts to massage
him with those.)
[Scene  Monica, Chandler, and Phoebe's, Monica and Chandler are returning from dinner,
Rachel is already there.]
Monica  I cant believe this. Do you think that your parents could help pay
for it?
Chandler  I dont know, my mother spent most of her money on her fourth
wedding. Shes saving the rest for her divorce. And any extra cash my father has he
saves for his yearly trips to (Pause) Dollywood.
Rachel  Well what happened at dinner?
Monica  My parents spent the money for our wedding!
Phoebe  (gasps) My God! What did you order?!
Rachel  Wait, but theres no money! Well this is terrible! You guys are
gonna have to get married in like a, rec. center!
Chandler  Honey, its gonna be okay.
Monica  No! No its not! Its not gonna be okay! It sucks! No swing
band! No lilies!
Rachel  No, yknow what? Its gonna be okay. I mean you dont
have to have this rustic Italian feast. Yknow? And-and you dont need, you
dont need this custom-made, empire waisted, duchess, satin gown; you can wear off
the rack. (She starts to cry, as does Monica.)
Chandler  Look, it really is gonna be okay. The important thing is that we love
each other and that were gonna get married.
Rachel  Do you even understand what off the rack means?!
Phoebe  Look, why dont you just pay for it yourself?
Monica  How? I dont have any money.
Chandler  Well, I have some.
Monica  How much?
Chandler  Well, close to (Notices Rachel leaning in to hear and decides to
write it on a piece of paper and hand it to Monica as Phoebe averts her eyes.)
Monica  Whoa!!! Are you kidding me?!
Rachel  Well what?! How-how much is it?!
Monica  Its enough for wedding scenario eight.
Rachel  Ohh! (Whispers.) Really?!
Monica  (To Chandler) How great are you, you little saver?! I mean, the-the
amount you have is exactly the budget of my dream wedding!
Rachel  (starting to cry) Ohh, you guys are so made for each other.
Chandler  Well, youre not suggesting that we spend all of the money on the
wedding?
Rachel and Monica 
Chandler  Well, come on, Ive been saving this money for six years and I
kinda had some of it earmarked for the future, not just for a party.
Phoebe  (reading the slip of paper) Wow! (In a sultry voice) Hello, Mr.
Chandler.
Monica  This is the most special day of our lives.
Chandler  No, I realize that honey, but Im not gonna spend all of the
money on one party.
Monica  Honey, umm I-I love you, (laughs) but umm, if you call our wedding a
party one more time, you may not get invited. Okay? (Laughs) Listen, we could always
earn more money, okay? But uh, were only gonna get married once.
Chandler  Look, I understand, but I have to put my foot down. Okay? The answer
is no.
Monica  You-youre gonna have to put your foot down?
Chandler  Yes, I am!
Phoebe  Wow, money and a firm hand. Finally a Chandler I can get on board with.
[Scene  Central Perk, Joey and Ross are there as Rachel enters and sees Joey sitting
there.]
Joey  Hey Rach.
Rachel  (quietly) Joey.
Joey  Hey Rach, do you smell smoke?
Rachel  Uh-huh, I get it, smoke, chimney, chimney sweep, very funny, ha-ha.
Joey  No-no-no, Im serious. You dont smell it? Somethings on
fire.
Rachel  Well no, I dont smell anything.
Joey  Oh, yknow what? Its probably just your burnin loins.
Ross  (sitting down) Hey, what are you guys, what are you guys talking about?
Rachel  Nothing!
Ross  (takes a drink) Damn, this coffees cold! Hey Rach, do you mind if I
heat this up on your loins? (Joey and he both laugh.)
Rachel  Yknow, I can not believe you told him, Joey!
Ross  So I guess you bought that book after we broke up huh?
Rachel  Uh-huh, yeah I did, because I wore out my first copy when I was with
you. (Exits.)
Ross  (chases her) Oh yeah, yeah? Well uh, when we were going out, I read tons
of porno magazines! (Realizes a table of women overheard him.) (To that table.) Sup?
Phoebe  (entering) Ross! How could you do that to an old man?!
Ross  (looking at the table) Excuse me ladies. (To Phoebe) Im sorry?
Phoebe  My massage client, Arthur? His daughter called and said that some guy
that worked for me gave him a really weird massage this afternoon.
Ross  (incredulous) I gave him an extremely professional massage!
Phoebe  He said you poked at him with wooden spoons.
Ross  Okay, so it wasnt uh, a traditional massage. But I did give him
accu-pressure with a pair of chopsticks. And, and I gently exfoliated him with, with a
mop.
Phoebe  Well, hes never coming back! Okay? You just cost me eight dollars
a week!
Ross  Hey, yknow what? This is your fault! Youre the one that
didnt move his-his appointment.
Phoebe  Oh, its my fault?! You didnt have to massage him! You
couldve sent him away! You couldve not rolled Tonka trucks up and down
his back!
Ross  He said he liked that!! Oh youre right, youre right. Im
sorry.
Joey  Dude, what are you massaging an old man for?
Ross  His daughter was hot.
Joey  Gotcha.
[Scene  Monica, Chandler, and Phoebe's, Chandler is looking at the wedding book as
Monica enters.]
Monica  Hey.
Chandler  Hey.
Monica  Listen umm, Ive been thinking, its not fair for me to ask
you to spend all of your money on our wedding. I mean, you work, you work really hard for
that.
Chandler  Ehh.
Monica  Eh, you work for that.
Chandler  Look, I thought about it too, and Im sorry. I think we should
spend all of the money on the wedding.
Monica  You do?!
Chandler  Yeah, Im putting my foot down. Yeah look, when I proposed I told
you that I would do anything to make you happy, and if having the perfect wedding makes
you happy then, then thats what were gonna do.
Monica  Oh, youre so sweet. (They hug and kiss.) Oh, but wait, what about
our, what about the future and stuff?
Chandler  Eh, forget about the future and stuff! So we only have two kids,
yknow? Well pick our favorite and that one will get to go to college.
Monica  You thought about that?
Chandler  Yeah.
Monica  How many kids were we gonna have?
Chandler  Uh, four, a boy, twin girls and another boy.
Monica  What else did you think about?
Chandler  Well, stuff like whered we live, yknow? Like a small place
outside the city, where our kids could learn to ride their bikes and stuff. Yknow,
we could have a cat that had a bell on its collar and we could hear it every time it
ran through the little kitty door. Of course, wed have an apartment over the garage
where Joey could grow old.
Monica  (laughs) Yknow what? I-I dont want a big, fancy wedding.
Chandler  Sure you do.
Monica  No, I want everything you just said. I want a marriage.
Chandler  You sure?
Monica  Uh-hmm.
Chandler  I love you so much.
Monica  I love you. (They kiss.) Hey listen umm, when, when you were
talkin about our future you said cat, but you meant dog right.
Chandler  Oh yeah, totally!
Monica  Oh good.
[Scene  Joey and Rachel's, Rachel is balancing her checkbook as Joey enters from his
room wearing a hockey helmet, gloves, and shin guards.]
Joey  Hello, Zelda.
Rachel  Who are you supposed to be?
Joey  The vicar!
Rachel  Do you even know what a vicar is?
Joey  Like a goalie, right?
Rachel  (sarcastically) Yeah. Look Joey, its enough all right?! You keep
making these stupid jokes and this sleazy innuendoes and itsIm
notits just not funny anymore!
Joey  All right, Im sorry. Rach IRach Im sorry. Okay? Im
sorry! Maybe I can make up for it by, taking you roughly in the barn. (Giggles.)
Rachel  All right! Yknow what? Thats it! You wanna do it?!
Lets do it!
Joey  Huh?
Rachel  (starting to move closer to him) Thats right, I wanna do it with
you! Ive been trying to fight it, but you just said all the right things.
Joey  (nervously backing away) I-I-I-I did? (He puts a stool in front of her.)
Rachel  (moves the stool out of the way) Yeah! Ohh, Ive been waitin
so long to get on that body!
Joey  This body? (He backs into the kitchen.)
Rachel  Yeah thats right! Come on Joey; sex me up!
Joey  Hey-hey, youre startin to sound like the butchers wife
there in-in chapter seven.
Rachel  Oh, come on now, dont keep me waiting. Get those clothes off! But,
I would keep that helmet on because youre in for a rough ride! (He backs into
the door.)
Joey  I dont want to, Im scared.
[Scene  Central Perk, Rachel, Phoebe, Joey, Ross, and Monica are all there as Chandler
enters wearing glasses.]
Chandler  Hey, you guys!
Ross and Rachel 
Chandler  So, what do you think?
Ross  About what?
Rachel  Yeah, what?
Joey  What?
Chandler  Are you kidding? Okay, Ill give you a hint; Ill give you a
hint. (Points to his glasses.)
Joey  Eyes! No, no. Your eyes! No. Chandlers eyes!
Chandler  I got glasses!
Ross  Well, you-youve always had glasses.
Chandler  No I didnt!
Ross  Are you sure?
Rachel  Yeah-yeah, did-didnt you use to have a pair? They were really
round, burgundy, and they made you look kind of umm
Joey  Feminine.
Rachel  Yes!
Chandler  No!
Monica  Sweetie, I think the glasses look great. They make you look really sexy.
Chandler  Really?
Monica  Yeah!
Chandler  (sitting down on the arm of her chair) You didnt think I used to
wear glasses, right?
Monica  Of course! (She mouths, "I have no idea," to the rest of the
gang.)
[Scene  Monica, Chandler, and Phoebe's, Rachel, Phoebe, Chandler, and Monica are making
some sandwiches.]
Phoebe  So what do you guys want for an engagement present?
Chandler  Thats okay Pheebs, were not having a party or anything, so
you dont have to get us
Monica  (interrupts him) If someone wants to give us a present, we dont
want to deprive them of that joy.
Rachel  Oh, yknow what you should get em? One of those little uh,
portable CD players.
Monica  Oh, I already have one.
Phoebe  Not unless someone borrowed it and left it at the gynecologist.
Rachel  Yeah, and-and-and by someone, she means Joey.
Monica  Hey, I know I what I want!
Chandler  What we want honey.
Monica  No, you dont want this. I want to have your grandmothers
cookie recipe.
Phoebe  You mean the chocolate chip cookie recipe?
Monica  Uh-huh, yeah.
Phoebe  You mean the one that my grandmother made me swear on her deathbed that
I would never let out of our family?
Chandler  Dying people say the craziest things.
Monica  I wanted it for years! I was gonna make cookies for my children.
Phoebe  Break my heartOh, all right.
Monica  Okay. Im gonna be the mom that makes the worlds best
chocolate chip cookies.
Chandler  Our kids are gonna be fat arent they.
Joey  (entering) Ahoy!
Chandler  Hey! Hows the boat?!
Joey  Great! Im finally getting into this sailing stuff.
Monica  Oh, so you finally took it out of the marina huh?
Joey  Why would I do that? It took three guys to get the thing in there!
Phoebe  If you dont sail your boat, what do you do on it?
Joey  Oh, its great! Its a great place to just kinda, sit, hang
around, drink a few beers, eat some chips. (He says that as he sits, hangs around, drinks
a beer, and eats a chip.)
Chandler  Well, its good that you finally have a place to do that.
Rachel  Yknow Joey, I could teach you to sail if you want.
Joey  You could?
Rachel  Yeah! Ive been sailing my whole life. When I was fifteen my dad
bought me my own boat.
Phoebe  Your own boat?
Rachel  What?! What?! He was trying to cheer me up! My pony was sick.
[Scene  Central Perk, Chandler and Monica are there. He takes off his glasses and
starts chewing on the ear piece.]
Chandler  Do you know what I was thinkin?
Monica  What?
Chandler  Nothing, I just like to go like this. (Does it again.)
Ross  (entering from the bathrooms) Hey Chandler, what are you doing tonight?
Chandler  Uh why, do you have a lecture?
Ross  No, why?
Chandler  Then free as a bird. Whats up?
Ross  My dad wanted to know if you wanted to play racquetball with us.
Monica  Wow! Thats great! Dad must really like you, he doesnt ask
just anyone to play.
Ross  Yeah and he didnt really ask for you, he asked for Chancy, I assumed
he meant you.
Chandler  Well, did-did you correct him?
Ross  No, I-I thought it would be more fun this way.
Monica  This is so cool, maybe this is something you can do every week.
Ross  Or you can sit with him on the front porch and make sure no one steals the
trash cans. He does that every week too.
Monica  Oh, just so you know, you-you have to let him win.
Ross  Yeah.
Monica  He hates to lose.
Chandler  Oh no problem, maybe Ill play with my left hand.
Ross  Youre not a lefty?
Chandler  Does anybody know me?!
Monica  Whats wrong Phoebe?
Phoebe  I just went to my old apartment to get you the-the cookie recipe and the
stupid fire burned it up!
Monica  No!! Why didnt you make a copy and-and keep it in a fireproof box
and keep it at least a hundred yards from the original?!!
Phoebe  (pauses as he figures out how to answer that) Because Im normal!
That was the one legacy my grandmother left me, and I know you wanted it as an
engagement present.
Ross  Oh, we have to get you an engagement present?
Chandler  Dont worry about it Pheebs.
Ross  No one got me an engagement present.
Phoebe  Okay, here I wish you health and happiness. (She hands Monica a cookie
in a plastic baggie.)
Chandler  An old cookie?
Monica  (To Chandler) This is what happens when you dont register for
gifts!
Phoebe  See no-no, I made a batch and I froze it, and this is the only one left.
Chandler  We cant accept this.
Phoebe  Why not?
Chandler  Cause its gross.
Monica  No! Wait! I think I can figure out the recipe from this cookie! I do
stuff like this at work all the time.
Phoebe  Really?!
Monica  Yeah! I bet I can do it.
Chandler  Okay, we owe you a present.
Ross  Two! Ive been engaged twice!
[Scene  The Mr. Bowmont (Joeys boat), shes shown to be in one of the
waterways around New York, but in reality shes in a sound stage on the Warner Bros.
lot and we see New York from the water in some rather poor green screen shots. Rachel and
Joey are on board.]
Joey  (drinking a beer) Look at this clown! Just because hes got a bigger
boat he thinks he can take up the whole river. (Yelling) Get out of the way jackass! (To
Rachel) Who names his boat Coast Guard anyway?
Rachel  That is the Coast Guard.
Joey  What are they doing out here? The coasts all the way over there.
(Points to the coast, meanwhile there is coast behind him.)
Rachel  Joey, just ignore the boats all right? Were not finished with the
lesson yet.
Joey  All right.
Rachel  Okay, Im just gonna go over the basic points just one more time,
are you ready?
Joey  Come on Rach, not again. I got it! Okay? Lets start sailing, and I
want to go over there (Points) where that boatload of girls is! (Yelling to them)
Yo-ho-ho!
Rachel  Oh, okay. Is that what you want to do? You wanna go over and give a
little shout out to the old, hot chickas? Okay, lets do that Sailor Joe. Quick
question though, (grabs some of the rigging) whats this called?
Joey  Uh, boat rope.
Rachel  Wrong! How do you get the mainsail up?
Joey  Uhh, rub it?
Rachel  No. What do you do if I say we are coming about?
Joey  Id say, come again. No-no, wait I-I-I know this one, I know this
one, uh
Rachel  Times up, now your dead.
Joey  And deaf!
Rachel  Okay, you just go on and make your little jokey-jokes, but if you do not
know what you are doing out at sea you will die at sea. Am I getting through to you
sailor?! (She punctuates each word by slapping him on the forehead.)
Joey  Yes.
Rachel  Dont just say yes! This isnt a game, Joey you can really get
hurt out here. Okay, so do you want to pay attention or do you want to die?!
Joey  I want to make a ship to shore call to Chandler.
[Scene  Monica, Chandler, and Phoebe's, Monica and Phoebe are trying to determine the
cookie recipe by eating small pieces.]
Monica  All right, I definitely taste nutmeg.
Phoebe  You do?
Monica  You dont? (Laughs) Well, thats the difference between a
professional and a layman.
Phoebe  That and arrogance.
Joey  (entering) Hey.
Monica  Hey! How was sailing?
Joey  I dont want to talk about it. Yknow, you couldve at
least saved me a whole cookie. (He grabs whats left of the cookie and pops in his
mouth.)
Monica and Phoebe 
Joey  (recoils in horror) Women are mean!!! (Storms out.)
Phoebe  I cant believe that! Now the only thing left of my
grandmothers legacy is this crumb. (She picks it up with her finger and holds it out
to Monica.) I wish you a long and happy marriage.
Ross  (entering with Chandler) Hey.
Monica  Hey! How was it?
Ross  Well I had a great time! Umm, Chancy on the other hand
Chandler  I will tell the story! It was going great. I let him win. We
were bonding. He even said I could call him dad.
Ross  And what did he ask you not to call him?
Chandler  Daddy. All right look, heres the story. (Flashback to Chandler
about to enter the steam room as he does the voice-over.) Well, we had just finished
playing racquetball and we were gonna take a steam. I walk into the steam room and it was
really steamy. (The flashback shows his glasses fog up and him trying to find his way
around the steam filled room. He takes off his glasses.) So I take off my glasses and
thats when in happened.
Chandler  Guys?
Ross  Over here. (You can see Ross sitting at the far wall.)
Mr. Geller  Have a seat son. (You can see Mr. Geller sitting closer to the door
as Chandler walks over and sits in his lap.) Hey!! (Chandler quickly jumps off and sits
next to him with a shocked expression on his face.)
[Scene  Monica, Chandler, and Phoebe's, Chandler is finished telling everyone what
happened.]
Monica  Oh my God Chandler! I cant believe it!
Chandler  I know.
Monica  You gave my father a lap dance!
Chandler  Why do they put so much steam in there?!
Ross  Cause otherwise theyd have to call it the room room.
Chandler  Why? Okay? Why? Wh-wh-why did that have to happen?
Phoebe  Come on, its not that big a deal!
Chandler  Not that big a deal? Therethere was touching of things.
Ross  Now, I know you wanted to bond with my dad, but did you really have to
bond to that part?
Monica  Listen, Im sure that dad doesnt care. He probably thought
this was funny; hell be telling this story for years!
Chandler  I dont want him to tell this story for years.
Ross  Oh, but he will. He still tells the story how Monica tried to escape from
fat camp.
Monica  I wasnt escaping.
Ross  Then how did you get caught in the barbed wire?
Monica  I was trying to help out a squirrel.
Ross  You were trying to eat it!
Chandler  If that is your father calling to tell this story then the
marriage is off!
Monica  (takes the phone from Ross) Come on. (Answering phone) Hello? (Listens)
Im sorry you have the wrong number. (Listens) (Whispering) Okay, Ill call you
later dad. I love you. (Hangs up.)
[Scene  Central Perk, Chandler, Ross, and Rachel are there.]
Chandler  (getting up) All right, Im off to see your dad.
Ross  Whoa-whoa, arent you a little over dressed?
Rachel  (laughing) Yeah, and-and you better make sure he tips you this time.
Chandler  Look, I figured I would try to convince him not to tell the story
anymore, and I figure the best way to do that is face to faceAnd by face I
dont mean his lap. And by face, I dont mean my ass. (Exits.)
Ross  (To Rachel) Hey are you getting Monica and Chandler an engagement present?
Rachel  I dont know. Yknow, they didnt get us anything.
Ross  Thank you!
Joey  (entering) Hey.
Ross  Hey.
Rachel  Well hello! So, when are we gettin back out on the water matey?
Joey  Oh uh, I dont know the boat way to say this, but uh never!
Rachel  Why not?
Joey  Because! Youre mean on the boat!
Rachel  What? I was just trying to teach you.
Joey  Well, lesson learned! Rachel is mean!
Ross  Yeeeeeep Yep-yep-yep-yep-yep. I remember when she took out on her
dads boat she wouldnt let me help at all.
Rachel  Excuse me, I wanted you to help, but you couldnt move your arms
because you were wearing three life jackets.
Ross  You have to respect the sea! (Storms off.)
Rachel  Look Joey, Im sorry if-if you thought that was mean, but I gotta
tell ya something. That was not mean. Okay, my father is mean. He used to yell at me all
the time on the boat, I mean it was horrible. I was just being a good teacher.
Joey  Does a good teacher say, "Put down the beer pinhead!?"
Rachel  Well, does a good student drink seven beers during his first lesson?
Joey  Six and a half! You knocked that last one out of my hand! Remember?
Rachel  Yeah, I didnt want you to get hit by the boom!
Joey  Well it hit me anyway! And it wouldve hurt a lot less if I had
finished that last beer.
Rachel  All right, yknow what? I-Im sorry. I will try to tone it
down and uh stop yelling.
Joey  You wont boss me around anymore?
Rachel  I wont boss you around.
Joey  And youll be nice?
Rachel  And, Ill be nice.
Joey  And youll be topless?
Rachel  AndJoey!
Joey  Do you want me to learn?!
[Scene  Monica, Chandler, and Phoebe's, Monica is trying out different cookie recipes.
Ross and Phoebe are the tasting group.]
Monica  Okay, heres batch 22. Ohh, maybe thesell taste a little like
your grandmothers. This has a little bit of orange peel, but no nutmeg.
Ross  Lets give it a shot.
Monica  Okay. Man, I have not made this many cookies since I was in the
ninth grade.
Phoebe  Oh, what was that for? Like a bake sale?
Monica  No, just a Friday night.
Ross  Ohh, these are pretty good.
Phoebe  Yeah, but not as good as batch 17.
Ross  Which one was that?
Monica  The ones we had right after you almost threw up.
Ross  Oh yeah! Batch 17 was good. I did not like batch 16. (Burps a
little bit.) Im okay.
Phoebe  Are there anymore from the good batch? Cause we could just work
off of those.
Ross  Yeah, ooh yeah, I think there is one from batch 17 left, uh (Grabs a
cookie and takes a big bite out of it and doesnt like it.) Its batch 16! 16
people! Get out of the way! (Gets up and runs for the bathroom.)
[Scene  The Mr. Bowmont, its Joeys second lesson with Rachel as the resident
sailing expert.]
Rachel  Okay Joey honey, youre doing really good! All right, now Im
just gonna need you to step to the port side. (Joey pauses as he tries to remember which
side is the port side.) Remember? Remember how we talked about the port side?
Joey  Ohh yeah.
Rachel  Right?
Joey  Nope.
Rachel  Its left sweetie, but thats okay sweetie, thats a
tough one.
Joey  I dont know why you just dont say left.
Rachel  Okay, go to the left. (Joey goes starboard or sits on the right side of
the boat.) The left!
Joey  Huh?
Rachel  (yelling) Just sit over there!! (Points to the port side.)
Joey  (hurrying over) Okay! Okay, youre yelling again! See that?
Rachel  No! No-no, no-no-no, very quiet, said with love, no yelling.
Joey  Oh, yknow what? Since Im here, I think Im gonna have me
a little beer on the port side. (Grabs and opens one.)
Rachel  Okay Joey, were luffing a little bit, so could you tighten up the
cunningham? (The mainsail has started to flap in the wind and has stopped working
efficiently; she wants him to tighten it so that it starts working again.)
Joey  Uh, wow, you just said a bunch of stuff I didnt know there.
Rachel  Joey, come on! We just went over this! (She does it instead.)
Joey  Oh, yknow, when we did that was when that bird was flying overhead
with the fish in his mouth. Did you see it? It was gross!
Rachel  (angrily) No! All right?! I did not see the bird! I did not
see the fish! I did not see the piece of Styrofoam that was shaped like Mike Tyson!
I did not, because I was trying to teach you how to sail a boat! Which
obviously is an impossible thing to do!
Joey  All right thats it! Youre yelling and I dont see you
taking your top off! I quit!
Rachel  What do you mean you quit?! You cant quit!
Joey  Why not?!
Rachel  Because youre not finished yet and I wont have it! Greens do
not quit!
Joey  Greens? Im a Tribbiani! And Tribbianis quit!
Rachel  Oh my God, wait did II just said Greens dont quit
didnt I? (Pause) (Angrily) Did I just say Greens dont quit?!
Joey  Yes! Yes! You did and youre still yelling at me!
Rachel  No! No! No! Im not yelling at you, Im just yelling near you.
Oh God Joey, ohh Im my father. Oh my God, this is horrible! Ive been trying so
hard not to be my mother I did not see this comin. Oh, Joey, Im sorry.
Im so sorry. I just wanted you to learn.
Joey  Well, hey I did learn.
Rachel  Really?
Joey  Yeah! Come on.
Rachel  Awww
Joey  Yeah, its okay. I know what a mainsail is. (Points to it. Its
the larger sail.) I know, I know to duck when the boom comes across. I-I know port is
right.
Rachel  Left.
Joey  Damnit!
[Scene  Monica, Chandler, and Phoebe's, the cookie trying period has pasted. Monica,
Phoebe, and Ross are reflecting on the days events.]
Phoebe  Yknow, I bet it would actually make my grandmother very happy to
know that were trying to figure out her recipe. I bet shes l-l-lookin up
at us and smiling right now.
Ross  Looking up?
Phoebe  Oh yeahNo, she was really nice to me, but shes in hell for
sure.
Monica  Well, Ive tried everything. I give up. I guess Im not gonna
be the mom who makes the worlds best chocolate cookies. I do make the best duck
confit with broccoli rabe.  Kids love that right.
Ross  Aww, Pheeb, come on isnt there any relative that would have the
recipe? What about, what about your sister?
Phoebe  Oh no-no, no, I made a promise to myself that the next time I would talk
to Ursula would be over my dead body. And thats not happening til October 15th,
2032.
Ross  Thats the day youre gonna die? Seedarnit, Ive got
shuffleboard that day.
Phoebe  Thats what you think.
Monica  Well, I mean what about friends of your grandmothers?
Wouldnt they have the recipe?
Phoebe  Well, yknow I may have relatives in France who would know. My
grandmother said she got the recipe from her grandmother, Nesele Tolouse.
Monica  What was her name?
Phoebe  Nesele Toulouse.
Monica  Nestle Tollhouse?!
Phoebe  Oh, you Americans always butcher the French language.
Monica  (grabbing a bag of Nestle Tollhouse chocolate chips) Phoebe, is this
the recipe? (Tosses her the bag.)
Phoebe  (reading the recipe on the back of the bag) Yes!! (Realizes.) Ohh.
Monica  I cannot believe that I just spent the last two days trying to figure
out the recipe and it was in my cupboard the whole time!
Phoebe  I know! You see it is stuff like this which is why (Looking down)
youre burning in hell!!
[Scene  The Gym, Chandler and Mr. Geller are heading for the whirlpool room.]
Chandler  So you understand, Id feel a lot more comfortable if you
didnt tell people what happened. Yknow, Im a littleIm a
little embarrassed about it.
Mr. Geller  I understand completely, theres nothing more horrifying than
embarrassing yourself in front of your in-laws. As a matter of fact, when I started dating
Judy I was unemployed, and her father asked me what I did for a living and I told him I
was a lawyer.
Chandler  What did you do when they found out?
Mr. Geller  They never did, so if ever see me giving them legal advice just nod
along. Shall we?
Chandler  So I guess we wear swimsuits in here!
[Scene  The Mr. Bowmont, is tied up alongside the pier; Joey and Rachel are relaxing.]
Rachel  Well Joey, I hate to admit it, your way of sailing is a lot more fun.
Joey  Yeah, yeah. Hey, why dont you give a pull on that rope? (Points.)
Rachel  Ohh were not sailing.
Joey  Just pull on it.
Rachel  All right. (She does so and it brings the cooler closer together.)
Hey-hey-hey!! (Sees whats in the cooler.) Sandwiches!
Joey  What else?
Rachel  (hands him one) Here you go.
Joey  Thank you.
Rachel  Oh wow! (She takes a bite, but holds the sandwich vertically so that the
stuff falls out.)
Joey  What are you doing?
Rachel  Ohh, sorry.
Joey  What youdont hold it like that! Youre lettin all
the good stuff fall out.
Rachel  Ohh whoops.
Joey  Careful! Youre wasting good pastrami! (Gasps.) Oh my God! Im my
dad!

watching the first episode of Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E. Joey is of course Mac.]
Mac  (on TV) Well, if we learned one thing today C.H.E.E.S.E. is that
cheerleaders and high explosives dont mix. (Cut to Joey laughing while Rachel,
Chandler, and Monica arent amused.)
C.H.E.E.S.E  You can say that again Mac.
Mac  Well, I couldnt have done it without you buddy. Youre a genius.
Joey  (laughing and turning off the TV) So, what did you guys think?
Monica  (on phone) Hello? (Listens) Hold on please. Joey, its your mom.
(Hands him the phone.)
Chandler  Its your mommy. Its your mommy.
Ross  Ohhhh
Rachel  Thats nice.
Joey  (on phone) Mom, so what did you think? (He walks away allowing the gang a
chance to figure out what theyre gonna say.)
Rachel  Well that was ummOkay.
Ross  It wasnt the best.
Chandler  That was one of the worse things ever. And not just on TV.
Monica  Wh-what are we gonna tell him?
Ross  Well, the lighting was okay.
Rachel  Ohh no you dont! You got lighting last time, lighting is mine!
Monica  And I have costumes.
Ross  Oh great! That means Im stuck with, "So, we were watching you
in there (Points to the TV) and you were sittin right here! Whoa!"
Rachel  What are you gonna do Pheebs?
Phoebe  I dont know. I dont know. I cant lie to him again. Oh
no Ino! Im just gonna press my breasts up against him.
Chandler  And say nothing?
Phoebe  Uh-huh, yeah thats right.
Joey  (hangs up the phone) Wow! Well, my folks really liked it! So what-what did
you guys think? (Phoebe smiles, walks up to him, and presses her breasts against him.) It
wasnt that good.
[Scene  Central Perk, Phoebe and Monica are reading on the couch.]
Monica  Phoebe, do you think that your favorite animal says much about you?
Phoebe  What? You mean behind my back?
Rachel  (entering, excitedly) Oh! Hi you guys, oh my God! Youll never
gonna believe happened to me today! I am sitting in my office and
Joey  (entering from bathrooms excitedly) You guys! You guys! Youre not
gonna believe what my agent just told me!
Rachel  Joey! Kinda in the middle of a story here!
Joey  Ooh, sorry. Sorry. You finish, go.
Rachel  Okay, so anyway Im sittin in my office and guess who walks
in.
Joey  Im gonna be on two TV shows!
Monica and Phoebe 
Rachel  Joey!
Joey  Oh, you werent finished?
Rachel  Yeah! Guess who walks into my office is the end of my story. (To Monica
and Phoebe) It was Ralph Lauren! (Monica and Phoebe gasp) Ralph Lauren walked into my
office!
Joey  Uh Rach, if youre gonna start another story, at least let me finish
mine.
Rachel  Its the same story.
Joey  (groans in disgust) Wow, its really long.
Rachel  (ignoring him) Anyway, Ralph just came in to tell me that hes so
happy with my work that he wants me to be the new merchandising manager for polo retail.
Monica  Still get a discount on wedding dresses?
Rachel  Yeah!
Monica  Im so happy for you!
Joey  Well, these really are the days of our lives.
Monica  What?!
Joey  Well, since you ask. They want me back on Days of Our Lives!
Phoebe  (gasps) Oh God!
Rachel  I gotI get a big pay raise!
Phoebe  Oh hey!
Joey  Ill be playing Drake Remorays twin brother, Stryker!
Monica  Oooh!
Rachel  I get to hire my own assistant!
Monica and Phoebe 
Joey  (jumps up) WellI got a head rush from standing up to fast right
there.
[Scene  Rachels New Office, shes interviewing a potential new assistant,
Hilda.]
Rachel  (reading the resume) And you were at this job for four years?
Hilda  Thats right.
Rachel  Okay, well this is all very impressive Hilda, um I just have one last
question for you. Uh, how did I do? Was this okay?
Hilda  What?
Rachel  Ive never interviewed anyone before. Ive actually never had
anyone work for me before. Although when I was a kid, we did have a maid, but this
is-this isnt the same thing.
Hilda  No dear. Its not.
Rachel  No. Yeah, and I know that. All right, well thank you so much for coming
in it was nice to meet you.
Hilda  Thank you! Good meeting you.
Rachel  All right. (Hilda exits) Im a total pro!
Man  Hello?
Rachel  (seeing him) Wow! H-umm! Hi! Yes, uh Im sorry the models are
actually down the hall.
Man  Actually, Im here about the assistant job.
Rachel  Really?! (Taking his resume) Okay well then, all right, well just have a
seat there. Umm, so whatswhat iswhats your name?
Man  Tag Jones.
Rachel  Uh-huh, go on.
Tag  Thats it. Thats my whole name.
Rachel  Thats your whole name, okay of course it is! Okay, well
lets-lets just have a look-see here. (Looking at his resume)
Tag  I know I havent worked in an office before, and I really dont
have a lot of experience, but uh
Rachel  Oh come on, what are you talking about? Youve got three years
painting houses. Two whole summers at T.G.I. Fridays, come on!
Tag  Its lame, I know. But Im a goal-oriented person, very eager to
learn
Rachel  Okay, hold on just a second. (She grabs a camera out of the desk and
takes his picture.) Im sorry, its for human resources, everybody has to do it.
Could you just stand up please?
[Scene  Central Perk, Chandler is sitting on the couch when some unknown guy comes in
and sits in their easy chair.]
Chandler  No-no-no-no. (Waves him away as Monica and Phoebe enter whispering to
each other.) Hey! (Monica shushes him.)
Phoebe  (To Monica) Anyway, I should go. Okay, bye.
Monica  (To Chandler) Hey sweetie.
Chandler  Hi sweetie. So, what was with all the whispering?
Monica  I cant tell you. Its a secret.
Chandler  Secret? Married people arent supposed to have secrets between
one another. We have too much love and respect for one another.
Monica  Awww. (Kisses him.) But still no.
Chandler  No Im serious, we should tell each other everything. I do
not have any secrets from you.
Monica  Really? Okay, so why dont you tell me what happened to Ross Junior
year at Disneyland?
Chandler  Oh no-no, I cant do that.
Monica  If you tell me, Ill tell you what Phoebe said.
Chandler  Okay.
Monica  Okay.
Chandler  So, Ross and I are going to Disneyland and we stop at this
restaurant for tacos. And when I say restaurant, I mean a guy, a hibachi, and the trunk of
his car. So Ross has about 10 tacos. And anyway, were on Space Mountain and
Ross starts to feel a little iffy.
Monica  Oh my God. He threw up?
Chandler  No, he visited a little town south of throw up. (Monica laughs
hysterically.) So what was Phoebes secret?
Monica  Oh, Nancy Thompson from Phoebes old massage place is getting
fired.
Chandler  Thats it?! I gave up my Disneyland story for that?
Monica  Thats right! You lose sucker!! (Pause) Please still marry me.
[Scene  Monica, Chandler, and Phoebe's, Chandler, Rachel, and Phoebe are there.]
Rachel  Chandler, you have an assistant right?
Chandler  (angrily) Did she call? You-you told her I was sick right? Always tell
her I am sick!
Rachel  No, I-I just dont know how you decide who to hire. I mean
Ive got it narrowed down to two people. One of them has great references and a lot
of experience and then theres this guy
Chandler  What about him?
Rachel  I love him. Hes so pretty I wanna cry! I dont know what to
do. Tell me what to do.
Phoebe  Come on you know what to do! You hire the first one! You dont hire
an assistant because theyre cute, you hire them because theyre qualified.
Rachel  Uh-huh. No, I hear what youre saying and-and-and that makes a lot
of sense but can I just say one more thing? (Takes out his picture.) Look how pretty!
Phoebe  Lets see. (Looking at the picture) Oh my God! Oh But no! No!
You cant-you cant hire him, because thatits not professional. Umm,
this is for me (The picture) yes? Thanks. (Puts it in her pocket.)
Rachel  Okay youre right. Ill hire Hilda tomorrow. Dumb old perfect
for the job Hilda!
Chandler  Let me see this guy. (Phoebe hands him the picture.) W-H-Wow!
Dont show this to Monica! And dont tell her about the W-H-Wow!
[Scene  The Days of Our Lives producers office, Joey is entering to find
Terry there.]
Terry  Hey-hey-hey Joey!
Joey  Hey Terry!
Terry  Good to see you again!
Joey  Its been a while, huh? Wow, its funny these halls look smaller
then they used to.
Terry  Its a different building.
Joey  So! Stryker Remoray huh? When do you want me to start?
Terry  Why dont we start right now!
Joey  Okay.
Terry  Here are the audition scenes. (Holds out the script.)
Joey  (looking between the pages and him) Audition? I thought you were gonna
offer me the part.
Terry  Why would you think that?
Joey  Well, I was Dr. Drake Remoray, Strykers twin brother. I mean, who
looks more me than me right?
Terry  Everybody has to audition.
Joey  Yknow Terry, I-I dont really need to do this. I got my
own cable TV series, (Pause) with a robot.
Terry  Im sorry Joey thatsthats the way it is.
Joey  Well. I guess you think youre pretty special huh? Sittin up
here in your fancy small hall building. Makin stars jump through hoops for ya, huh?
Well yknow what? (Throws the script away) This is one star whos hoop
This is a star that the hoopthis hoopI was Dr. Drake Remoray!
[Scene  Rachels office, shes there as Tag knocks on the door and enters
carrying a plant.]
Rachel  Hi! Tag. What are you doing here?
Tag  I just wanted to come by and thank you for not laughing in my face
yesterday. And I noticed there arent any plants in your office so I wanted to bring
you your first (Notices her plant) There is a plant in your office.
Rachel  Kinda.
Tag  Right. So I guess I shouldnt put good at noticing stuff on my resume.
(Sets the plant down on her desk.)
Rachel  Oh-ohh, thank you.
Tag  Anyway, Im guessing you hired somebody.
Rachel  Well
Tag  Gotcha. Thanks again for meeting with me. (Starts to leave.)
Rachel  But I hired you!
Tag  What?
Rachel  Yeah! You-you got the job! Youre my new assistant!
Tag  I am?!
Rachel  Yeah!
Tag  I cant believe it!
Rachel  Me either. Umm, all right, first thing I need you to do is go downstairs
and find a women named Hilda and tell her to go home.
[Scene  Monica, Chandler, and Phoebe's, Monica is setting the table for dinner as
Chandler enters.]
Chandler  Hey.
Monica  Hey! Good, youre home!
Chandler  Oh its always nicer to here than, "Aw crap! You
again!"
Monica  Hey baby. (Kisses him.)
Chandler  Hey.
Monica  I made you a surprise.
Chandler  Oh yeah?
Monica  Yeah, tacos! Ever since you told me that story Ive had such a
craving for them.
Chandler  Did you not understand the story?
Ross  (entering) Hey!
Chandler  Hey! Whats up?
Monica  Ross!
Ross  Oh, nothin much. Just trying to figure out what Im gonna do
for dinner.
Chandler  Huh.
Ross  (notices the table) HeyOoh! Whats-whats that, dinner
stuff? You making dinner?
Chandler  No! (The oven dings.) Shhh!
Ross  What you got over there? Tacos?
Monica  No! No. Theyre umm Theyre just uhground beef
smileys. (Holding up one of the shells.)
Ross  Uhh, those are tacos.
Monica  Excuse me Mr. Mexico.
Ross  Eh, either way Ill pass. (Quietly to Chandler) I still cant
eat those. (Monica is getting something out of the fridge and starts laughing.)
Whats so funny?!
Monica  (trying not to laugh) Im not laughing.
Ross  (To Chandler) You told her!
Chandler  Nancy Thompsons getting fired! (Monica slaps him on the
shoulder.)
Ross  (To Monica) Look, okay-okay I had food poisoning! Its not like I
choose to do it! Its not likeIts not like I said, "Umm, what would
make this ride more fun?!"
Monica  Youre right. I mean Im sorry. Yeah, I shouldnt be
laughing. I should be laying down papers for you! (Runs off laughing which gets Chandler
laughing.)
Ross  (To Chandler) How could you tell her?!
Chandler  I had too okay?! Were getting married! Married couples
cant keep secrets from one another!
Ross  Oh really? Well I-I guess Monica should know about Atlantic City.
Chandler  Du-ude!
Monica  (running up to Ross) What happened in Atlantic City?!
Ross  Well, Chandler and I are in a bar
Chandler  Did you not hear me say, "Du-ude?!"
Ross  And this girl is making eyes at Chandler, okay? So after awhile he-he goes
over to her and uh, after a minute or two, I see them kissing. Now, I know what
youre thinking, Chandlers not the type of guy who just goes to bars and makes
out with girls, and youre right, Chandlers not the type of guy who just goes
to bars and makes out withgirls.
Monica  (To Chandler) You kissed a guy?!! Oh my God.
Chandler  In my defense, it was dark and he was a very pretty guy.
Ross  Oh Mon, I laughed so hard
Chandler  Ho-ho, so hard we had to throw out your underwear again?
Ross  Whatever dude, you kissed a guy.
[Scene  Joey and Rachel's, Phoebe is giving Joey a massage as Rachel enters.]
Rachel  Hi!
Joey  Hey.

Rachel  Ohh, my new assistant is working out, yes.
Joey  Was she happy you gave her the job?
Rachel  Oh, my-my new assistant has very happy that I hired my new assistant.
Joey  (on phone) Hello? (Listens) Oh hey! Can you, can you hang on a second? (To
Phoebe and Rachel) Its the producers over at Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E. can you excuse me
for a minute? (On phone) Hey, funny you should call. I was just looking over next
weeks script. (Listens) Canceled?! (Listens) Like theyre taking it off the
air? (Listens) Ohh. (Listens) All right, see you Monday. (Listens) Were not even
shootin them anymore?!! (Listens) All right, bye! (Hangs up) They canceled Mac and
C.H.E.E.S.E!
Phoebe  Sorry.
Rachel  Im sorry Joey.
Joey  Why would they do that?! It was a good show right?!
[Scene  Monica, Chandler, and Phoebe's, Chandler, Monica, and Ross are still giving
away all of their secrets.]
Chandler  You wanna tell secrets?! Okay! Okay! In college, Ross used to wear leg
warmers!
Ross  All right! All right! Chandler entered a Vanilla Ice look-a-like contest
and won!
Chandler  Ross came in forth and cried!
Monica  Oh my God! (Laughing)
Ross  Oh, is that funny?! Oh, you-you find that funny?! Well maybe Chandler
should know some of your secrets too!
Monica  I-I already told him everything! (Threateningly) You shush!!
Ross  Once Monica was sent to her room without dinner, so she ate the macaroni
off a jewelry box shed made.
Monica  Ross used to stay up every Saturday night to watch Golden
Girls!
Ross  Monica couldnt tell time til she was 13!
Monica  Its hard for some people!
Chandler  (To Monica) Of course it is. (Mouths to Ross) Wowwhoa!
Monica  Chandler one time wore my underwear to work!
Chandler  Hey!!!
Monica  Ohh, Im sorry I couldnt think of anymore for Ross!
Ross  Ohh! Ohh! In college, Chandler got drunk and slept with the lady who
cleaned our dorm!
Chandler  That was you!
Ross  Whatever dude, you kissed a guy.
[Scene  Joey and Rachel's, Joey is still bumming about cancellation of Mac and
C.H.E.E.S.E.]
Joey  How could this happen to me?! Yesterday I had two TV shows! Today,
I got nothin!
Rachel  Well wait a minute, what happened to Days of Our Lives?
Joey  Uh, well they might be a little mad at me over there.
Phoebe  What happened?
Joey  Well maybe I got a little upset and maybe I told them where they could go.
Rachel  Joey, why would you do that?
Joey  Because they wanted me to audition!
Phoebe  You! An actor?! Thats madness!
[Scene  Rachels Outer Office, Tag is sitting at his desk as Rachel walks up. She
stops and watches him pick up the phone.]
Tag  Rachel Greens office. (Hangs up.)
Rachel  Tag? (He turns and looks at her.) Hi, who was that?
Tag  (shyly) Nobody. I was just practicing.
Rachel  Really? (Giggles.)
Phoebe  Hi!
Tag  Hi! Rachel Greens office.
Phoebe  You must be Hilda.
Rachel  Yeah, this is Tag. Tag, this is Phoebe. Phoebe, can I see you for a
second? (Goes into office.)
Tag  Phoebe! Thats a great name.
Phoebe  Oh, you like that? You should hear my phone number.
Rachel  (grabbing Phoebe) Okay. Well be right back. (They go into her
office and she closes the door.)
Phoebe  So you hired yourself a little treat did ya?
Rachel  All right I know, I know how it looks Pheebs, but Im telling
you
Phoebe  But-but you know you cannot get involved with your assistant.
Rachel  Yes, I know that. I know that. And I know that hiring him was probably
not the smartest thing that Ive ever done. But Im telling you, from this
moment on I swear this is strictly professional. (Theres a knock on the door.) Yes?
Kathy  Hey Rachel!
Rachel  Hi!
Kathy  Cute assistant! Whats his story? Is he
Rachel  Gay? Yeah. (Kathy leaves dejectedly.)
[Scene  Terrys office, Joey has come to beg for a second chance.]
Joey  Hey! Terry.
Terry  Joey Tribbiani! Im surprised your big head could fit through our
small halls! (Gets up) I gotta go Joey.
Joey  Wait! Terry! WaitLookWait I-I Look, Im really
sorry about before. I was an idiot thinking Im too big to audition for you. You
gotta give me another chance.
Terry  I cant help you Joey.
Joey  Wait! Terry! Please! Look, I just lost my other job. Okay? You have no
idea how much I need this. Please, help me out, for old times sake.
Nurse #1  This poor guys been in a coma for five years. Its
hopeless.
Nurse #2  Its not hopeless! Dr. Stryker Remorays a miracle worker.
Look, here he comes.
Dr. Stryker Remoray  Good morning. (He walks over to the bed, leans down, and
whispers to him.) Drake, its your brother Stryker. Can you hear me?
The Director 
Joey  (jumping up and removing the bandages) Im back baby! Ha-ha-ha!
[Scene  Central Perk, Chandler, Monica, and Ross are sitting there and not talking to
each other.]
Monica  Yknow, in my defense, umm there was no glitter on the macaroni and
very little glue.
Ross  And in my defense, the cleaning lady came on to me!
Chandler  (To Monica) You have no trouble telling time now right?
Monica  No!
Chandler  Quick! What time is it?! (Holds his watch in front of her face.)
Monica  I dont know! Time to kiss a guy maybe?! (Ross laughs.) What are
you laughing at Pampers? (He stops laughing and glares at her.)
Chandler  Yknow when I said that because were getting married that
we should share everything and not have any secrets?
Monica  Yeah?
Chandler  Yeah that was stupid. Lets not do that.
Monica  Ohh, absolutely.
Ross  And! We should keep all the stuff uh, we told each other secret from
everybody else.
Monica  Yeah, definitely!
Ross  Okay, (gets up) if youll excuse me, I-Im gonna go hang out
with some people who dont know the Space Mountain story.
Monica  Then, Id steer clear of Phoebe.
Ross  Man! (Monica mouths, "Im sorry.")
Chandler  Yeah, and not that you would, but I wouldnt hang out
withall the guys in my office.
[Scene  Rachels office, shes looking at a picture of Tag when he knocks and
enters.]
Rachel  (noticing him) Hi! (Puts the pictures away.)
Tag  Do you have a minute?
Rachel  Well yeah, sure, whats up?
Tag  I got asked out twice today when I was at lunchby guys.
Rachel  Oh really?!
Tag  Yeah. Did you tell someone that I was gay?
Rachel  Oh, did you not want people to know that?
Tag  But Im not gay. And I especially wouldnt want you to think I
was gay.
Rachel  Whys that?
Tag  I dont think I should say.
Rachel  Ohh, you can say. Come on, I dont want you to feel like you
cant tell me things. (Motions for him to sit down.)
Tag  Okay.
Rachel  Kay.
Tag  Well
Rachel  Yeah.
Tag  Id love to ask out your friend Phoebe.
Rachel  (Pause) Yeah, shes gay.

Chandler  Hey.
Monica  Whats the matter?
Chandler  Someone on the subway licked my neck! Licked my neck!!
Phoebe  Oh Willies still alive!
Chandler  What are you guys doing?
Monica  Oh, my mom called, theyre gonna run our engagement announcement in
the local paper, so were looking for a good picture of us.
Chandler  Oooh, Im afraid that does not exist.
Monica  Thats not true, there are great pictures of us!
Chandler  No, there are great pictures of you standing next to a guy whos
going like this (Makes what can only be described as a toothy frown. Henceforth,
this shall be known as The Face.)
Phoebe  Oh my God! Thats the creep that youre with at the Statue
of Liberty.
Chandler  I dont know what it is, I just cant take a good picture.
Monica  (looking at one) Oh, heres a great one.
Chandler  Yeah, Im not in that.
Monica  I know, but look at me all tan.
Phoebe  Hey, why dont you guys go, get portraits done by a professional
photographer.
Monica  Thats a good idea! I bet they have one of those wind machines!
Yknow (Does the whole hair blowing in the wind model type poses.)
Phoebe  Yeah thats great! Next to that, Chandler wont look so
stupid.
Monica  Chandler what do you say?
Chandler  All right, but I should warn you, Im not going. Im going.
(Does The Face while saying that last part.)
[Scene  Central Perk, Rachel is siting on the couch as Ross and Chandler enter after
playing basketball.]
Ross  (To Chandler) Dude, that reverse lay-up! Oh
Chandler  How about those three pointers?
Ross  Amazing!
Chandler  And those guys were this (Doing the standard "This
Close" gesture) close to lettin us play this time too.
Rachel  Hey look-look, Phoebes talking to uh, Cute Coffeehouse Guy.
Ross  Oh, you guys call him Cute Coffeehouse Guy, we call him Hums While He
Pees.
Chandler  Yes, and we call Ross Lingers In The Bathroom.
Phoebe  (returning) Hey you guys, Hums While He Pees just asked me out!
Rachel  Hey, I thought that guy was married.
Phoebe  He is! But hes getting divorcedRoss! Maybe you know him.
Ross  Its not a club.
Rachel  Phoebe, if this guys going through a divorce, is it such a good
idea to start going out with him?
Ross  Hey, divorced men are not bad men!
Chandler  They have that on the napkins at the club.
Rachel  Oh, I gotta get back to work.
Phoebe  You dont have to be back for a half-hour!
Rachel  Yeah but, my assistant Tag does sit-ups in the office during lunch. Ohh!
I could just spread him on a cracker.
Chandler  Rach, if you have a crush on this guy, why would you hire him? I mean
yknow you cant date him right?
Rachel  Oh no, I know that. I know that. Although, we made a joke that we spend
so much time together he should call me his work wife.
Ross  Soon hell be able to call you, that lady he knew who got fired.
Rachel  I am not gonna get fired, because Im not gonna act on it.
Phoebe  So you wouldnt mind if he was dating someone else?
Rachel  Why? Is he? He is! Isnt he? Hes dating that slut in
marketing!
Ross  Maybe I should open a divorced mens club.
Chandler  Dude that is so sad.
Ross  I could put uh-uh a basketball court in the back.
Chandler  Could I play?
[Scene  Rachels Outer Office, shes returning from lunch to see Tag not
doing his sit-ups.]
Rachel  Oh, no sit-ups today Tag?
Tag  I just did them.
Rachel  Oh, well drop and give me ten more!
Tag  What?
Rachel  Uh, I-I had a drink with lunch. Did those cost reports come in?
Tag  Yeah, I filled them out last night?
Rachel  Oh, great could you make me four copies of those?
Melissa  Hey Rachel!
Rachel  (startled) Ahh, hi! Hi! Melissa, whats up? Im just uh, about
to umm, go out to the store to get some stuff to put in my backpack. Yknow, like
dried fruit and granola and stuff. Whats up? (She has put on the backpack.)
Melissa  Umm, is Tag here?
Rachel  No. Why?
Melissa  Oh, I was gonna talk to him about doing something tonight.
Rachel  Really?! Got a little crush on Tag there do ya?
Melissa  Well, weve been flirting back and forth, but I was hoping that
tonight it would turn into something a little more than that.
Rachel  Okay, whoa-whoa easy there Melissa! This aint a locker room, okay?
But, yknow I remember him saying that-that he had plans tonight.
Melissa  Oh no!
Rachel  Oh yeah. All right, back to work.
Melissa  Hey! Isnt that Tags backpack.
Rachel  Yeah Melissa, I dont want to be known as the uh, office bitch, but
I will call your supervisor.
[Scene  A Portrait Studio, Chandler and Monica are trying to take their engagement
picture. Monica has a beautiful smile, while Chandler isnt.]
The Photographer  (taking pictures) Great! Thats great Monica! Great! Now,
Chandler, you want to give us a smile?
Chandler  Okay. (Does The Face.)
The Photographer  Im sorry, is the seat uncomfortable?
Chandler  No, I am.
Monica  Chandler, listen to me sweetie, I know you can do this. Okay? You have a
beautiful smile.
Chandler  I do? (He smiles, beautifully.)
Monica  Yeah! (They turn to the camera, and Chandler does The Face again.) All
right, maybe you dont have to smile. Lets try something else. Lets try
umm, try looking sexy.
Chandler  Okay. (Youll have to see it, I cant describe the face he
makes, but it isnt good.)
Monica  Or not.
[Scene  Rachels Office, Joey is knocking on the door holding a hand over a spot
on his shirt.]
Rachel  Hi Joey! What are you doing here?
Joey  Uhh, well Ive got an audition down the street and I spilled sauce
all over the front of my shirt. (Removes his hand to reveal a huge sauce stain.) You got
an extra one?
Rachel  Yeah, sure. Ummhere. (Hands him one.)
Joey  Great. (He doesnt like it.) You got anything thats not Ralph
Lauren?
Rachel  Yeah, I dont think so Joe.
Joey  All right, I guess this will be fine.
Rachel  Hey, listen umm, what-what are you doing tonight?
Joey  Nothing, why?
Rachel  How would you feel about taking out my assistant Tag? Ill pay.
Joey  Huh, Rach I got to say its gonna take a lot of money for me to go
out on a date with a dude.
Rachel  Im not asking you to go on a date with him!
Joey  Really? Cause I could kinda use the money.
Rachel  Joey, just-just he-hes new in town and I know he doesnt have
any guy friends. Just take him to like a ball game or something. Ill really
appreciate it.
Joey  Yeah, okay.
Rachel  Yeah?
Joey  Sure, no problem. (Sees something.) OohHey, donuts!
Rachel  Yeah!
Joey  Okay. (He grabs a jelly donut, takes a bite, and guess what he spills all
over himself. He tries to clean it up and smears it all over the shirt.)
[Scene  A Portrait Studio, Chandler and Monica are still trying to get the picture
taken.]
Monica  I know. Lets try a lookof far offwonderment. Okay,
well-well gaze into our future and well think about our marriage and the
days to come. (Chandler is still not getting it.) Chandler! What is the matter with your
face?! I mean this picture is supposed to say "Geller and Bing to be married,"
not "Local woman saves drowning moron!" (The photographer laughs.) Hey!
Dont laugh at him! Hes my drowning moron!
Chandler  Aww! (Smiles.)
Monica  Thats it! Take it! Take it! Take it!
[Scene  Central Perk, Chandler, Monica, and Ross are going over the picture proofs.]
Ross  I like this one. (Points to it.) It seems to say, "I love you and
thats why I have to kill you."
Monica  They cant all be bad. (To Chandler) Find the one where you make
your bedroom eyes. Ohh, there it is.
Chandler  Oh my God! Those are my bedroom eyes?! Why did you ever sleep with me?
Monica  Do you really want to pull at that thread?
Phoebe  Im having a really good time!
Hums While He Pees  Me too! Im sorry that guy in the subway licked your
neck.
Phoebe  Ohh. No thats okay, hes a friend.
Hums While He Pees  Hey uh, I dont mean to be presumptuous but I have
these two tickets to the ballroom dancing finals tomorrow night if you want to go?
Phoebe  Yeah, I Well yknow I-I mean I missed the-the semi-finals, so
Id just be lost.
Hums While He Pees  I know its really lame, but I got these tickets from
my boss andOh no! No! No! My God!
Phoebe  Okay, dont freak out. Ill go.
Hums While He Pees  No its Uh, my ex-wife Whitney is out there. I
cannot deal with her right now. That woman is crazy!
Phoebe  Okay, I know. Hold on. (She walks over to the couch.) Hey Ross?
Ross  Yeah?
Phoebe  Yeah, umm thats Whitney (Points), Kyles ex-wife out there,
now do you think that you can yknow divert her so that we can slip out?
Ross  What?! No!
Phoebe  Well okay but I have two tickets to the ballroom dance finals. (She
holds up the tickets that Kyle gave her.)
Ross  Look, I dont think so Pheebs. (Pause) All right, Ill do it.
But just because youre a friend. (Grabs the tickets and heads to divert Whitney.)
[Scene  Ross's apartment, Ross is dancing around his living room as Phoebe enters,
catching and startling him.]
Phoebe  Hi Ginger.
Ross  All right! I want my key back!
Phoebe  I dont have it!
Ross  Its right there! (Points to her hand.)
Phoebe  Ugh, okay Sherlock! (Hands over the key.)
Ross  Look, Im sorry but you-you-you better go Pheebs.
Phoebe  All right, well I just wanted to say thank you though for diverting
Kyles ex.
Ross  Oh yeahNoYoure welcome. Well talk about it later.
Phoebe  Okay.
Ross  Hi Whitney.
Whitney  Hi Ross! You ready for breakfast?
Ross  Yep. (Phoebe slams the door shut.) Okay.
Phoebe  (To Ross) Kyles ex-wife? You were supposed to divert her not date
her!
Ross  (opens the door and to Whitney) Hi! Im sorry, but can you give me a
second while I talk to this woman, who by the way did not spend the night.
Whitney  Sure.
Ross  Okay. (Closes the door.) (To Phoebe) I did divert her and we ended
up having a great time! Okay?
Phoebe  Watching ballroom dancing?
Ross  Yes! Thats where we realized we were both super cool people!
Phoebe  Well look-look, okay Ross, Kyle just told me some really bad
stuff about her.
Ross  Like what?
Phoebe  Like shes really mean, and shes over critical,
and-andNo! She will paint a room a really bright color without even checking
with you!
Ross  Okay.
Phoebe  And! She uses sex as a weapon!
Ross  Fine! Thank you for warning me. At breakfast Ill be on full alert
for room painting and sex weapons.
Phoebe  Youre still gonna go out with her?!
Ross  Yeah!
Phoebe  Well, didnt you just hear what I said?!
Ross  Pheebs come on! I mean, consider the source! Of course her
ex-husbands gonna say that stuff. Now, if youll excuse me
Phoebe  (interrupting him) No listen to me! She is crazy!
Whitney  (outside the door) Uh, your door isnt sound proof.
Phoebe  You see? Nothing is good enough for her!
[Scene  Rachels Office, Tag is arriving as Rachel is standing there.]
Tag  Good morning.
Rachel  Hi Tag! Hey, so did you have fun with uh, with Joey last night?
Tag  Oh yeah! We went to the Knicks game.
Rachel  Ohh thats nice.
Tag  Then we went to this bar and he hooked us up with all these women!
Rachel  Wo-women? You mean like old women?
Tag  Well kinda old, like 30.
Rachel  (Pause) Oh.
Tag  And I never used to be able to just talk to girls in bars, but I got like
20 phone numbers last night.
Rachel  Thats great! Wow man, so Joey mustve really taught you some
stuff huh?
Tag  A little.
Rachel  Yeah?
Tag  (To her, in the Joey voice) How you doin?
[Scene  Joey and Rachel's, Joey is teaching Chandler how to smile. Chandler is
smiling.]
Joey  See? Thats a great smile! Easy. Natural. Now, pretend I have a
camera. (Chandler immediately does The Face.) Youre changing it!
Chandler  I cant help it!
Joey  All right, all right, all right, all right, you wanna know what I do when
I take resume shots?
Chandler  Borrow money from me?
Joey  Okay, firstfirst of all, you want to make it look spontaneous. I
look down (Looks down), look down, keep looking down; then I look up. (Looks up and
smiles.) See? All right, now you try. Look down (Chandler looks down), youre looking
down, keep looking down
Chandler  Why is there jelly on your shoe?
Joey  I had a donut. (Chandler nods.)
Rachel  (entering) Hi!
Joey  Hey!
Chandler  Hey!
Rachel  So uh, heard you had some fun with Tag last night.
Joey  Yeah! That guys all right!
Rachel  Yeah and you had fun teaching him how to be all Joey.
Joey  What?
Rachel  Yknow, all the women.
Joey  Hey well, you cant teach someone to be good with women. Yknow,
thats why I never had any luck with Chandler.
Chandler  (Pause) Im right here!
Rachel  All right, would-would you mind just not going out with him again? Okay,
just the idea of you and he and all these women, its justAnd I know hes
my assistant and I cant date himbut it just bothers me, all right?!
Joey  Hey! No-no-no-no, you cant take him away from me! I got a great
partner to pick up girls with! Finally!!
Chandler  Im still right here!
Rachel  All right, will you, will you at least tell him how hollow and
unsatisfying this, dating tons of women thing is!
Joey  (shocked) What?!
Rachel  I just dont want him to meet anybody until I am over my
crushAnd I will get over it. Its-its not like I love him, its just
physical! ButI mean I get crushes like this all the time! I mean hell, I had a crush
on you when I first met ya!
Joey  I know, Monica told me.
Chandler  Did you have a crush on me, when you first met me?
Rachel  Yeah. Sure. (Joey nods his head questioningly and Rachel nods no.)
Chandler  Can you people not see me?! (He waves his arms around to get their
attention.)
Rachel  (To Joey) So, will you talk to him?
Joey  I dont know Rach.
Rachel  Oh, come on! Ill give you ten free Ralph Lauren shirts.
Joey  One! (Pause.) No ten! You said ten! You cant take that back!
[Scene  Central Perk, Joey is there as Tag enters carrying a bag.]
Tag  Hey Joey, you wanted to talk to me?
Joey  I dont know. You uh, you got something for me?
Tag  Oh, yeah, this is from Rachel.
Joey  Ten. Okay. Now Tag theres such a thing as to many women.
Tag  Really?
Joey  Yeah, for you!
[Scene  The Portrait Studio, Monica is waiting for Chandler to make another attempt at
taking a good picture.]
Monica  (seeing him approach) Hey! There you are!
Chandler  There I am!
Monica  Are you okay?
Chandler  Yeah, Joey said I uh, I needed to relax so he gave me an
antihistamine.
Monica  What?!
Chandler  Yeah, and then I fell asleep on the subway and went all the way to
Brooklyn. Brooklyn is f-far!!
Monica  Chandler, what were you thinking?
Chandler  I dont know, but dont worry, dont worry, because I
know how to take a picture now. (They get ready) Okay, see? Look down (Looks down), look
down, look down (He falls asleep.)
Monica  Chandler?
Chandler  (awakens) Yeah! (Looks up and does The Face.)
[Scene  Central Perk, Ross and Phoebe are there.]
Phoebe  Hi.
Ross  Hi.
Phoebe  So, how are things going with crazy? Has she cooked your rabbit yet?
Ross  Listen, you are hearing one side of the story, okayand F.Y.I
she mustve shown Kyle over 30 paint samples before she painted that room! And his
response to each one was, "I dont give a tiny rats ass."
Phoebe  Yeah well, maybe she shouldve spent a little less time decorating
and a little more time in the bedroom.
Ross  Well, I dont think we are gonna have that problem, but maybe
thats just because I am not emotionally unavailable!
Phoebe  You think hes emotionally unavailable?
Ross  I think he can be.
Phoebe  Well, maybe he wouldnt be she didnt bring the office home
every night!
Ross  Well, excuse her for knowing what she wants to do with her life!
Phoebe  Yeah well, she certainly knew what she was doing New Years Eve
1997.
Ross  (angrily) I knew you were gonna throw that in my face!! That
was three years ago! She apologized and she apologized! What more do you want?!!
Phoebe  (gets up and starts to leave) We want the last six years back!!
Ross  So do we!! So do we!! (Ross notices a couple has been staring at them.)
Im sorry you had to see that.
[Scene  Rachels Office, Tag is entering.]
Tag  Good morning Rachel.
Rachel  Hi! (He hands her, her mail) Thanks, hey so uh whatd you do last
night?
Tag  Went out with Joey.
Rachel  Oh yeah? Another night of birdogging the chickas?
Tag  No. We had a really good talk. I dont think Im gonna do that
bar scene anymore.
Rachel  Wow! I did not see that coming.
Tag  Its just not really who I am. Y'know, Ive always been happier
whenWhy am I telling you this? You dont care about this stuff.
Rachel  Oh no, yes I do! I do! I mean, come on go on, you were, you were saying
I am happier when uh, yknow?
Tag  When Im in a relationship, I love having a girlfriend.
Rachel  Really?
Tag  Someone I can spoil, yknow?
Rachel  Sp-spoil?
Tag  Uh-huh! Let me ask you something?
Rachel  Uh-huh.
Tag  Do you believe that there is one perfect person for everyone?
Rachel  Well, I-Im startin too.
Tag  And if that person is already in your life, you should do something about
it right?
Rachel  Yes! Hell yes!
Tag  All right then, its settled.
Rachel  Okay.
Tag  Im gettin back together with my ex-girlfriend.
Rachel  Id love to!
Tag  What?
Rachel  (panics, turns around, picks up the phone, and pretend to talk on it)
Hello?! (Listens) Oh, yeah! (To Tag) This is gonna be a while. Excuse me. (Tag leaves and
she closes the door behind him, disgustedly.) Yeah!
[Scene  Central Perk, Ross and Phoebe are there again, only now theyre not
talking to each other. Phoebe is loudly stirring her coffee.]
Ross  My God!
Phoebe  Oh, Im sorry. Is that annoying? And speaking about being selfish
in bed, hows Whitney?
Ross  Well maybe she wouldnt have to be selfish in bed if someone else
knew where everything was!
Phoebe  Oh he knows! (Quietly) For the most part.
Kyle  Oh hey! Good, youre both here.
Whitney  We kinda need to talk.
Phoebe  Both of you together?
Ross  Wh-whats up?
Whitney  Well, I went over to Kyles last night to pick up a few things and
we got to reminiscing
Kyle  we talked through most of the night and we realized that the reason
we were so angry at each other was because there are still feelings there. So
(Pause)
Ross  Oh just say it Kyle!
Kyle  Were gonna give it another try.
Phoebe  What about her whining and her constant need for attention?!
Whitney  Im gonna work on that.
Phoebe  Oh right, because youre so capable of change.
Ross  (To Whitney) Yknow, he hums when he pees!
Whitney  I do know.
Ross  It makes him miss the bowl, but whatever.
Whitney  Were so sorry. (They get up to leave.)
Ross  Thats all right, we-we dont need you. In fact, hey Im
over it already.
Phoebe  Yeah, and yknow what? I dont give a tiny rats ass.
Kyle  Yeah, were gonna go. (They leave.)
Ross  (To Phoebe) Im sorry. Ugh, Pheebs, you were, you were right about
her. Yknow, she did try to use sex as a weapon! Yeah, I hurt my back a
little.
Phoebe  Oh. Yknow, he hums while he does other stuff to.
Ross  Yeah, were better off without them.
Phoebe  And yknow, even if they break up again, youd better not let
him in your sad mens club!
Ross  Divorced mens club.
Phoebe  Potato, Potaato. (Shes pronounces potato with the both the short
and long As.)
[Scene  Central Perk, Phoebe, Chandler, and Joey are there as Monica enters with the
local paper that has the engagement picture in it.]
Monica  Hey guys check it out! My mom sent me the paper!
Phoebe  Ooh, lets see it!
Chandler  Ahhh.
Monica  Okay. (She opens it up and shows it to them.)
Chandler  Oh yeah, that looks good.
Phoebe  You guys make a very attractive couple. (The camera cuts to a
shot of the picture and we see that Monica is posing with Joey instead of Chandler.)
Joey  Yeah, we look great together.
Monica  Yeah, we really do!
Chandler  Okay.
Monica  Wow! Imagine what our kids would look like!
Joey  Yknow, we dont have to imagine.
Chandler  Im marrying her.
Joey  Well just see.
[Scene  A Restaurant, Phoebe, Rachel, and Monica are having brunch.]
Monica  Okay, the reason why I asked you guys out to brunch today is because I
have been doing some thinking about who should be my maid of honor.
Rachel  Oh my God! This is it! (She and Phoebe hold hands.) (To Phoebe) I really
hope its you!
Phoebe  I hope its you.
Rachel  Me too!
Monica  First of all um, I love you both so much and youre both so
important to me
Rachel  Okay, bla-bla-bla-bla!! Who is it?!
Monica  Well umm, I was thinking that maybe we could come up with a system where
we trade of being maid of honor for each other. Like hypothetically, if Phoebe were
mine
Phoebe  Yes!!! Oh!!
Rachel  Hypothetically!
Phoebe  Still.
Monica  If Phoebe were my maid of honor
Rachel  Uh-hmm.
Monica  Rachel would be Phoebes, I would be Rachels, that way we all
get to do it once and no one would get upset.
Rachel  Yeah thats actually a pretty good idea.
Phoebe  Yeah, Ill do that. So who gets to be yours?
Monica  (laughs) Well thats the best part. Umm, you guys get to
decide!
Phoebe  Wh-why is that the best part?
Monica  Because then I dont have to!
Rachel  Well of course we will help you decide! We will do anything we
can to help you! Now, I would like to make a toast, to the future Mrs. Chandler Bing (A
woman at the table behind them overhears Chandlers name and starts listening
closer), my best friend, and truly one of the nicest people that
Monica  Im really not deciding!
Rachel  Fine!
Woman 
Monica  Yeah thats right.
Woman 
Phoebe  Aww, and good luck to you too! (To Monica and Rachel) What a nice lady!
[Scene  Ross's apartment, Chandler, Joey, and Ross are finishing watching Die Hard
on video.]
Chandler  Die Hard still great!
Joey  Yep. Hey, what do you say we make it a double feature?
Chandler  Whatd you rent?
Joey  Die Hard 2.
Chandler  (looking at the tape) Joey, this is Die Hard 1 again.
Joey  Oh, well we watch it a second time and its Die Hard 2!
Ross  Joey, we just saw it!
Joey  And?
Ross  And itll be cool to see it again! Yeah!
Joey and Ross 
Ross  Dude, you didnt say Die Hard. Is everything okay?
Chandler  Yeah, I just got uh, got plans.
Ross  Well, John McLane had plans!
Chandler  No, see the thing is I want to get out of here before Joey gets all
worked up and starts calling everybody bitch.
Joey  What are you talking about? Bitch.
[Scene  Central Perk, Phoebe is bringing Rachel some coffee.]
Phoebe  Hey Rachel?
Rachel  Yeah?
Phoebe  Umm, when I get married will you be my maid of honor?
Rachel  Really?!
Phoebe  Uh-hmm.
Rachel  Oh my God Phoebe! I mean Im justWait a minute. If Im
your maid of honor that means you are Monicas.
Phoebe  Oh! Well, if thats what you want
Rachel  Ohh! No way Phoebe! I want to be Monicas!
Phoebe  But why does it even matter?!
Rachel  Why does it matter so much to you?!
Phoebe  Because this one is now! And-and its two of our best
friends! Who knows what youre gonna marry!
Rachel  What-what if I marry RossOr Joey?
Phoebe  (gasps) You wouldnt! Okay look, Rachel I know you really want to
do this, but I-Ive never been maid of honor to anyone before! And I know youve
done it at least twice!
Rachel  Yeah but Phoebe
Phoebe  And no, oh please, oh please let me finish. (Rachel stops talking.) Oh I
guess that was it.
Rachel  Okay. Okay. Itssince youve never done it before you
can be Monicas made of honor.
Phoebe  Oh, thank you so much! (They hug.) Okay.
Rachel  Im gonna marry someone good yknow.
Phoebe  Oh I know.
Rachel  Better than Chandler. (Phoebe exhales as if to say, "Like what
isnt?")
[Scene  Ross's apartment, Die Hard has ended, only I dont think Joey and
Ross know that yet. As you see, they are both asleep. And theyre on the same couch.
Which means theyre sleeping together. Not like Joey is at one end and Ross is on the
other, they both happen to be lying down and sleeping together. Well, there hasnt
been any clothes removed so not that kind of sleeping together. Not that
theres anything wrong with that. That is unless youre a Republican in which
that kind of thing will bring about the downfall of Western society, especially if they
should happen to want to get married. Anyway, let me recap. No, there is too much, let me
sum up. Ross and Joey are taking a nap together on top of each other and both wake-up at
the same time, realize what they just did, scream, and jump up.]
Ross  What happened?!!
Joey  Well, I dont know!!
Ross  We fell asleep! That is all.
Joey  Yeah. Yep. Yeah. All right, well uh, Id better go.
Ross  I think that would be best.
Joey  Yeah. All right, Ill talk to you later.
Ross  Okay. But not about this!
Joey  No! Never! Never! (Pause, then Joey wants to shake Rosss hand.) Bye.
Ross  No touch! No touch!
[Scene  Monica, Chandler, and Phoebe's, Monica has just gotten back from brunch and is
telling Chandler about it.]
Monica  Yeah hey, a weird thing happened today whey I was at brunch. This woman
overheard that I was marrying you and-and then sheshe wished me good luck.
Chandler  Thats sweet.
Monica  No, its more like a (sarcastically) good luck.
Chandler  So uh, what did this woman look like?
Monica  She was like 30, dark hair, attractive.
Chandler  Well, is there any chance you were looking into a bright, shiny thing
called a mirror?
Monica  Come on, was it somebody maybe you dated in college?
Chandler  No, no I only dated two girls in college, both blonde, both not
attractive (Thinks a little while.) Hold on one second; let me check this out. (He
gets up and grabs a photo album.
Monica  What are you doing?
Chandler  Well, lets see (Finding the picture he wants.) Okay uh, is
that her? (Pointing to the picture.)
Monica  Oh my God yes! Who is she?
Chandler  Julie Grath, my camp girlfriend.
Monica  Did you break up with her?
Chandler  (pause) No, were still together. Yeah we went out for two
summers, and then I broke up with her.
Monica  Why?
Chandler  Well, cause she came back the third summer and shed gotten
really fa-aa-aw-ow
Monica  Fat?!
Chandler  I did not say fat! I said, "Fa-aa-aw-ow"
Monica  You broke up with a girl because she was fat?!
Chandler  Yeah. Yeah, but it was a really, really long time ago! Does she still
feel bad?
Monica  Well, apparently she does.
Chandler  Well, you know what they say, elephants never forget. (Monica is not
amused by that statement.) Seriously, good luck marrying me.
[Scene  Joey and Rachel's, Joey is entering, Rachel and Phoebe are already there.]
Joey  Hey! Whats going on?
Rachel  Phoebe is gonna be Monicas maid of honor!
Joey  Hey! Well I hope it goes better than the last time you did it for that
girl downstairs, remember? (Phoebe glares at him.)
Rachel  (shocked) You have been maid of honor before?!!
Phoebe  See? This is exactly why you shouldnt lie!
Rachel  All right thats it! I am maid of honor!
Phoebe  Na-uh, I am!
Rachel  How come you are?!
Phoebe  Because I cared enough to lie!
Joey  Hey-hey-hey-hey, I can help you decide who should do it! Yeah, we could
have like uh, like an audition and see how youd handle maid of honor type
situations.
Phoebe  What are you talking about?
Joey  Like when I want a job, I go to an audition and if Im the best of
the people they see, they give me the part.
Phoebe  Okay, so after this audition, who decides who gets it?
Joey  Oh uh, me and Ross can be the judges.
Phoebe  (To Rachel) Well, its better than us deciding.
Rachel  Oh, come on! This is crazy! Cant we just flip a coin?!
Phoebe  No! Coins hate me!
Rachel  Okay. Okay fine, yknow what? We will let Ross and Joey decide.
(Ross enters.) (In a sexy voice.) Hiiiii, Ross! Sweetie.
Phoebe  Hey there, you handsome thing. (Rachel and Phoebe exit.)
Ross  Wow, this cologne really is every bit as good as Georgio.
Joey  Hi.
Ross  Just uh, brought back your videos.
Joey  Uh hey look uh Ross, look I think we need to talk about before.
Ross  No! No we dont!
Joey  Yes we do! Now look, that was the best nap I ever had!!
Ross  I I dont know what you are talking about.
Joey  Come on! Admit it! That was the best nap you ever had!
Ross  Ive had better.
Joey  Okay! When?!
Ross  All right! All right! It was the best nap ever!
Joey  Uh-huh!
Ross  Ive said it! Okay?! But its over Joey!
Joey  I want to do it again.
Ross  We cant do it again.
Joey  Why not?
Ross  Because its weird!
Joey  Fine! Do you want something to drink?
Ross  Sure, what do you got?
Joey  Warm milk and Excedrin P.M. (Ross just leaves.)
[Scene  Monica, Chandler, and Phoebe's, Monica is approaching the bathroom door behind
which Chandler is using the facility.]
Monica  Chandler! (Knocks on the door.) Chandler! I just figured out who you
are!
Chandler  Can you figure out what Im doing?
Monica  Youre Lewis Posin.
Chandler  Who?
Monica  Lewis Posin! He was my best friend in fifth grade, and-and then one day
I asked him to be my boyfriend and he said no. Do you know why?
Chandler  Because you kept talking to him while he was trying to go to the
bathroom?!
Monica  No! But because he thought I was to faaaaa. (Chandler emerges,
without flushing by the way.) And every time I think about it, it makes me feel as bad as
I did in fifth grade! Yknow, I-I really think that you should apologize to Julie.
Chandler  What? Are you kidding? That was like 16 years ago.
Monica  No, I know. But yknow what? It would make me feel better if Lewis
apologized to me.
Chandler  Okay, I will do it. But I have to warn you; this may make me a better
person and that is not the man you feel in love with!
[Scene  Joey and Rachel's, Joey and Ross are laying out the ground rules for the maid
of honor auditions to Rachel and Phoebe.]
Joey  Okay, all right, this is how its going to work. Were gonna
give you hypothetical maid of honor situations and you will be scored on a scale of 1 to
10, 1 being the highest.
Ross  No, 10 is the highest.
Joey  Why is 10 the highest?
Joey  (crying) I dont want to marry Chandler!
Rachel  Okay, uh
Joey  Ive got cold feet.
Rachel  its gonna be okay!
Joey  No, one man for the rest of my life? I dont know if I can do it!
This means Ill never get to sleep with Joey!
Rachel  Look Monica, getting cold feet is very common. Yknow,
its-its just because of all the anticipation and you just have to remember
that you love Chandler. And also, I ran out on a wedding. You dont get to keep the
gifts.
Joey  (out of his Monica character) Very good! Drawing on your own experience, I
like that!
Rachel  Thanks!
Ross  Yes, very nice Rachel.
Rachel  Thank you judges.
Phoebe  Ugh, what a kiss ass.
Rachel  Oh!
Joey  Okay, Phoebe
Phoebe  Yes! Your honor?
Joey  Were now in the ceremony, Monica is about to say, "I do"
when her drunk uncle starts yelling. What do you do? Go!
Ross  (playing the drunk uncle) When Monica was a little girl, I remember
that(Phoebe screams and tackles him)Ooh!! Ow! Very good!
Phoebe  Oh!
Joey  Yes! Excellent! Perfect score!
Rachel  Wait a minute! She just made a scene in the middle of the ceremony!
Phoebe  Hey! Do you want do you want a little taste of Pheebs?!
Ross  It is time for you to give your maid of honor speech.
Rachel  Ohh, wait a minute, we havent pre
Ross  Go!
Rachel  Okay! Okay! Umm, Websters Dictionary defines marriage
as (Ross and Joey start writing.) Okay!! Forget that! That sucks!! Okay, never mind!
Forget it! Umm, umm, okay, uh I met, I-I met, I met Monica when we were just a
couple of six year olds and I became friends with Chandler when he was 25, although he
seemed like a six year old.
Ross and Joey 
Rachel  Thank you. Thank you very much. Umm, Ive known them separately and
Ive known them together and-and to know them as a couple is to know that you are
truly in the presence of love. So I would like to raise my glass (Grabs a glass and holds
it up) to Monica and Chandler and the beautiful adventure they are about to embark upon
together. I can think of no two people better prepared for the journey.
Joey  Wow. (To Ross) Good speech.
Ross  Yeah, it really was!
Rachel  Aw, thanks!
Ross  Okay Phoebe, I guess youre next (To Joey) although I really
dont see the point.
Joey  Yeah.
Phoebe  Okay, I cant believe that Monica and Chandler are getting married.
I remember talking about this day with Rachel while we were showering together, naked.
(Raises her glass and drinks.)
Joey  And shes back in the game.
[Scene  A random apartment building, Chandler and Monica are knocking on the door of
the woman from the beginning.]
Chandler  (she opens the door) Julie hi! Chandler Bing, I, I guess you remember
me.
Julie  Hello Skidmark.
Chandler  (To Monica) Its a nickname, Ill explain later.
Monica  Its pretty clear.
Chandler  Ah, uh, I owe you a long overdue apology. I never should have broken
up with you because you were overweight.
Julie  Thats why you broke up with me?
Chandler  You-you-you didnt know that. (Pause as she nods no.) Well, I
guess my work here is done!
[Scene  Central Perk, Joey and Ross are giving Phoebe and Rachel the results of their
election. Somewhat faster than Florida I might add.]
Joey  All right, well first of all I would like to say that you both performed
very well. Okay? You should be proud of yourselves. And-and I would also like to say that
in this competition there are no losers. Well, except for RachelDamnit!
Phoebe  Really?! I won!
Rachel  What?!
Ross  Im sorry Rach, it was, it was really close.
Rachel  Well then I demand a recount! (Hmm, I wonder where Ive heard that
before.)
Ross  Actually, it wasnt that close.
Rachel  No! Yknow what? No! No! You thing was so stupid anyway, this was
ridiculousWere gonna flip a coin! (Phoebe gasps.) All right?! (She flips the
coin.) Heads! (Looks at the coin and grunts in disgust.)
Phoebe  The coins have finally forgiven me!
Rachel  Well yknow what? I hope Monica forgives you after you throw her,
her vegetarian, voodoo, goddess circley shower! (Runs out.)
Phoebe  (running after her) Rach, its gonna be okay! (To Ross and Joey)
You guys are the best!
Joey  Boy I tell ya, that judging stuff took a lot out of me.
Ross  Yeah?
Joey  Yeah! I was thinking about maybe going upstairs and taking a little nap on
my couch. (Raises his eyebrows, questioning Ross to see if he wants to join him.)
Ross  Why-why would I care about that?
Joey  No reason, Im just saying that uh Thats where Ill
be.
[Scene  Monica, Chandler, and Phoebe's, Chandler and Monica have returned from
Julies.]
Chandler  As bad as that went I actually enjoyed myself. I think that Im
going to apologize for all of the stupid things I do.
Monica  Why dont you just stop doing stupid things? Then you wouldnt
have to apologize.
Chandler  I would really love it if could do both.
Monica  All right, II have to ask.
Chandler  What?
Monica  Are you gonna break up with me if I get fat again?
Chandler  What?!
Monica  Well, you broke up with Julie Grath! How much weight could she have
gained?
Chandler  A hundred and forty-five pounds.
Monica  In one year?! My God what did she eat? Her-her family! Thats not
the point.
Chandler  Look I know it was a stupid reason to break up with somebody, but I
was 15!
Monica  Well Thats not the only time this was an issue. You remember
when umm, you spent Thanksgiving with us? You called me fat.
Chandler  Okay. Okay, now wait a minute that was totally different.
Monica  How?
Chandler  You were not supposed to hear that! I said that behind you back!
Monica  What if I have babies, okay? I mean Im gonna look different.
Im okay with that, but Im not sure that you are!
Chandler  Look you have to realize I dont think of you as a thin,
beautiful woman. (Monica glares at him.) See this is one of things that I can apologize
for later! Look, what I mean is youre Monica! Okay? And I am in love with Monica.
Monica  Keep going.
Chandler  So you can balloon up or you can shrink down and I will still love
you.
Monica  Even if I shrink down to two inches tall?
Chandler  Id carry you around in my pocket.
Monica  I love you. (They hug and kiss.)
Chandler  Skidmarks still got a way with the ladies.
[Scene  Central Perk, Phoebe is there as Rachel enters carrying a shopping bag.]
Rachel  Hi Pheebs.
Phoebe  Hi!
Rachel  Hi! I just want to apologize. Im really sorry I was a baby.
Phoebe  Thats ridiculous Rachel, we were all babies once. (Rachel looks at
her.) Oh, you mean today.
Rachel  Yeah. Yeah, and yknow you-you deserve to win. And-and yknow
I was thinking about it, if-if youre Monicas maid of honor that means I get to
be yours.
Phoebe  Oh yeah!
Rachel  Yeah! Oh, umm when-when Monica and Chandler got engaged I started
putting some stuff together, yknow just in case
Phoebe  Oh thats so sweet thanks.
Rachel  Here is a book of poetry that I know Monica loves. And-and ohh God this
is funny, look, this is a picture of one Halloween where she dressed up as a bride. (Shows
Phoebe the picture.) And look, she made me carry her train, which was weird because I was Wonder
Woman. Oh and heres a little purse that I found. (Hands her the purse)
Yknow I just thought that maybe they could hold the rings in there.
Phoebe  Ohh.
Rachel  And umm, vintage handkerchiefs yknow cause, people cry at
weddings. (Starting to cry.) Im just gonna grab a couple of these.
Phoebe  This stuff is great!
Rachel  Oh, I forgot this was in here. Umm, this was the uh garter that I was
saving for my wedding and I wanted it to be Monicas something borrowed and its
blue. (Starts to cry again.) Yeah
Phoebe  Yknow Rach, I think that, I think you should be Monicas made
of honor.
Rachel  You do? Why?
Phoebe  Because I think it means more to you.
Rachel  But Pheebs, yknow you earned it.
Phoebe  Its fine. I mean, this is something that youve been thinking about
since you were what, 14? (Shes referring to the Halloween picture.)
Rachel  No, I was ten. I just developed early.
Phoebe  (looking at the picture again) Man alive!
Monica  (entering) Hey, whats going on?
Rachel  Hey!
Phoebe  Well, we just decided that Rachel is gonna be your maid of honor.
Rachel  Yeah okay, you laugh now, but shes gonna be yours. (Phoebe gets
suddenly scared.)
[Scene  Joey and Rachel's, Joey and Ross are napping together again and both wake up at
the same time.]
Joey  Great nap.
Ross  It really was.
Joey  (reacting first by jumping up) Dude! What the hell are you doing?! God!
(Heads for his room leaving Ross.)
Ross  (slowly stands up and says quietly) Excuse me. (Exits.)

[Scene  Joey and Rachel's, Joey is eating breakfast as Rachel enters having just woken
up.]
Joey  Morning!
Rachel  Hi! Oh, how was your date last night?
Joey  Pretty good.
Rachel  Oh good. (She walks to the closed bathroom door, opens it, and finds a
naked woman wrapped in a towel.) Ahhh! My God, sorry! (She closes the door and confronts
Joey.)
Joey  Okay, really good. Anyway I gotta go; Im late for work.
Rachel  What-what?! Youre gonna leave this person with me?!
Joey  YeahHey, dont worry, shes a terrific girl. And hey
listen, could you do me a favor? When she comes out could you just mention that Im
not looking for a serious relationship; thatd be great.
Rachel  Why?! What?! Are you kidding?!
Joey  Just casually slip it in, yknow lay the groundwork. Tell her uh,
Im a lonerNo! An outlaw! Tell her she doesnt want to get mixed up with
the likes of me.
Rachel  Yknow what? Thats a lot to remember, cant I just tell
her youre a pig?
Joey  Hey, Im gonna call her later! Honest! Oh come on, Chandler used to
do it! Hed even make the girl pancakes! Plus, hed make extras and leave
em for me.
Rachel  Well forget it, Im not telling that girl anything. That is not my
responsibility.
Joey  Fine! (Pause) Now, whered we land on those pancakes? (She chases him
out the door as his date emerges from the bathroom.)
Joeys Date 
Rachel  Hi.
Joeys Date 
Rachel  Yeah, Joey kinda disabled it when I moved in.
Joeys Date 
Rachel  Hi.
Erin  Hi. I dont mean this to sound like high school, but did he say
anything about me?
Rachel  (pause) Would you like some pancakes?
[Scene  N.Y.Us University Library, Ross is entering with Chandler.]
Chandler  Come on! Why are we here?!
Ross  Okay, okay take a guess.
Chandler  The hot chicks?
Ross  Okay, okay, I was typing names into the library computer earlier,
yknow-yknow for fun, and I typed mine in and guess what came up? My doctoral
dissertation! Its here! Yeah, its right-its right down here! In the
biggest library in the university! (They start heading that way, towards a secluded
section behind the racks.)
Chandler  Wow thats actually pretty cool.
Ross  (stopping quickly) Oh umm, theres also a book here by a woman named
Wendy Bagina. (They both laugh, but stop when the hear moaning coming from the next
aisle.) What is that?
Chandler  Sounds like two people are really enjoying the Dewey decimal system.
Female Student  (as they are moving past Ross) Im so sorry!
Male Student  Sorry!
Chandler  You didnt bring me here to do that, did you?
[Scene  Monicas Restaurant Kitchen, Monica is cooking as a waitress enters
carrying a plate of food that has been sent back.]
Monica  She sent the chicken back again?!
The Waitress  She says its to dry now and she wants to come back here and
explain to you exactly how she wants it.
Monica  Well fine! I want to meet this chicken expert! Send the Colonel in!
The Colonel 
Monica  (to the lobster) Lucky bastard! (Throws the lobster in and turns around
to face the planets most annoying woman, next to Dr. Laura and Kathy Lee Gifford of
course. Shes the most annoying female TV character however.) Janice.
Janice  How are you Ms. Hot Shot chef with the big fancy restaurant with the
best chicken ever! (Does the laugh.)
Monica  Im fine.
Janice  (notices Monicas engagement ring) Ohh! What is that on your
finger?! Im blind!
Monica  Oh Uh
Janice  So, whos the lucky guy?
Chandler  OHMYGAWD! I am so sorry sweetie, are you okay? You
didnt tell her we were getting married, did you?
Monica  Well, she saw the ring.
Chandler  Did she freak out?
Monica  Well, she was shocked when I told her, but then again so were most
people.
Chandler  Right.
Monica  Well, she actually has a boyfriend yknow herself, named Clark. Uh,
she also kinda invited herself to our wedding. Clark too.
Chandler  (laughs) You said no right?
Monica  Huh?
Chandler  You said no right?!
Monica  Well, she corned me! She asked if the wedding was in town! I mean, what
was I supposed to do?!
Chandler  Lie!!! How hard is that?! The checks in the mail! Oh your baby
is so cute! I cant wait to read your book Ross!!
Monica  Come on! So she comes to the wedding! I mean it wont be so bad.
Chandler  What do you think shes just gonna sit there quietly? You
dont think shes gonna want to make a toast? You dont think shes
gonna want to grab the microphone and sing Part-time Lover?!
Monica  Oh my God, shes not gonna like the chicken that night either is
she?!
Chandler  Yknow what? Its gonna be okay. Yknow what?
Shes probably not gonna even want to come.
Monica  Really?
Chandler  No! That was a lie! See how easy that was?
Monica  So-so you wouldve just lied?
Chandler  Yes!!
Monica  Would it really have been that easy?
Chandler  Yes!!!
Monica  Good, so do it Saturday night because were going to dinner with
her and Clark.
[Scene  Joey and Rachel's, Joey is coming back from work to find Phoebe, Rachel, and
someone else with her back turned is there.]
Joey  Hey! Whats up?
Phoebe and Rachel 
Joey  Hey-hey, whos your friend? (Erin turns around to face Joey,
startling him) Hey!!
Erin  Hey Joey!
Joey  Erin! Still here!
Rachel  Yeah, we ended up spending the day together and had such a great time!
Joey  Why wouldnt ya? Erin is great! Then-then theres you guys.
Erin  Ohh, listen. Ive got to get going. Today was great, thanks!
Rachel  I know!
Phoebe  Okay!
Erin  Bye Joey. (Kisses him.) Last night was fun.
Joey  Yeah. Ill uh, Ill call ya.
Rachel  Oh and Ill call ya too!
Erin  Or Ill call you!
Phoebe  And call me!
Joey  (to Erin) Okay, good to see you again.
Erin  Bye.
Joey  Bye-bye.
Rachel  Bye!
Joey  So, system kinda broke down huh?!
Rachel  Oh Joey, Im sorry I just couldnt tell her all those things
you wanted me to tell her. And yknow we got to talking and I
Phoebe  We want you to marry her!
Joey  What?!!
Phoebe  She is so amazing! You have no idea.
Joey  No idea? Who do you think brought her here?
Rachel  Cupid.
Phoebe  Joey, shes so cool. She speaks four languages.
Joey  Man, do you know what guys want!
Rachel  Look Joey, come on shes so perfect for you! I mean shes
sweet, she-she likes baseball, and she-she had two beers at lunch.
Joey  My beers?! Look you guys, shes a very nice girl. Okay? We had a good
time, but I justI dont see it going anywhere.
Phoebe  Yeah, but you always say that.
Rachel  Yeah, maybe if you gave this girl a chance it would go somewhere.
Joey  Look Im sorry you guys, I-I just dont think so.
Phoebe  Whatever.
Rachel  Fine. (They start to walk away.)
Joey  Hey, dont start judging me! (To Rachel) Huh? Youre the one
whos in love with her assistant! (To Phoebe) Huh? And you, youre the one
having the affair with the guy who keeps the pigeons on the roof!
Rachel  Phoebe!
Phoebe  Secret affair!
[Scene  Central Perk, Rachel and Joey are there as Ross enters.]
Ross  People are doing it in front of my book!
Rachel  Im sorry?
Ross  My doctoral dissertation is in the library at school, I went to see it,
and there were students makin babies right in the middle of the Paleontology
section!
Rachel  Oh my God! Did you get to see anything good?
Ross  Let me ask you something, at your school was there a like uh a place on
campus where students went to uh, fool around.
Rachel  Yeah, there was. It wasthere the corner of the library where-where
all these dusty books that nobody ever readYes, there was.
Ross  Great! Because people kept showing up, I think its like uh-a thing!
Joey  Now hold on a second, fifth floor against that back wall?
Ross  Oh for cryin out loud! (He storms out.)
Joey  All right, so we should go catch our movie.
Rachel  Well now whats the rush?
Joey  I like to see the previews. (Rachel looks at him.) The candy.
Phoebe  (entering with Erin) Oh. Hey!
Rachel  Well look whos here!
Erin  Hey!
Joey  Hey!
Erin  Joey.
Joey  Erin.
Erin  Hey Rachel.
Rachel  Hi! Well, we were just about to take off and see a movie. Oh no!
Erin  Whats wrong?
Rachel  Oh Phoebe, we forgot that party we have to go to.
Phoebe  Oh no.
Joey  (skeptical) What party?
Phoebe and Rachel 
Joey  Whos birthday party?
Phoebe and Rachel 
Joey  (still skeptical) Oh, and how is Allison?
Phoebe and Rachel 
Rachel  (does a retching sound) Wait a minute! Why dont you guys do
something?!
Joey  (still skeptical) Yeah, look how that worked out.
[Scene  The Library, Ross enters and heads to the desk to talk to the male librarian on
duty.]
Ross  Excuse me. Hi, Im a professor here. Do you know the Paleontology
section, fifth floor, stack 437?
The Librarian  Well, yes! Just give me five minutes, I just have to find someone
to cover my shift.
Ross  No! No!! No! Can I speak to someone in charge please?! (The librarian
brings his boss over.)
The Head Librarian  How can I help you?
Ross  Hi, I was wondering if it is possible to increase security in the
Paleontology section? See I-I wrote a book up there and instead of reading it people
are-are-are well, rolling around in front of it.
The Head Librarian  We are aware of the problem you are referring too. (He turns
to look at the previous librarian.) But as far as increasing security, Im afraid the
library is very understaffed. I, I cant help you.
Ross  Well, fine. Fine! If-if Im the only person with any appreciation of
the sanctity of the written word, Ill go up there and defend it myself! (Starts to
do so, but stops and to the previous librarian) And dont you follow me!
[Scene  Joey and Rachel's, Rachel and Phoebe are doing dishes as Joey enters.]
Joey  Hey.
Phoebe  Hey!
Rachel  How did it go with Erin?
Joey  Oh, unbelievable! We had the best time!
Phoebe  Yay!! Oh so, youre not, youre not mad at us anymore?
Joey  No! No! No! You guys were totally right! This is so much better than the
first time we went out. Yknow? That was so awkward, we were really nervous.
Phoebe  Didnt you sleep together?
Joey  Yeah that really calms me down. And! We have so much in common! She loves
sandwiches, sports, although she is a Met fan, not much of an issue now but if were ever
to have kids, well thats a
Rachel  (gasps) Oh my God! Listen to you talkin about having kids. Oh my
Joey. (She goes over and hugs him.) Oh, please dont get married before I do.
Joey  Okay.
[Scene  A Restaurant, Monica and Chandler are on their date with Janice and Clark,
however Clark is a no show and Janice is crying the Mississippi River about it.]
Janice  Oh. Oh I just cannot believe Clark stood me up!
Monica  He might still show up.
Janice  Oh, what are you, stupid? Its been three hours.
Monica  Is that all?
Janice  I should just go on to happier things, okay? Umm, why dont you
tell about your lovely wedding?
Chandler  Well actually uh, there was something we wanted to tell you about the
wedding. Um, its going to be a small ceremony. Uh, tiny! Were not even sure
why were having it.
Monica  Its actually going to be just family.
Janice  Ohwaityou two think of me as family?! Oh, I have to ask you
something now and be honest; do you want me to sing Careless Whisper or Lady In
Red?
[Scene  Central Perk, Joey is entering and arguing baseball with Erin. Phoebe and
Rachel are already there.]
Joey  How can you say that?! The Mets have no closer!
Erin  What about Benitez?
Joey  What about Game 1 of the Series?
Erin  What about shut up?
Joey  You shut up! (To Phoebe and Rachel) I love arguing with her. (To Erin)
Ill be right back.
Erin  Okay. (Joey goes to get some coffee and Erin sits down.)
Rachel  So hows it goin with Joey?
Erin  Uh, okay.
Rachel  Okay? Wait okay, tell-tell me that you like him, please? I mean tell me
that you like him.
Erin  Look, hes a really great guy and I know that you really want
this to work out, but I just dont see this having a future.
Rachel  But you said that you liked him! I mean what happened?! Did ya just
change your mind?!
Erin  Kinda.
Phoebe  Then change it back!
Erin  Im sorry I Its just theres no real spark.
Phoebe  No spark? Didnt you sleep together?
Erin  Yeah.
Rachel  Ugh, tramp!
Phoebe  Does Joey have any idea?
Erin  I really dont think he does. And yknow what? Maybe you guys
could help clue him in. Yknow, tell him Im-Im not interested in a
serious relationship or something.
Phoebe  Yeah, you mean like that youre kind of a loner.
Erin  Yeah! That would be great!
Phoebe  Yeah, and maybe that youre a real (She says something in Italian,
and it doesnt matter what she said. Its not important so I dont need
everyone who speaks Italian telling me what she said.)
Erin  Im sorry?
Phoebe  Oh well, I guess Italian isnt one of the four languages you speak.
Joey  (returning) Hey! You wanna go?
Erin  Yeah, lets go.
Joey  Okay. See you guys later.
Erin  Bye guys.
Rachel  Yeah, see ya.
Joey  (whispers to Phoebe and Rachel) Hey, thank you so much. (They both exit.)
Rachel  Wow. Well, I guess it was Cupid who brought her here.
Phoebe  No, just a regular old flying dwarf.
[Scene  The librarys Paleontology section, Ross is patrolling as a couple walks
up.]
Ross  Yes? Yes?! How can I help you?
Guy  Yeah, we werewe were just looking around.
Ross  Oh-oh, youre-youre fellow scholars. What exactly were you
looking for, hmm? Perhaps, (Grabs a book from the shelf behind him) perhaps Dr. Chester
Stocks musings on the Smiledon Californicus?
Guy  Uhh.
Ross  Ah AhGet out of here! (The couple retreats. Ross starts
looking through the previously mentioned book as a beautiful woman walks into the
section.) Uh, meeting someone? Or-or are you just here to brush up on Marions views
on evolution?
Woman  Uh, actually I find Marions views far to progressionist.
Ross  I find Marions views far to progressionist.
Woman  Im sorry, who are you?
Ross  Im a professor here uh, RossGeller.
Woman  Ross Geller, why do I know that name? Its uhWait! (Grabs his
book off of the shelf.) Did you write this?
Ross  Yes! Youre the person who checked out my book?!
Woman  Yknow, you look nothing like I wouldve thought.
Youreyoure so young.
Ross  Well I uh, I skipped forth grade.
Ross  I am veryvery sorry.
[Scene  Joey and Rachel's, Phoebe and Rachel are watching TV as Joey enters.]
Joey  Hey!
Phoebe  Hey!
Rachel  Hi!
Phoebe  So how was, how was your date?
Joey  Oh, it was great! I mean we walked all around the village. We went to this
ice cream place, split a milkshake, 70/30 but still And guess what, Im
thinking about taking her upstate to one of those bed and breakfasts.
Phoebe  Oh really? She said she wants to go away with you?
Joey  No-no-no-no-no! Its a surprise, but its gonna be tricky
thought because she said she was gonna be pretty busy at work for a while.
Phoebe and Rachel 
Rachel  Jo-Joey, look honey we-we need to talk okay? Umm, I kinda got the
feeling from her today that uh, shes not lookin for a serious relationship.
Joey  Where are you gettin this?
Rachel  Well, she told me. She said shes kinda a loner.
Joey  Oh. Oh.
Rachel  Joey
Joey  No hey Rach, its cool okay? Yknow Im a loner too! (Heads
for his room.) Right?
Phoebe  Hey Joey, yknow what? You are way to good for her.
Rachel  Yeah and honey I promise next time that I will just say good-bye and
tell em youre not looking for a relationship.
Joey  No! No. Dont do that, just next time make sure she really likes me.
Rachel  Well that too. (Joey goes into his room.) Joey?
Joey  Yeah?
Rachel  Do you want some pancakes?
Joey  (coming back out) Finally!
[Scene  Monica, Chandler, and Phoebe's, Chandler and Monica are sitting at the kitchen
table and are still trying to decide what to do about Janice.]
Monica  What are we gonna do?
Chandler  I say we go with Careless Whisper.
Janice  Chandler?
Chandler  (To Monica) Did she see us yet? Did she see us?
Monica  Janice, what umm, what are you doing here?
Janice  Well umm, I thought I was going to go back to my apartment but then I
just felt I couldnt really be alone tonight. (Joey walks into view of the open door
behind Janice, sees her, gets a terrified look on his face, and flees in horror.) I was
wondering if I could maybe stay here with you, just I really feel that I need to be with
family.
Monica  (To Chandler) Our kids are gonna call her Aunt Janice arent they?
Janice  Please, its because otherwise I really dont know what I
might do.
Chandler  Arent you just a tinsy bit curious?
Janice  (starting to cry) Do you have any tissues?
Monica  Yeah, in-in-in the bathroom.
Janice  Okay! (She runs for the bathroom)
Monica  Well justwell just let her stay.
Chandler  No-no-no-no, if we let her stay, she will stay forever!
Monica  Kinda like your Barca lounger.
Chandler  Is that what youre thinking about right now?
Monica  I never stop thinking about it.
Janice  Hey you guys, umm do either one of you want to get in there before I
take my bath.
Chandler  Janice, Im sorry but umm, you cant stay here tonight.
Janice  Why not?
Chandler  Honestly? Our apartment is a hotbed for electromagnetic activity. Now
Monica and I have been immunized, but sadly you have not.
Janice  Okay, Im going to need a comforter, but did you have a
hypoallergenic one because otherwise I get very nasal. (Makes some weird sound) Do you
have a cat? Cause its already happening. (Makes a nasal sound) Do you hear
that? (She keeps making the nasal sound.)
Monica  Oh my God! Oh my God! You have to go!
Janice  Why?
Monica  Because Chandler still has feelings for you!
Janice  He does?
Chandler  Say again?
Monica  Thats right. Thats right. And that is why you cant
stay here tonight. And probably why you shouldnt come to the wedding.
Chandler  Feelings, such strong feelings.
Monica  I mean, I realize that his feelings may never completely go away, but you
can.
Janice  Ohmy Gawd, I-I understand. I-I am so sorry, Ill go. (Starts
for the door.) Good-bye Monica (hugs her), I wish you a lifetime of happiness with him.
Chandler, (hugs him) you call me when this goes in the pooper. (Hurries out.)
[Scene  The librarys Paleontology section, Ross is on patrol and stops a security
guard through the stack of books.]
Ross  (to the guard) Dont sweat it, Ive got this section covered.
Yeah, in fact Ive got this little baby (Turns on a mini-flashlight) to shine in
peoples eye(The guard walks away)Okay, see you later.
Chandler  I just wanted to show Monica your book. (Ross just glares at him.)

Phoebe are sitting around the table writing one notepads while Chandler is looking over
their shoulders.]
Ross  (entering) Hey everybody! Happy Thanksgiving!
Chandler  No, no, no. No-no-no.
Joey, Rachel, and Phoebe 
Ross  What, are we keeping Thanksgiving a secret this year?
Chandler  No, we're playing this game I learned at work. You have to name all
the states in six minutes.
Ross  What? That's like insanely easy!
Chandler  Now, that's a lot harder than it sounds. You always forget at least
one, or in some cases... fourteen (looks over to Monica).
Monica  It's a stupid game and I wasn't playing against other people, so
technically I didn't lose.
Ross  What? You forgot fourteen states?
Monica  Nobody cares about the Dakotas. (Thats true in so many ways, trust
me, Ive lived in one and been to the other.)
Chandler  Oh, okay, time's up!
Rachel  All right, I got 48.
Chandler  Oh that's not bad, Pheebs?
Chandler  Okay, so Rachel's got 48 and Phoebe has the lead invegetables,
Joey?
Joey  Say hello to the new champ of Chandler's dumb states game.
Ross  Wow, how many have you got?
Joey  Fifty-six!
[Scene  Monica, Chandler, and Phoebe's. Ross is sitting in the couch doing Chandler's
game. Chandler is sitting in his barca-lounger. The girls are in the kitchen.]
Joey  Hey! How is New England not a state? Huh? They have a sports-team!
Chandler  Does South Oregon have a sports-team? (Joey strikes one from his list)
There you go.
Rachel  (counting the place settings) How come we have one extra place setting?
Monica  'Cause you invited your assistant.
Rachel  Oh, right. Sorry. But Tag's not coming; his girlfriend came into town,
so he's spending Thanksgiving with her.
Monica  Oh! Why didn't you tell me? I made him his own individual sweet potato
stuffed pumpkin.
Rachel  Well, I was going to, but then I figured, you know... you're food is so
delicious and perfect, you can never have too many of those pumpkin things.
Monica  Now you think I wouldn't enjoy that, because it is so fake, (Laughs) but
I still do.
Phoebe  Regular Celery! (Starts to write that on her list) Oh, I already have
that. (She gets up and heads for her room)
Ross  Done! With time a-to-spare.
Chandler  Oooh that may be a New World's record (Looks at his watch and picks up
Ross' pad)
Ross  You know, I hate to lecture you guys, but it's kinda disgraceful, that a
group of well-educated adults and Joey can't name all the states. Did you ever see a map,
or one of those round, colorful things called "a globe?" Hmm?
Chandler  Uh, Magellan? You got 46 states. (Smiles and hands Ross back his pad)
Ross  What? That's impossible.
Joey  46. Wow! Who's well educated now, Mr. I-forgot-ten-states?
Monica  All right, I'm out of oven space. I'm gonna turn on Joey's. Please,
watch him! Do not let Joey eat any of the food!
Chandler  I am only one man! (Monica heads out) Okay Ross, time is up!
Ross  No, just give me another minute.
Chandler  Look Ross, if you don't know them by now, you will never know them,
okay? That is the beauty of this game. It makes you want to kill yourself.
Ross  This-this is crazy! I can do this! All right, uhh, I bet I can get all 50
before dinner.
Chandler  Okay, but if you can'tno dinner!
Ross  You're on!
Joey  (gets up) All right. Don't look at my list, Ross, 'cause there's a lot on
there that you don't have.
Monica  (entering, to Joey and Rachel) Hey, did you guys know, that your oven
doesn't work?
Joey  But the drawer full of take-out menus is okay, right?
Monica  Ross, I'm gonna use yours, okay?
Ross  Pshhshhh!
Monica  Chandler? Can you give me a hand? (Grabs her jacket)
Chandler  Sure, and Joey; do not let Ross look at any of the maps or the globe
in your apartment.
Joey  Don't worry, Chandler, it's not a globe of the United States.
Phoebe  Hey you guys I'm gonna go out and take a walk.
Ross  Phoebe, why is your bag moving?
Phoebe  Oh, it's not!
Rachel  Seriously, it's moving!
Joey  What the hell is in there?
Phoebe  It's just my knitting that's all! (A dog sticks its head out of Phoebe's
bag. Everyone looks puzzled.) Yes! I knit this. I'm very good.
[Scene  Ross' apartment, Monica and Chandler enter.]
Monica  Rosss apartment is nice! How come we don't hang out here more
often?
Chandler  I don't know. Maybe it's because it smells a little weird. It's like
old pumpkins or something.
Monica  That's my pie!
Chandler  Which smells delicious!
Monica  Uh-oh! Uh-oh!
Chandler  What?
Monica  We left Joey alone with the food! (Walks towards the window and looks
out) Yep! Yep, I knew it! There he is... feeding stuffing to a dog!
[Scene  Monica, Chandler, and Phoebe's, Ross is still doing his list. Rachel and Joey
are feeding the dog as the phone rings.]
Phoebe  (answering the phone) Hi Geller-Bing residence. How can I help?
Monica  Phoebe, why is there a dog in our apartment?
Phoebe  I'm sorry, who's this?
Monica  Phoebe, there's a dog sitting on my couch!
Chandler  Tell her, I'm allergic, and I will sue!
Phoebe  No, there's no dog here?
Monica  Yes there is! He's black and white and shaggy and [Cut to Monicas
apartment] he's sitting next to Rachel and licking Rachel's hand.
Phoebe  Oh my god! Where are you? (Looks around.)
Monica  I'll be right there!
Phoebe  (Phoebe hangs up and someone knocks on the door. She gasps.) They're
here already? How are they doing this?
Rachel  (gets up and opens the door) Hi Tag! What are you doing here?
Tag  I, uh, wanted to see if your offer to spend Thanksgiving with you is still
good.
Rachel  Well, sure! Come in! (He enters) Well, what-what happened to your
girlfriend?
Tag  We kinda broke up this morning.
Rachel  Oh, I'm sorry.
Tag  Yeah, so she went back to Ohio.
Ross  Ohio!! Thank you!
Chandler  Huh! Where is the dog?!
Ross  What dog? There-there's no dog here.
Joey  Yeah that dog left!
Monica  (walks to Phoebe's door) Phoebe! Phoebe, open up!
Phoebe  There's no dog in here.
Chandler  Phoebe, we can hear the dog barking!
Phoebe  No that's just me coughing! (Doing some weird coughing noises and the
dog barks again. Phoebe comes out of the room.) Oh, good, there you are! Listen, um, I
have a dog in my room.
Chandler  What is it doing here?
Phoebe  Well, I'm watching it for some friends who went out of town. Wait. (She
bends down, picks up the dog, and waves with one of its paws) Hello, my name is Clunkers.
May I please stay with you nice people?
Monica  Oooh, I wish she could stay here, but Chandler is allergic!
Chandler  Extremely allergic, okay? If I'm anywhere near a dog for more than 5
minutes, my throat will just close up!
Phoebe  That's odd, 'cause this dog's been living here for the past 3 days
Chandler  (gasping) Really?
Monica  Chandler, if that dog's been here that long, and you haven't had a
reaction, maybe you're not allergic to this dog?
Chandler  Well, it still has to go, right?
Monica and Phoebe 
Chandler  Okay, it's um
Joey  (interrupting him) Don't do it!
Monica  Don't do what?
Chandler  (to Joey) I have to! Okay? It's time! (Joey shrugs as if to say,
"Do what you have to do") Okay, I hate dogs.
All  What?
Phoebe  Are you crazy?
Ross  Are you out of your mind?
Phoebe  Why?
Joey  Told ya. (Waves bye-bye.)
Chandler  They are needy, they are jumpy, and you can't tell what they are
thinking, and that scares me a little bit.
Ross  Right, they are scary. (He jumps up, screaming) Ahh, she just ate a treat
out of my hand!!!
Rachel  Wait a minute. Do you not like all dogs? I mean, not even puppies?
Chandler  (scared) Is there a puppy here?
Tag  You don't like puppies?
Chandler  (to Tag) Okay, you are new!
Joey  Look, Chandler, I told you, never tell anyone about this dog thing. It's
like Ross not likin ice cream.
Phoebe  You don't like ice cream?
Ross  It's too cold.
Chandler  Okay, it's just that dogs make me a little uncomfortable.
Ross  (to Phoebe) It hurts my teeth.
Chandler  And I don't wanna say this, I don't you guys to hate me, but uh, I
don't think, I can be around that dog anymore. Okay, so either the dog goes, or I go. (An
awkward silence ensues.) Oh my god!!
Ross  How can I not get this? I'm a college professor; I got 1450 on my S.A.T.s.
Monica  1250.
Ross  Damn, I forgot you were here.
Phoebe  All right. We're gonna take Clunkers to Rosss. We'll be back in a
minute. (Gets up with Monica to do so.)
Rachel  Oh, wait before you guys go, can I just ask you a question?
Monica  Yeah.
Rachel  When a guy breaks up with his girlfriend, what is an appropriate amount
of time to wait before you make a move?
Phoebe  Oh, I'd say about a month.
Monica  Really? I'd say 3 to 4.
Joey  Half hour. (Rachel turns to look at him and he nods yes.)
Rachel  Interesting.
Monica  When it's your assistant, I would say never.
Joey  All right, Rach, the big question is, does he like you? All right? Because
if he doesn't like you, this is all a moo-point.
Rachel  Huh. A moo-point?
Joey  Yeah, it's like a cow's opinion. It just doesn't matter. It's moo.
Rachel  (to Monica and Phoebe) Have I been living with him for too long, or did
that all just make sense?
Monica  Please, don't listen to Joey, okay. Would you look at him? He-hes
obviously depressed. He's away from his family; he's spending Thanksgiving with strangers.
  What he needs right now is for you to be his friend.
Rachel  You're right, I'm sorry. Thank you. Okay, that's what I'm gonna do.
Joey  Fine! Take their advice. No one ever listens to me. When the package is
this pretty, no one cares what's inside.
Rachel  Hey!
Tag  Hey.
Rachel  How are you holding up?
Tag  Not bad.
Rachel  Yeah? I'm sorry about your girlfriend.
Tag  Thanks.
Rachel  So were you guys together a long time?
Tag  A year. On and off. I kinda thought we'd end up together. I don't anymore.
Rachel  Now that she broke up with you?
Tag  Yeah.
Rachel  Yeah. Hmmmm.
Tag  It's weird. I always used to assume, that I would meet someone and fall in
love and be happy and all that was just a given. But lately it's like what if it's not. Do
you ever have that feeling?
Rachel  NoYeah, all the time, constantly. It's terrifying. But you know
that I figure itit has to work out.
Tag  Why?
Rachel  Because, uhit has to.
Tag  You have all the answers, don't you?
Rachel  Yeah, I know, I do. I really do.
Tag  Hey, thanks for talking to me.
Rachel  Well, what is a boss for? Hug it out! (They hug)
Joey  (through the window) All right, he likes you back! Huh? Told ya, you
should go for it!
Tag  What?
Joey  (realizes what he said) Street noise drowned any of that out? (Rachel
moves madly towards him) No, all right, I see you later, okay... (Turns away embarrassed)
[Scene  The Balcony, continued from earlier.]
Tag  What did Joey say? I like you back?
Rachel  Uh, yeah, well, see, he Joey knows, that I'm-I'm very insecure
about my back and, andyou're hugging me, so obviously you are not repulsed by it,
yeah!
Tag  Wait-wait a minute; that doesn't make any sense.
Rachel  No? (He shakes his head) All right, here's the truth um, Joey said what
he said, because um, I'm attracted to you.
Tag  Wow. (He starts to walk towards the railing.)
Rachel  Yeah, I admit it. I have a crush on you, and uh, and, and I know that's
crazy because we work together, and-and nothing could ever happen, and the last thing I
want to do is-is to freak you out or make you feel uncomfortable. Which is why it would be
really great if you said something right about now.
Tag  (looking at the street) Oh my god! Those guys are stealing my car! (He
points down to the street)
Rachel  What?
Tag  Right there! That's my car! (Sound of a breaking car-window) Hey!!
Rachel  Okay, that's gonna take them a minute. Do you have anything else you
wanna get off your chest?
Tag  I can't believe this! (He walks back in again)
Rachel  (she hurries after him) Wait, we still have time to talk and
theyre-they're not even in the car yet! (She takes a quick look down the street.) Oh
look, there they go, okay. (She hurries in, too)
[Scene  Ross' apartment, Monica and Phoebe sitting on the floor next to Clunkers
basket.]
Monica  Okay Phoebe, we should probably go back now.
Phoebe  (doing Clunkers) Please don't leave me, I'll be lonely.
Monica  Stop it. Stop! Okay let's go. We can be strong.
Phoebe  Yeah, okay.
Monica  Oh my god! Did you hear that? She said Monica! (She goes back to
Clunkers again) Oooh, I can't leave her!
Phoebe  You know if you want, we can sneak the dog back in and Chandler wouldn't
even know.
Monica  That's not gonna work.
Phoebe  I've had that dog there for three days and Chandler had no idea. He's
not so smart.
Monica  Hey! I didn't know either.
Phoebe  Yeah, but you kinda knew that something was going on, didn't you?
Monica  Yeah, I knew.
[Scene  Monica, Chandler, and Phoebe's. Ross lays a lot off small papers, shaped like
the U.S. states onto the floor making a map with the states. Phoebe enters]
Phoebe  Where's Chandler?
Chandler  (comes out of the bathroom) Here I am.
Phoebe  Wash your hands!!!
Chandler  How did youknow? (Heads back into the bathroom)
Ross  Hey! What's she doing back here?
Monica  Relax, Ross. She's not made of ice cream!
Ross  Hey look, Phoebe. I, uh, I laid out the states geographically...
Phoebe  (interrupts him) No, no, we don't really have time for this right now.
Okay, we have to keep Chandler away from my bedroom.
Ross  Yeah, but, but look what I'm...
Phoebe  See, this is exactly what we do not have time for. (She rushes into her
room)
Chandler  (comes out of the bathroom) Where's Monica?
Ross  Um, in Phoebe's room. You can't go in there.
Chandler  Why not?
Ross  Monica's crying. She's very upset about this whole Clunkers thing.
Chandler  Well, I, I should go in there.
Ross  No. No, no. She doesn't want to see you right now.
Chandler  Why not?
Ross  Because you sent away the dog!
Chandler  This is ridiculous. (He heads for Phoebe's bedroom)
Ross  Oh, is it? Is it? Look, when Monica and I were kids, we had a dog
named Rover. And, uh, one day, my dad decides, he doesn't like dogs. So Monica and her
friendPhyllistake away the dog. And that was the last time we ever saw him.
Don't you see? This is just like that. Only with a few details changed.
Joey  (entering) Okay, I'm in my sweat pants. Bring on the food! (Sees that
Chandler has a worried look on his face) What's the matter?
Chandler  Monica's all upset, because I sent Clunkers away.
Joey  So? Bring the dog back, you're a hero.
Chandler  Yeah, I can be a hero, I could do that. I could, I could do... I,
w-w-what if, what if it attacks me?
Joey  Chandler, it's like a big gerbil.
Chandler  And that doesn't scare you? (He walks out)
Joey  Ross, you need some help?
Ross  From you? (He does a weird desperate laughter, like he's almost crying)
Yes, please!
Joey  (sits down next to Ross) First of all, Utah? Dude, you can't just make
stuff up!
Ross  I hate America! When I finish this game, I swear I am moving.
Joey  Hey! Tag's still talking to the police.
Rachel  Yeah, ohh! Why, damnit, why did I open my mouth? (In a girlish voice) I
have a crush on you; I am attracted to you. (Back to normal again) Gee, I-I know that I
freaked him out
Joey  If you said it like that, you probably did, yeah.
Phoebe  (opens her bedroom door and peeks out) Hey, is Chandler here?
Chandler  No, no he went for a walk.
Phoebe  Okay, but you cannot tell him... but look whose back!
Rachel  (gasps) Hi!
Joey  Oh No-no-no-no-no-no-no! He went over to Ross' to bring the dog back here!
Phoebe  Oh no, the dog's not going to be there!
Joey  You think?
Monica  Hi, honey.
Chandler  Please, please, please, don't be mad at me.
Monica  What? Why, why would...
Phoebe  (interrupts her, to Monica) Shh, wait and see. Maybe we will, maybe we
won't.
Chandler  Okay, I went over to Ross' apartment to bring back Clunkers.
Yknow, for you, and(Clears his throat) I left the door open and she must have
gotten out and I looked everywhere, all over the apartment, including the roof,
which FYI Ross, one of your neighbors, growing weed. I couldn't find him, and I am so, so,
so, sorry. But I do know where we could all go ease the pain. (Points up and then
over to the street)
Phoebe  We have good news, look whose back!
Rachel  (uncovers the dog) Hi!
Chandler  Clunkers?! Oh my god!
Monica  That's right, she came back all by herself.
Phoebe  It's a Thanksgiving miracle!
Chandler  (to Clunkers) It is so good to see you!
Phoebe  Yeah, she came all the way back from Ross' building. Oh, the things she
must have seen! And then she climbed up the fire escape and she tapped on the window with
her teeny little paw and then we ran to let her in(Realizes, that Chandler starts to
not believing her) I went to far, didn't I? When should I have stopped?
Ross  Okay, maybe this is so hard, because there aren't 50 states. Let me tell
you something, I have 49 states, and there are no more! I-I think, I should be able
to eat something.
Chandler  It's up to you.
Rachel  Oh, hi! How are you doing?
Tag  I'm okay. I gotta go down to the police station and look at mug shots.
Rachel  Oh.
Tag  Thanks for having me over, you guys.
Ross  Tag? Y-You're going? (Comes over to Tag) Uh we didn't, uh we didn't get
the chance to talk. Uh, so, where did you say you're from again?
Tag  Colorado.
Ross  Ah, what good are you. (Walks back to his map dejectedly.)
Rachel  Look, um, I think we should talk about what happened on the terrace.
Tag  Okay.
Rachel  Ah, I-I never should have said what I said. Ityknow what? It
just doesn't matter how I feel. I mean we work together, so nothing could really ever
happen between us, and what I would love is just to go to work on Monday, and-and never
talk about this again, okay? Big day Monday lots to do. So, we're okay?
Tag  Um, I'm not.
Rachel  Oh, god, I know it, that I freaked you out.
Tag  No, you didn't. The only thing that freaked me out was you saying that
nothing could ever happen between us.
Rachel  Really?
Tag  Yeah, so, please don't fire me for doing this. (He kisses her)
Rachel  Okay, well, that's one less thing we have to do on Monday.
[Scene  Monica, Chandler, and Phoebe's, later that night, there is someone knocking on
the door and Chandler stumbles out into the living room, turns on the light, looks through
the peephole, and opens the door.]
Ross  Delaware! (Starting to cry.) Delaware!
Chandler  All right.
Ross  (hands Chandler his pad and walks in) I want my turkey now!
Chandler  You got it. (Starts looking at the pad, while Ross got the turkey out
of the fridge and starts to unwrap and it) You got Nevada twice.
Ross  (pauses) I know.
Chandler  Yeah. (Throws the pad on the table and heads for the bedroom)

[Scene  Central Park, Ross is teaching Ben how to ride a bike. Chandler, Monica, and
Phoebe are they also.]
Ben  (on the bike) Im ready!
Ross  You sure?
Ben  Uh-huh!
Chandler  Okay, let me just straighten out your helmet there. (Does so.)
Ben  (To Chandler) Thanks daddy.
Ross  No-no, one daddy, two mommies. All right, its all yours.
(Ross pushes him off.)
Chandler  Okay. Okay.
Ross  Yes! Yes! Yes!! (Everyone stands and claps.)
Phoebe  His first big kids bike, this is so exciting!
Monica  Oh yeah, I remember mine! Ohh, it was my sixth birthday, my dad took me
to the park, I got it, andit bent.
Ross  Yeah.
Phoebe  I never had a bike of my own.
Ross  (shocked) What?!
Phoebe  Well, we didnt have a lot of money. But the girl across the street
had the best bike! It was pink and it had rainbow colored tassels hanging off the
handle grips, and-and-and a bell and this big, white wicker basket with those
plastic daisies stuck on.
Chandler  That sounds like my first bike. (They all turn and look at him.) My
dad gave me his old one.
Ross  Ohh.
Monica  Did the girl ever let you ride it?
Phoebe  No! But she gave me the box that it came in. It had a picture of the
bike on the front. (Theyre all speechless) So I would sit on it and my step-dad
would drag me around the backyard.
Ross  That is so unfair!
Phoebe  Not really, I got to drag him around too! (They all nod,
"Oh.")
[Scene  Monica, Chandler, and Phoebe's, Monica is cooking, Joey is eating, and Chandler
is entering from the bedroom.]
Chandler  Hey! What are you guys doing?
Joey  Hey.
Monica  Making holiday candy for the neighbors.
Chandler  Im sorry, who?
Monica  Im gonna hang this basket (Points to the one sitting on the table)
on the door and when the neighbors walk by they can all take a piece.
Chandler  But we dont know the neighbors.
Joey  I do. Theres uh, lets see, Guy With a Mustache, Smokes-A-Lot
Lady, Some Kids Ive Seen, and A Red-haired Guy Who Does Not Like To Be Called Rusty.
Monica  See? This is exactly why Im making this candy. We can learn
their names and get to know our neighbors.
Chandler  Wouldnt it be easier if we just moved?
Rachel  (entering, happily) Gooood morning!!
Chandler  Eh, somebodys in a good mood!
Rachel  Well, why shouldnt I be? I have great friends! I have a wonderful
job!
Monica  Where you can make out with your assistant.
Rachel  Come on, its not a big deal! We stayed up all night coming up with
a plan so that us dating will not be a problem.
Monica  Oh yeah, whats the plan?
Rachel  (pauses as she thinks and exhales loudly) We We are not
going to let it be a problem.
Monica  Wow! It took you all night to come up with that plan?!
Rachel  Well yknow, we did other stuff too. (Joey and Chandler start to
giggle.)
Monica  Did you two
Rachel  Oh Monica come on, yknow I dont sleep with guys on the first
date!
Monica  Matt Guire, Mark Lynn, Ben Wire
Rachel  Anymore!!
Monica  Okay.
[Scene  Rachels Office, shes at her desk while the mailman delivers her
mail and calls Tag in.]
Rachel  Hi. Tag, I have a conference call today is that correct?
Rachel  Okay, thank you. Thatll be all. (The mail guy leaves and Tag
starts to follow, but Rachel stops him.) (Excitedly) Wait! Wait! (Rushes over and closes
the office-door.) Did you see that? That mail guy had no idea there was something going on
between us. (They kiss.)
Tag  Id better get back to my desk.
Rachel  Okay, you hard worker! Ill remember to put that in your
evaluation.
Tag  My what?
Rachel  Well, youve been here for two months now and your boss is required
to hand in a performance evaluation. But yknow, there is one thing that I have yet
to evaluate. (She turns around and sweeps the stuff off of her desk and hops up onto it.)
Tag  Are you serious?
Rachel  No, Ive just always wanted to do that. Can you help me clean this
up?
[Scene  The Hallway, Monica and Chandler are returning and Monica finds her basket is
empty.]
Monica  The basket is totally empty! My God, the neighbors ate all the candy!
Chandler  Well, either that or uh(Motions towards Joeys door.)
Monica  Joey!!
Joey  Yeah?
Monica  Did you eat all the neighbor candy?!
Joey  Uh well yeah, that was the plan, but by the time I got to it there was
only a couple of pieces left!
Phoebe  Yeah, and theyve been coming by all day. They love it!
Monica  They love my candy? Oh man!!! Ive gotta go make more!! (Starts to
do so.)
Joey  Hey Mon, you might wanna make some more lasagna too, because something
mightve happened to a huge chunk of it.
Monica  Ross! The neighbors ate all my candy!!
Ross  Mine stole my newspaper! Its like a crime wave!! (Monica runs
to make more candy.) Pheebs, you uh, you got a second.
Phoebe  Sure!
Ross  Yeah, ever since you uh, told me that story about that bike I-I
couldnt stop thinking about it. I mean, everyone should have a-a first bike,
so
Phoebe  (gasps) Oh my God Ross!!
Ross  You like it?
Phoebe  I love it!!
Ross  Yeah?
Phoebe  Ohh!! Ohh!! And I love you!
Ross  Ahh.
Phoebe  Not that way! But the bike brought you a lot closer!
Ross  Ah! (She hugs him.) Well uh-uh, t-take it downstairs, yknow give it
a test ride.
Phoebe  Okay! Oh my God! My first bike! Thank you for the best present Ive
ever gotten.
Ross  (stunned at the complement) Youre welcome.
Phoebe  (starts to leave, but stops) Oh and Chandlers about to cry.
Chandler  (about to cry) Am not!
[Scene  Monica, Chandler, and Phoebe's, the middle of the night, there is someone
knocking on the door and Monica and Chandler get up to answer it.]
Monica  (turning a light on) Who is that?!
Chandler  Dont worry, Im brave! I am brave! II am brave! (They
get to the door and Monica goes to open it.) No-no-no-no!! (He stops her.) (Through the
door.) Can you tell me who is there please?
The Knocker 
Gary  Hi!
Monica  Hi. Do you know what time it is?
Gary  Its candy time! My roommate says that they taste like little drops
of heaven.
Monica  Oh please! (To Chandler) Did you hear that? Little drops of heaven.
Gary  So, can I get some candy?
Chandler  I am sorry, but some of us have to get up early and go to work!
(Monica looks at him) (To Monica) He does not know that I am not some of us.
Monica  Umm, listen I am sorry, but Ill put some out first thing in the
morning.
Gary  Well okay, Ill swing by later. Do you live in this building?
Monica  Um-hmm.
Gary  (looking at Monica.) Mm! Seems like I wouldve remembered you!
Chandler  Mm! Night Gar! (Monica closes the door.)
[Scene  Rachels Office, shes slinking out to where Tag works and checks to
make sure no one is coming.]
Rachel  (hugging him) So did you read your evaluation yet?
Tag  No! It was marked confidential I just sent it down to Human Resources.
Rachel  (worried) Okay please, youre kidding right?! I wrote that one as a
joke for you!
Tag  A joke they would appreciate?
Rachel  Im thinkin no.
Tag  What did you say?!
Rachel  Umm, I said I thought you were a good kisser, and uh, and that I like
your tiney-tiny touchie.
Tag  No, not my touchie.
Rachel  Well, it gets worse. When asked if you take initiative I wrote,
"Yes, he was able to unhook my bra with minimal supervision," and under Problems
with Performance I wrote, "Dear God, I hope not," and then uh, then I drew a
little smiley face, and then a small pornographic sketch.
[Scene  Central Perk, Joey, Monica, Ross, and Chandler are watching Phoebe polish the
daisies on her bike outside.]
Monica  Ross! That is so sweet of you to get Phoebe that bike! When I heard the
story, I almost cried.
Joey  Almost cried huh? Hear that Chandler? Almost cried!
Chandler  Hey, you cry every time somebody talks about Titanic!
Joey  (about to cry) Those two only had each other!
Ross  Phoebe really likes the bike huh?
Monica  Oh yeah! I saw her walkin it down the street the other day. She
had uh, these flowers in the basket. It was so cute.
Joey  Yeah, I saw her this morning walkin it by the park.
Ross  Wait a minute, she was walking the bike? Both times?
Joey  Hey Pheebs?
Phoebe  Oh hi!
Chandler  Hey! So are you enjoying the bike?
Phoebe  Ohh, uh-huh so much!
Ross  Pheebs you uhyou do know how to ride a bike dont you?
Phoebe  Of course!
Monica  Umm, can we see you ride it?
Phoebe  Okay. (The gang is giggles then Phoebe gets the bike out of the rack,
gets on, pushes off, rolls a few feet, and falls over.) See?
[Scene  Monica, Chandler, and Phoebe's, Monica is making candy while Chandler and
Rachel are taste testing and Joey is on the couch doodling.]
Monica  See, this is why I told you never get involved with your assistant! And
here is no such thing as keeping secrets when it comes to affairs. (To Chandler) Did you
hear that Chandler? No such thing!
Chandler  (with his mouth full) What happened? Im just eating candy.
Rachel  Maybe its not as bad as I think. Yknow, maybe they
didnt take it the way I meant it.
Chandler  Absolutely! Yknow, because touchie can mean both ass and good
worker.
Rachel  Ugh, I just gotta get the thing back!
Joey  Hey Rach?
Rachel  Yeah?
Joey  That sketch you mentioned? Might it have looked a little something like
this? (He shows her what hes been drawing.)
Rachel  Oh my God! Joey!
Chandler  What is the matter with you?
Rachel  Ugh!
Joey  Boy I tell ya, this little talent came in handy before I could afford
porn.
The Woman  Hi! Im sorry, I know its after hours but I really need
candy.
Monica  Im sorry, I cant help you. See? (Points to her new sign.)
Rules are rules.
The Woman  Please! I have people coming from out of town today! And, I told them
all about your candy!
Monica  No kidding, out of towners huh? What did you tell em?
The Woman  I told em your candy is absolutely indescribable!
Monica  Some people have been saying its yknow little drops of heaven, but
whatever.
The Woman  Please, cant you help me out?
Joey  (watching the discussion) Hey Chandler, do we know that lady?
Chandler  Maybe, isnt she the woman who lives below you and has sex really
loud?
Monica  (still talking to the woman) All right, Ill do it just this once!
But you cant tell anybody!
The Woman  (exasperatedly) Yes! Yes! Please, just give it to me!
Joey and Chandler 
The Woman  (after Monica gives her the candy) Thank you.
Monica  (closing the door) Its unbelievable! I-I cant believe that
sign didnt work!
Chandler  Yknow what would work?
Monica  Hmm?
Chandler  Stop making candy!
Monica  But they like it!
Chandler  You mean they like you.
Monica  Maybe.
Chandler  Is that why you became a chef? So that people would like you?
Monica  Oh, you really want to talk about getting people to like you huh, funny
man? (Joey laughs but stops when Chandler turns to glare at him.)
[Scene  Central Park, Ross is teaching Phoebe how to ride her bike.]
Ross  Okay, now just remember everything I taught you and youll be fine.
Okay? Here we go. ReadySet
Phoebe  (hopping off the bike) Wait! This seat is really uncomfortable! Yeah,
maybe before we start we should just get another one. Perhaps, like an airplane
seator a beanbag chair!
Ross  Phoebe, you cant get out of this! Okay? You have to learn how
to ride a bike!
Phoebe  Why? Why do I have to learn?
Ross  WellIn-in case of emergency.
Phoebe  What kind of an emergency?
Ross  Well let therewhat if a man comes along and puts a gun to your head
and says, "You ride this bike or Ill shIll shoot you."
Phoebe  Okay, I would ring the bell to distract him and then I would knock the
gun out of his hand with a Chinese throwing star.
Ross  Okay, Phoebe just-just get-get on the bike andHey! Ill hold
you up and-and push you. Okay?
Phoebe  You wont let go?
Ross  No!
Phoebe  Swear?!
Ross  I swear!
Phoebe  (thinks it over) Okay.
Ross  Come on. (She gets on the bike.) All right, here we go. All right? (They
start.)
Phoebe  All right.
Ross  All right. Feel good?
Phoebe  Well
Ross  All right, try pedaling.
Phoebe  Okay. (Does so.)
Ross  Thats it, your doing great.
Phoebe  Okay.
Ross  Doing great! Yes-yes-yes! Take control! Yes!
Phoebe  Weee!!! (Ross pushes her and lets go.)
Ross  Yes!! Yes!!! (He starts clapping and Phoebe turns around to look at him
and falls off the bike.)
Phoebe  Oh! Oh! Oh no!! You swore!
Ross  I-I just thought you were doing so well. I
Phoebe  I am shocked! Shocked!! (She storms off leaving Ross to defend himself
from the angry looks from onlookers.)
Ross  Its a legitimate learning technique. (Looking around and seeing the
woman behind him glaring at him.) Wow!
[Scene  Monica, Chandler, and Phoebe's, Monica is making candy like mad as Ross
enters.]
Ross  Hey, theres uh, some people outside, askin about candy.
Monica  Well, theyre just gonna have to wait arent they? Ive
only got two hands!!
Ross  Need some help?
Monica  No! You dont know the system! Therell be nobody messing with
the system!
Ross  By the way, the week before your wedding you may not see a lot of me. (She
glares at him and he quickly makes his way to Phoebes room.)
Phoebe  (seeing him) Oh, hello liar.
Ross  (entering) Look, I-Im really sorry I let go of the bike.
Phoebe  I couldve been killed I hope you know!
Ross  I know. I know. But, can we please try it again? Huh? I mean, you were so
close Phoebe!
Phoebe  Well, I would love to butthe bike got stolen and the police have
no suspects. (Ross just happens to have his hand on a sheet that is covering something
that suspiciously looks like a bike.)
Ross  Phoebe.
Phoebe  What?! (Ross rings the bell.) What the hell?!
Ross  All right, yknow what? If you are not going to learn how to ride
this bike then Im sorry, Im just gonna have to take it back.
Phoebe  What?! Why?!
Ross  Because! Because, it-it-its Itd be like you having this
guitar (Points to hers) and-and never playing it. Okay, this guitar wants to be
played! And-and this bike wants to be ridden and-and if you dont ride it
you-youre-youre killing its spirit! (Pause) The bike is dying.
Phoebe  All right. If you care enough to make up that load of crap, okay.
Ross  Great! Great! (He runs to the door.) Youre making the bike very
happy.
Phoebe  (sarcastically) Okay Ross! (Ross exits and she says quietly to the bike)
Please dont die!
[Scene  Rachels office, Tag and her are planning how to get the review back.]
Rachel  Okay, I think we can get the evaluation back before they see it, but
were gonna have to get into Mr. Zelners office. Now, he doesnt get in
until 10, so hes no problem, but his assistant, Betty, she comes in early to eat her
breakfast at her desk.
Tag  Thats kinda sad.
Rachel  Yeah, well Bettys kinda sad. Which is why I believe I can lure her
away with these chocolates. (Holding up the box of chocolates.) Now, while I distract her,
you get in the office.
Tag  Got it!
Rachel  Lets roll!
Mr. Zelner  Hello Rachel, you uh, got a minute?
Rachel  (worried and shocked) Yeah, sure Mr. Zelner, for you
anythingminute. Okay. Fine. (To Tag) Abort the plan, abort the plan. (She start to
usher Tag out.)
Mr. Zelner  Uh actually, Id like to speak with both of you.
Rachel  Okay. Uh, well can we, can we get you anything Mr. Zelner? Maybe some
chocolates? (Holds up the box.)
Mr. Zelner  Umm, no. Thanks, but Ill give these to Betty. (Rachel glances
at Tag to say, "See?") So I read your evaluation of Tag, or to use his full
name, Tag Sweetcheeks Jones. Is something going on with you two?
Rachel  (laughs) Oh my God. Can you imagine if there was?! I mean, (getting
serious) what would happen exactly.
Mr. Zelner  Well, Id be forced to file a report. Id have to consult
with the legal department, and your future at the company would be in jeopardy.
Rachel  Well
Tag  (interrupting) Uh Mr. Zelner, Im the one who filled in that
evaluation.
Rachel  Oh no-no-no
Tag  (interrupting again) Yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah, I thought it would be funny.
Mr. Zelner  You wrote that you have a cute touchie?
Tag  (pause) Yes. I have a weird sense of humor, and Im kinda
strangely proud of my butt.
Mr. Zelner  Its kind of a risky joke Tag, and what is-what is this drawing
I cant figure out what this is?
Rachel  Youre lookin at it upside downyknow what? (Grabs
the evaluation and throws it out.) It doesnt matter.
Mr. Zelner  Yeah, its not like I dont have a sense of humor, huh?
Hell, I even enjoy a naughty limerick now and then. But theres a time and a place,
huh?! Unless you uh, have a limerick right now? (They both nod no.) No? Okay, well uh,
youve (Grabs the chocolates.) got my fax number. (Exits.)
Rachel  Whoa! I cant believe you did that. That was really sweet.
Tag  No, dont worry about it.
Rachel  No, you couldve lost your job.
Tag  Are you kidding me?! With a cute butt like this, Id find work.
Rachel  Thank you! Youre great! (They kiss.)
Tag  Yknow what?
Rachel  What?
Tag  I feel great. (Rachel laughs) In fact! (Walks over to her desk, sweeps its
contents onto the floor and Rachel just glares at him.) What?
Rachel  I It justit took me so long to get that desk organized.
Tag  Oh, Im sorry. (He bends over to pick the stuff up.)
Rachel  (looking at his butt) There it is. (They hug.)
[Scene  The Hallway, Chandler is returning from work to see the hallway jammed full of
people waiting outside their door.]
Chandler  (asking a man leaning against the wall) What is going on?
The Man  Were waiting for the candy. (Yelling at the door.) Bring out the
candy!
Joey  Yeah lady! Give us candy!!
Chandler  Joey!
Joey  Whats up buddy?
Chandler  What are you doing?
Joey  Waiting for candy.
Chandler  Get in here! (They head for the door and Chandler sees Smokes-A-Lot
Lady standing next to the door and smoking, to her) Hey, and you can not smoke in here!
(Takes the cigarette and takes a drag for himself.) (Exhaling in ecstasy) Merry Christmas.
Monica  (opening the door and frantically) Okay, guys! The candy is coming; I
just need another 15 minutes for the chocolate to cool!
All  We want candy! We want candy now! (And other general commotion
sounds.)
Chandler  All right everybody! Just be quiet! Be quiet! Be quiet!!
Pipe-pipe-pipe down! (They settle down) What is the matter with you people?! This woman
was trying to do a nice thing for you. She was making candy so she could try to get to
know all of you, and Ill bet that not one of you can tell me her name! Am I right?
The Man  (from earlier) Candy Lady?
Chandler  No not (imitating) Candy Lady.
Joey  (stepping in and knocking the man over) Hey, if we know it can we have
candy?!!
Chandler  All right, yknow what? Forget it, all of you forget it!
Youve ruined it! Go home! Youve ruined it! Youve ruined it!
Joey  Thats right, its all ruined! You guys ruined everything! You
ruined it! (Steps into the apartment and Chandler closes the door.) (Joey struts over to
the candy and starts eating it.)
Monica  (To Chandler) Thank you.
Chandler  Youre welcome. (They kiss.)
Monica  Did you smoke?
Chandler  No! Smokes-A-Lot Lady blew smoke directly into my mouth.
Eh-uhare you okay?
Monica  Im fine now, but it was really scary there for a while. I mean,
someone slipped a-a threatening note under the door.
Joey  (with his mouth full) Oh yeah, sorry about that. Mob mentality or
whatever, I dont know (Grabs the note.)
[Scene  Central Park, Phoebe is now riding her bike with ease and stops in front of
Ross. They both giggle.]
Phoebe  I cant believe it! I did it! I rode a bike! I never thought
Id be able to do that! Thank you Ross.
Ross  Oh hey, dont thank me, thank yourself. Youre the one who faced
her fears and ultimately overcame them.
Phoebe  Dont be so corny Ross, its not an after-school special. (She
rides off and the camera pans down to reveal two shiny, silver training wheels firmly
attached.)
[Scene  Monica, Chandler, and Phoebe's, Chandler is on the phone, Rachel and Monica are
sitting in the kitchen.]
Chandler  Buh-bye. (Hangs up the phone) I just got us reservations at
Michelles and tickets to the Musicman to celebrate our first holiday season
as a betroughed couple.
Monica  Betrothed (Corrects him)
Chandler  betrothed couple.
Phoebe  (entering carrying a skull) Hey!
Chandler  Hey!
Rachel and Monica 
Phoebe  Haaaa... (Puts the skull on the table) ... ahhhh!
Chandler  Pheebs?
Phoebe  Huh?
Chandler  Skull?
Phoebe  Oh, yeah, it's my mom's.
Rachel  (freaking out) Oh my god!!
Phoebe  No, no, no. It's not! It's not my mom. It belonged to mom. Yeah, no, she
used to put it out every Christmas to remind us, that even though it's Christmas, people
still die. And, you can put candy in it. (She grabs the skull, pulls out a stick of
licorice, and takes a bite.)
Ross  (entering) Hey!
All  Hey!
Monica  (Offering Ross the skull) Licorice?
Ross  (Thinking it over) Sure! (Takes one) Hey, I just found out, I get Ben for
the holidays this year.
All  Ohh! That's great!
Monica  Are you gonna dress up as Santa?
Ross  Nope. I mean, I know Susan does every year, but I think I wanna take this
year to teach him all about Hanukkah.
Phoebe  And maybe I could teach Ben about the Christmas skull and how people
die.
Rachel  You may need to use this year to teach Ben about Phoebe.
Ross  Hmm.
Joey  Hey. (He exits)
Rachel  (to Monica) Did you know he was in there?
Monica  No.
Chandler  How long have we been home?
Monica  About a half an hour.
Chandler  Lovely!
[Scene  Central Perk, Chandler is getting a cup of coffee and sits down next to
Monica.]
Chandler  Hey, you know what I was thinking? When we get married, are you gonna
change your last name to Bing?
Monica  No.
Chandler  Why not?
Monica  Bing's weird.
Phoebe  (entering) Oh, hey, you guys!
Chandler  Hey!
Monica  Hey!
Phoebe  Hey. Guess what! My landlord just called and my apartment is gonna get
ready soon, so I guess I'll be moving out.
Monica  Ahh, Phoebe, I'm gonna miss you!
Phoebe  Yes, you will be very sad. All right, well I gotta go tell Rachel the
good news.
Chandler  Ohh! You guys gonna be living together again?
Phoebe  Yeah, why not?
Chandler  Well, she's just so much fun with Joey, I just assumed, she'd still be
living with him.
Phoebe  Why do you think, she's having so much fun living with Joey?
Chandler  No reason, exceptshetoldme.
Phoebe  Really? So she said, she didnt wanna live with me anymore?
Chandler  No! No, she didn't say that. I-I-I think you should talk to Monica
now.
Monica  Phoebe, don't worry about it. I'm sure she wants to live with you.
Phoebe  You're sure? You're absolutely sure?
Monica  Well, no. But, um, I bet she probably does.
Phoebe  Probably? Yeah, I don't like that word. (Chandler and Monica look
surprised) Kind of what probably really means. Yeah, uh-huh. Yeah, oh,
"Your mom probably won't kill herself," yknow? I'm sorry, but I'm not
hanging all my hopes of Rachel and I living together on-on "Probably!"
Yknow? You gotta take care of yourselves! (She starts to walk out) In this
world history teaches us nothing! (Exits)
Chandler  Bing doesn't seem so weird now, does it?
[Scene  Joey and Rachels, Joey is sitting behind a red drum set.]
Rachel  (entering) Hey!
Joey  Hey! Great, youre home! Guess what Phoebe got me for Christmas!
(Starts drumming.)
Rachel  Drums?
Joey  (yelling) No! Drums!
[Scene  Michelle's, Chandler and Monica enter.]
Chandler  (to the Maitre d') Hi, could we get two burritos to go, please?
(Laughs.)
Monica  I'm sorry. But not that sorry, 'cause you don't have to live with it.
Um, we have a reservation under the name Chandler Bing.
Maitre d'  Oh-kay, we'll have a table for you in about 45 minutes.
Maitre d'  I'm sorry. Christmas is a very busy time, sir.
Chandler  Is this because of the burrito thing?
Monica  (pulling Chandler away from the Maitre d') You need to give him money.
Chandler  Give him money? It was a joke!
Monica  No, to get a table! Places like are always shakin you down.
Everybody wants to be paid off.
Chandler  Right, calm down, O'Mally. I'll slip him some money.
Monica  You've got to be smooth about it.
Chandler  Hey, I can be smooth. (Walks back to the Maitre d', very smoothly)
Listen, we're a little bit in a hurry, so, if you can get us a table a little quicker, I'd
appreciate it. (Shakes his hand)
Maitre d'  Of course, sir.
Chandler  Okay. (Walks back to Monica)
Monica  How did it go?
Chandler  Had the money in the wrong hand. (Shows her his left hand with the
money in it)
[Scene  Ross's apartment, Ross is whirling Ben around.]
Ross  Wooooooo, hehehe. Hey, ahh, you don't feel like you're gonna throw up, do
ya?
Ben  No.
Ross  Well, I do, so let's... (Ben and Ross sit down on the couch) So, Ben, you
uh, you know what holiday is coming up, don't ya?
Ben  Christmas.
Ross  Yep, and you know what other holiday is coming up?
Ben  Christmas eve.
Ross  Yes, but also (Pauses to let Ben answer, but he doesnt.) Hanukkah!
See, you're part Jewish, and-and Hanukkah is a Jewish holiday.
Ben  Santa has reindeers that can fly!
Ross  Right, um, but, on Hanukkah, Hanukkah is a celebration of a miracle. See,
years and years ago there were these people called the Maccabees.
Ben  (singing) Jingle bells, jingle bells...
Ross  (interrupts him) Okay, that's right, yes, but on Hanukkah, uh, we sing, uh
(Sings) Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel, I made you out of clay.
Ben  (singing) Rudolph, the red-nosed reindeer...
Ross  (interrupts him again) Okay, it's not a contest.
Ben  When is Santa coming?
Ross  Well, how about this year, instead of Santa, we have fun celebrating
Hanukkah?
Ben  No Santa? Was I bad?
Ross  No! Oh, no-no-no. Hey, you weren't bad, you've been very good, Ben.
Ben  Santa's mad at me.
Ross  No, hey-hey, come on, (He grabs Ben and sits him on his lap) Ben, Santa is
not mad at you, okay? Hey, you're-you're his favorite little guy!
Ben  So Santa's coming?
Ross  (disappointed) Yes! Santa's coming!
[Scene  Michelle's, Chandler and Monica are discussing how to bribe the Maitre
d'.]
Monica  It's easy! Just keep it casual! Give him a kind word, shake his hand and
give him the money!
Chandler  How do you know so much about this?
Monica  I don't know.
Chandler  Richard used to do it, didn't he?
Monica  We'd be eating our soup right now.
Chandler  Mustached bastard
Monica  (sees two people exit) Okay, those people just left, come on! Quick!
Give him the money and get their table!
Chandler  (walks up to the Maitre d') Excuse me...
Male Guest  (to the Maitre d') Good evening. (Shakes his hand)
Chandler  (finds his money) Ahh-hahaha! (Turns around to give the Maitre d' his
money, but he isn't there anymore)
[Scene  The Hallway, Phoebe comes up the stairs and hears drumming coming from Joey and
Rachel's, so she enters smiling and then sees that Rachel, not Joey, is the one playing.]
Rachel  (stopping at Phoebes entrance) Ha!
Phoebe  So you like the drums! That's, that's great! Yknow, I was worried,
that, you know, they would maybe an unbearable living situation. All right, okay, well,
apparently not! So, yay!
Joey  Hey-hey, Pheebs, check it out, we already learned a song. (To Rachel)
Ready? One, two, three, four...
Rachel and Joey 
Phoebe  That's fun. (She exits disappointedly.)
[Scene  Central Perk, Gunther is serving Chandler and Monica coffee.]
Gunther  Here you go.
Chandler  Thank you Gunther, put it there. (He gets up, and shakes Gunther's
hand. A bunch of coins fall out his hand. He sits down next to Monica.) Definitely not
easier with coins. (Joey gets up and picks up the coins. Chandler thinks, Joey is just
helping him to pick them up.) Thank you.
Joey  Thank you. (He gets up and puts on his jacket.) (Phoebe enters) Hey
Pheebs!
Phoebe  Hey!
Joey  Here. (Gives her the coins) Now I only owe you $49.50.
Chandler  Hey Pheebs!
Phoebe  Hey! (she sits down next to him)
Chandler  If you wanna give Joey a Christmas present that disrupts the entire
building, why not get him something a little bit more subtle, like a wrecking ball, or a
vile of small pox to release in the hallway?
Monica  It's not just the drum noise. Every five minutes, Joey throws his sticks
in the air, and I have to hear, "Oh my eye! Oh god, my eye!" I mean, it is so
annoying.
Phoebe  Yes, thank you. You see, this is how normal people are supposed to react
to drums.
Monica  Phoebe, you got Joey drums to annoy Rachel, so she wouldn't wanna live
there anymore?
Phoebe  Maybe on some level.
[Scene  Joey and Rachel's, Joey is sitting behind the drums wearing safety goggles,
hitting them with his sticks as Rachel watches.]
Rachel  Joey, yknow that you could just not throw the sticks up in the
air.
Joey  What is Rock 'n' Roll about that?
Phoebe  (entering with an aquarium covered by a towel) Hey, Joey, I got you
another present. (She puts it on the counter)
Joey  Oh wait, before you tell me what it is! (He plays a drum-roll) Okay, what
is it?
Phoebe  It's atarantula! (Joey almost falls down from his drum-stool
jumping up) Oh! God! Rachel, look, I'm sorry. What was I thinking giving Joey this big,
gross, scary spider in such a poorly constructed cage?
Rachel  What are you talking about? I love them! (Looks into the cage) Yeah, I
had a tarantula when I was a kid. But it-it died, because my cat ate it. And then, then my
cat died. But Joey, isn't this cool?
Joey  Is it on me? I feel, I feel like it's on me! I got, hey! (He storms into
his room)
Rachel  Oh, isn't that adorable? Joey is afraid of the tarantula.
Phoebe  (sarcastic) Ah, yeah, he's so adorable, God, he's just so much fun, Joey
is the best, I'm glad you're having so much fun here. (She turns around, about to leave)
Rachel  What? Wait-wait a minute, what? Phoebe, what's the matter?
Phoebe  Our apartment is ready.
Rachel  And that makes you angry because
Phoebe  Because you would rather live here with Joey.
Rachel  Where did you get that?
Phoebe  Monica and Chandler said that you were having so much fun here. And
apparently no amount of drums or tarantulas is gonna change that.
Rachel  Phoebe?
Phoebe  Hm?
Rachel  Did you get all this stuff for Joey to try and drive me out of the
apartment? Honey, if you wanted to do that, you might as well just gotten him a fish, you
know how fish freaked me out!
Phoebe  (nods along) Fish!
Rachel  It wouldn't have mattered anyway, Phoebe, you and I are, are gonna live
together, we're roommates; that's the deal.
Phoebe  Yes, but I wanted you to want to live with me, but okay, if you're
having so much fun over here
Rachel  Oh, it's so much more fun with you.
Phoebe  We did have fun, didn't we?
Rachel  We did!
Phoebe  Oh, anyway, they say, if we want, we can see it tonight.
Rachel  Oh, I would love to!
Phoebe  Yay, okay!
Rachel  Good, good, good, good, good. (She runs to the drums and gets the
sticks)
Phoebe  Great, all right, okay, and Monica ask me to make the drumming stop.
Rachel  (with the sticks in her hands) Um... (She goes to the tarantula-cage and
puts the sticks into it) Done!
[Scene  Halloween Adventure, a costume shop, there is a salesman behind the
counter, Ross enters.]
Ross  Hey!
Salesman  Hello, Sir. You're here to return those pants?
Ross  No, these are my pants.
Salesman  Oh. Okay! How can I help you?
Ross  Well, uh, do you have a Santa-outfit left?
Salesman  Two days before Christmas? Sorry, man.
Ross  Okay look, do-do, you have anything Christmassy? I promised my son, and I
really don't want to disappoint him, um, come on, Iuh, you gotta have something.
[Scene  Monica, Chandler, and Phoebe's, Monica has just opened the door for Ross who is
costumed as an Armadillo. Ben is standing next to her.]
Ross  I'm the holiday armadillo! I'm a friend of Santa's and he sent me here to
wish you (Points to Ben) a Merry Christmas!
Monica  What happened to Santa, Holiday Armadillo?
Ross  (to Monica) Santa was unavailable so close to Christmas.
Monica  Wow, come in, have a seat. You must be exhausted coming all the way
fromTexas.
Ben  Texas?
Ross  That's right, Ben. I'm Santa's representative for all the southern states.
And Mexico! But, Santa sent me here to give you these presents, Ben. (He tries to bend
down to pick up the bag with the presents, but can't because of the costume) Maybe the
Lady will help me with these presents.
Ben  Wow! Thanks!
Ross  You're welcome, Ben. Merry Christmas, ooh, and Happy Hanukkah!
Ben  Are you for Hanukkah, too? Because I'm part-Jewish.
Ross  (gasps) You are? Me, too!
Monica  Because Armadillos also wandered in the desert?
Ross  (to Monica) You wanna wander in the hall? (to Ben) Ooh, hey Ben, what if
the Holiday Armadillo told you all about the festival of lights?
Ben  Cool!
Ross  Yeah!
Monica  Come on Ben.
Ross  Years and years ago there were these people called the Maccabees...
Chandler  (entering in a Santa costume) Ho, ho, ho! Merry Christmas!
Ben  Santa! (Runs to Chandler and hugs him)
Chandler  Hey! (Grunts as Ben hits him at full speed.)
Ross  What are you doing here, Santa?
Chandler  Well, I'm here to see my old buddy Ben. What are you doing here,
weirdturtle-man?
Ross  I'm the Holiday Armadillo, your part-Jewish friend. You sent me here to
give Ben some presents. Remember?
Chandler  What?
Ben  Did you bring me any presents, Santa?
Chandler  You bet I did, Ben, put it there! (He shakes Ben's hand, but the money
falls out of his hands) (to Monica) Well, it would have worked this time, if his hands
weren't so damn small! (Realizes, that Ben is standing right there) Ho, ho, ho!
Monica  Okay Ben, why don't you come open some more presents, and Santa, the
Armadillo, and I have a little talk in the kitchen? There's a sentence, I never thought
I'd say.
Ross  (to Chandler) What are you doing?
Chandler  You called everyone and said you were having trouble finding a Santa
costume, so I borrowed one from a guy at work!
Ross  Thank you, but, but you gotta leave.
Chandler  Why?
Ross  Because, I'm finally getting him excited about Hanukkah, and, and
you're-youre wrecking it.
Chandler  But I didn't get to shape my belly like a bowl full of jelly.
Ross  I'm sorry, Chandler but this, this is really important to me.
Chandler  Fine, I'll give the suit back.
Monica  (to Chandler) Hey, you think, you can keep it another night? (She has a
really teasing look on her face and keeps twirling Chandler's beard.)
Chandler  Santa? Really?
Monica  Yes, is that okay?
Chandler  Did your Dad ever dress up like Santa?
Monica  No.
Chandler  Then it's okay! (They kiss.)
Ross  Okay Ben, Santa has to go. Say good-bye!
Ben  No! Why does he have to go?
Chandler  Because, if Santa and the HolidayArmadillo? (Ross nods) ...are
ever in the same room for too long the universe will implode. Merry Christmas!
Ben  No! Why can't the Armadillo leave? I want Santa!
Ross  Fine, I-I give up. Santa, Santa can stay.
Chandler  Well, I'll stay, but only because I wanna hear about Hanukkah. Ben,
will you sit here with Santa and learn about Hanukkah?
Ben  Okay, Santa!
Ross  All right, it's time for the story of Hanukkah. Years and years ago, there
were these people called the Maccabees.
Joey  (entering wearing a Superman costume) Merry Christmas!
[Scene  Phoebe and Rachel's, they are entering to check out the newly refurbished
apartment.]
Rachel  Oh wow! Look at this place!
Phoebe  Oh, this is terrible. Oh, theyve made so many changes I cant
even feel my grandmothers presence anymoreOoh! New sconces!
Rachel  (yelling from another room) Oh my God!
Phoebe  What?
Rachel  (returning) Okay, remember uh, remember how you told me that your
grandmother put up that wall to make that into two bedrooms?
Phoebe  Yeah?
Rachel  And remember how you always said you were afraid the landlord would find
out and then tear it down?
Phoebe  Yeah?
Rachel  Do you really not know where Im going with this? (Phoebe nods,
"No.") It left! Its one huge room!
Phoebe  Oh no! (She runs to see.) (Running back, excitedly) Oh! Wow!!!
Rachel  See?
Phoebe  Well, I guess well just have to put the wall back up.
Rachel  You cant, because of the new skylight!
Phoebe  Theres a skylight?! (Runs to see and yells from the bedroom.)
Wow!!
Rachel  So what should we do? Should we start looking for a new place?
Phoebe  (returning slowly) Yknow Im-Im sensing that um, my
grandmother would not be comfortable with that.
Rachel  Oh yeah? Startin to feel her again there are we?
Phoebe  A little bit, yeah.
Rachel  Pheebs is your grandmother maybe saying that you should live here alone?
Phoebe  You heard her too?! You have the gift!
Rachel  Phoebe, its okay. I like living with Joey.
Phoebe  Are you sure?
Rachel  Oh please, I hate packing, its closer to work, and we do have fun.
Although, Im really gonna miss living with you.
Phoebe  Oh me too.
Rachel  I know. (They hug.) Oh-oh, wait did you hear that-hear that? Listen,
Im gettin something from your grandmother, she said that since you get to keep
the one bedroom apartment you should give Rachel the purple chair?
Phoebe  No, I do not hear that.
[Scene  Monica, Chandler, and Phoebe's, Santa (Chandler), Superman (Joey), Ben,
and Monica are listening to the Holiday Armadillo (Ross) finish telling the story of
Hanukkah.]
Ross  and the miracle was that that little bit of oil that shouldve
just lasted just one day, burned for
Ben  (answering him) Eight whole days.
Ross  Thats right, and thats why we celebrate Hanukkah today. The
end.
Ben  Awesome!
Ross  Yeah?
Chandler  My favorite part was when Superman flew all the Jews out of
Egypt. (Glaring at Joey whos nodding.)
Ross  The Armadillo was actually not so thrilled about that part! Okay
Ben, its time to light the Hanukkah candles! (Santa, Superman, Monica, Ben,
and the Holiday Armadillo go over to the menorah to light the candles.)
Rachel  (entering with Phoebe) Hey!
Phoebe  Oh.
Rachel  (seeing the collection of characters.) Wow! It looks like the Easter
Bunnys funeral in here.
Ross  Come on, come on, were-were-were lighting the candles!
Rachel  Oh.
Phoebe  Oh.
Phoebe  Okay, I understand why Superman is here, but why is there a
porcupine at the Easter Bunnys funeral?
[Scene  Joey and Rachel's, Rachel is closing the door on the tarantula cage.]
Rachel  I got it!
Joey  (yelling from the bedroom) Is it back in the cage?
Rachel  Its back in cage!
Joey  Cage closed?
Rachel  Joey, would you just come out here and stop being such a baby!

With Help from
[Scene  Chandler and Monicas, Chandler is sitting at the kitchen table eating
cheesecake. The box it came in is also on the table.]
Chandler  Ohh. Mmm.
Rachel  (Comes in the front door and walks towards the kitchen.) Hi.
Chandler  Hey, you have got to try this cheesecake.
Rachel  Oh, yknow I'm not that much of a sweet tooth. I(Chandler
puts a forkful of the cheesecake in her mouth.)Wow. My God, so creamy. Oh my God,
this is the best cheesecake I have ever had. Where did you get this? (She reaches over to
look at the label on the box.)
Chandler  (nervously) It was at the front door. When I got home. Somebody sent
it to us.
Rachel  Chandler, this is not addressed to you. This is addressed to Mrs.
Braverman downstairs. (Gasping) Thief.
Chandler  Ino! I didn't read the box before I opened it. And you can't
return a box after you've opened the box.
Rachel  Why, why not?
Chandler  Because it's too delicious.
Rachel  Chandler, you stole this cheesecake. That is wrong.
Chandler  No-no-no! It is going to be okay, because Mrs. Braverman is gonna send
away for a free one and that way we all win! The only losers are the big cheesecake
conglomerate, (Reading the label) Mommas Little Bakery. (Pause) I feel terrible,
Im a horrible, horrible, horrible person.
Rachel  (taking a bite) Oh, Im sorry what?
[Scene  Central Perk, everyone except Rachel is there as Joey gets up and starts
putting on his coat.]
Joey  All right, I should get going, big day a work. Yknow Im in a
coma? Today, they do this test on me and it turns out Im not brain dead.
Chandler  So
Joey  Ah-ah-ah Mr. Smartie Pants, its just not my character thats
not brain dead. Hey, so Pheebs, we still on for tonight?
Phoebe  Absolutely!
Phoebe  Okay. (Joey exits.)
Phoebe  Oh, I have dinner plans with Joey. We get together about once a month to
discuss the rest of you guys.
Ross  Wow, did not know that! May I say how lovely you look today?
Phoebe  Duly noted.
Ross  Thanks. (Phoebe gets up to get a refill.) (To Monica) Oh! So for tomorrow,
do you want to rent a car and drive down together or what?
Monica  What are you talking about?
Ross  Cousin Frannies wedding, its tomorrow night.
Monica  You were invited?!
Ross  No.
Monica  My God, I cant believe this! I mean I knew that mom and dad were
invited, but I thought that was it! I mean from the ages 7 to 9 Frannie and I were
inseparable!
Chandler  Well, maybe since the age of 9, Frannies made some new friends.
Ross  Well l-look okay, its probably just a mistake. Let me call Aunt
Sheryl okay? Maybe you are invited and the invitation just got lost in the mail.
Monica  Yeah, well you call her and tell her that yknow when we were kids
her precious little Frannie tried to undress me several times, okay? And if I hadnt
have stopped her, there probably wouldnt even be a wedding to go too.
Ross  Yknow, she tried to undress me too.
Chandler  I used to undress my cousin Glenn. (Monica looks at him then sushes
him.)
[Scene  Joey and Rachel's, Monica, Chandler, Rachel, and Ross are playing Monopoly
as Phoebe enters angrily.]
Phoebe  Joseph Francis Tribbiani are you home yet?!!
Rachel  Umm, I think hes still out. Whats wrong?
Phoebe  Well, Ill tell you Rachel Karen Green, I had plans with Joey
tonight and he left me this note. (Hands it to Rachel.)
Rachel  (reading the note) "Pheebs, cant make it, got a date. Talk to
you later. Big Daddy." (Laughs) Big Daddy?
Phoebe  Oh thats a nickname we were trying out.
Ross  Hey, yknow what nickname never caught on? The Ross-A-Tron! (Monica
shakes her head in disgust.)
Joey  (entering) Hey!
Phoebe  Oh! Heres Joseph Francis!
Joey  Oh-Wha-Ho! What are you middle naming me for?! I left you a note!
Phoebe  So what?! That doesnt give you the right to ditch me!
Joey  Hey, you can cancel plans with friends if there is the possibility for
sex!
Ross  Phoebe hes right, that is the rule.
Phoebe  I dont accept this rule. When me make plans, I expect you to show
up. Okay, I cant just be a way to kill time til you meet someone better!
Yknow boyfriends and girlfriends come and go, but this (Motions that their
friendship) is for life!
Joey  Wow! Im so sorry; I had no idea it would bother you this much.
Phoebe  Well, it does.
Joey  Okay, can I-can I make it up to you? Huh? Im sorry. (They hug.) How
about uh, dinner tomorrow night?! Ill pay for myself!
Phoebe  Okay, you wore me down.
Ross  Hey Joe, while youre over there how about another beer for the
Ross-A-Tron?
Joey  The RossIs that back?!! (Chandler motions no.)
[Scene  Monica and Chandler's, Rachel enters to find Chandler staring at another
cheesecake box.]
Rachel  Hi!
Chandler  Another cheesecake came! They delivered it to the wrong address again!
Rachel  So just bring it back downstairs, whats the problem?
Chandler  I cant seem to say goodbye.
Rachel  Are you serious?! Chandler, we ate an entire cheesecake two days ago and
you want more?
Chandler  Well Ive forgotten what it tastes like okay?!
Rachel  It was cheesecake. It was fine. It had a buttery, crumbly, graham
cracker crust, with a very rich yet light, cream cheese filling (Pause) Wow! My
whole mouth just filled with saliva!
Chandler  (closing the box) Yknow what? Forget it! We are just
hungry! We have not had lunch! We are just light-headed! So let us go out and have lunch
and forget about the cheesecake.
Rachel  Yeah and well drop it off downstairs so that were not
tempted.
Chandler  Good idea. Where do you want to go to lunch?
Rachel  Mommas Little Bakery, Chicago, Illinois. (They exit with the
cheesecake.)
[Scene  Central Perk, Monica and Joey are there. Joey is reading a newspaper.]
Joey  Awww! Mel Torme died.
Monica  Joey, that papers like a year old!
Joey  Aw! Does that mean the Sam Goodys sale is over?!
Ross  (entering) Hey.
Joey  Hey.
Monica  Hey.
Ross  So I finally heard back from Aunt Sheryl and apparently it wasnt
a mistake. Ahh, theres-theres limited seating in the hall.
Monica  Limited seating?! (Screechingly) I am just one tiny person!
Ross  Well yeah, but she doesnt know that. I mean, the last time she saw
you-you wouldve turned one of those little wedding chairs into kindling.
Monica  (disgusted) Limited seating! Oh, that is such a lame excuse! Thats
not the reason shes not inviting me!
Ross  Oh whats the big deal?! I wasnt even invited to the ceremony,
just the reception. And-and yknow what? If it makes you feel any better, Joan and I
will just make an appearance and then, and then well-well leave early as a
sign of protest.
Monica  Joan?
Ross  Yeah, Joan Tedeski my date. Shes an assistant professor in the
Linguistics department. Tall, very beautiful, and despite what some people say, not
broad backed!
Monica  Wait a minute, you got Ross Gellar and guest?! I wasnt invited and
you got "and guest?!"
Joey  Uh-uh, excuse me, I do have to interrupt on Rosss behalf. I-I think
the rule applies here yknow, since she has a chance to get on broad back
Ross  (interrupting) Not broad backed!
Monica  Wait a minute, yknow, youre bringing me!
Ross  What? I cant cancel on Joan!
Monica  Why not?!
Ross  BecDid you not hear me?! Shes an assistant professor in the
Linguistics department, okay? Theyre wild! Why do you want to come anyway?
Monica  Because! Shes my cousin. I mean, we grew up together! Were
family yknow? Well thats important to me.
Ross  Okay, all right, Ill take you. Ill go call Joan. (Does so.)
Joey  Aww thats nice. Family should be there, huh? This is her wedding,
happiest day of her life.
Monica  (laughs) Well see.
[Scene  The Lobby of Chandler and Rachels building, Chandler and Rachel are
returning from lunch.]
Chandler  Well, thank you for lunch.
Rachel  What? Wait a minute, I didnt pay, I thought you paid!
Chandler  So apparently we just dont pay for food anymore. (Rachel laughs
then Chandler notices something.) Do you see what I see?
Rachel  (gasps) Its still there! (The cheesecake they returned to Mrs. Braverman
is still lying in front of her door.)
Chandler  Mrs. Braverman must be out. (They move closer to it.)
Rachel  She could be out of town. Maybe shell be gone for months.
Chandler  By then, the cheesecake may have gone bad. We dont want her to
come back to bad cheesecake.
Rachel  No that could kill her.
Chandler  Well, we dont want that.
Rachel  No so were protecting her.
Chandler  But we should take it.
Rachel  But we should move quick.
Chandler  Why?
Rachel  Because I think I just heard her moving around in there.
Chandler  Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! (Rachel grabs the cheesecake
and they take off upstairs.)
[Scene  Central Perk, Monica and Phoebe are entering. As Phoebe is sitting down, she
recognizes someone sitting at the counter.]
Phoebe  (gasps) (whispering) Oh my God! Thats David!
Monica  David who?
Phoebe  David the scientist guy, David that I was in love with, David who went
to Russia and broke my heart David!
David  (noticing Phoebe) Oh my God!
Phoebe  Oh, you say someones name enough, they turn around.
David  Phoebe?
Phoebe  David! (He kisses her cheek) What-what are you doing here? Arent
you supposed to be in Russia?
David  Yeah, Im just, Im just in town for a conference. Umm, God
you look phenomenal!
Phoebe  Well Yeah. You look great too. Did you get a haircut?
David  Yeah. Well I-I got like thirty of them.
Phoebe  Yeah.
David  Umm, look I-I-I got a confession to make
Phoebe  Uh-huh.
David  Uh, I-I-I was hoping to run into you here. I didnt know whether I
should call or not, yknow I-I was only in town for a few days. And yknow, I
didnt want to intrude on your life or-or anything like that, but I-I really wanted
to see you andbut I didnt know if you wanted to see me.
Phoebe  Well, of course I would want to see you. II think about you all
the time.
David  Really? Because I think about you all the time.
Phoebe  Really?
David  I mean, theres a statue in Minsk
Phoebe  Uh-huh.
David  That reminds me of you so much, I mean umm, it-its actually
of Lenin. But, yknow at certain angles
Phoebe  Yeah.
David  Umm, anywayDo you want to have dinner tonight?
Phoebe  (excited) Yes! Oh no!
David  (disappointed) Oh. Uh, what?
Phoebe  I cant. I cant believe I have plans, I cant. Can you
do it tomorrow night though?
David  Uh no, I have to go in a few hours. I have to be on the red-eye. Well
listen, yknow, next time youre in Minsk umm
Monica  Phoebe, can I talk to you for a second?
Phoebe  Uh-huh. (They go over and talk.)
Monica  What are you doing?
Phoebe  Well, I have plans with Joey tonight.
Monica  So! Hell understand!
Phoebe  No he wont. And thats not even the point! Monica, I made a
whole speech about you do not cancel plans with friends! And now yknow what? Just
because, potentially, the love of my life comes back from Russia just for one night, I-I
should change my beliefs?! I should change beliefs! No! No! No, if I dont have my
principles, I dont have anything!
Monica  God, you are so strong.
[Scene  Joey and Rachel's, Rachel and Chandler are eating the cheesecake right out of
the box.]
Rachel  (taking a bite) Oh my God! That is so good!
Chandler  Im full, and yet I know if I stop eating this, Ill regret
it.
Joey  (entering) Hey!
Rachel  Hey!
Joey  (seeing what theyre doing) What do you got there?
Rachel  Oh its umm, its tofu cake. Do you want some? (He makes a
disgusted noise and heads for his room, Chandler follows him in.)
Chandler  What are you doing tonight?
Joey  Huh? Uh (He starts taking off his pants.)
Chandler  Dude! Dude! (Motions that Joey should pull up his pants.)
Joey  Oh! (Pulls up his pants.) Sorry. Uh, Ive got those plans with
Phoebe, why?
Joey  What?! Tonight?!
Chandler  Thats what Monica said.
Joey  After she gave me that big speech?! She goes and makes a date with a guy
on the same night she has plans with me? I think shes trying to pull a fast one on
Big Daddy!
[Scene  Cousin Frannies Wedding Reception, Monica and Ross are entering and
finding their table.]
Ross  Oh here, I think this is us. (Reading the name cards.) Yeah.
Monica  Limited seating my ass. Lets see who made the cut. (To the couple
sitting to her right.) Hi!
The Wedding Guest  Hi!
Monica  Im Monica Gellar. Who do you know the bride and groom?
The Wedding Guest  Oh, I used to work with Frannie.
Monica  Used to work with her. Used to! Im a relative and I didnt
get invited! A blood relative! Blood!!
Ross  (To Monica) Stop saying, "Blood" to strangers.
Monica  (to the couple on her left) So, how about you huh? How do you know the
happy couple?
The Second Guest  We went to college with both of them and now we live
next door.
Monica  Okay, youre fine.
[Scene  Iridium Restaurant, Phoebe and Joey are looking at the menus as the
waiter comes to take their order.]
The Waiter  Hey!
Phoebe  Hey!
The Waiter  Are you guys ready?
Phoebe  Yes! I will have the green salad, umm the house salad, and waters
fine.
The Waiter  Okay.
Phoebe  Okay.
The Waiter  (To Joey) And for you sir?
Joey  Yeah, this slow roasted salmon, just how slow are we talkin here?
The Waiter  Its uh, its already been roasted.
Joey  Ohh, then no. Maybe I should hear those specials again.
Phoebe  Oh Joey, weve heard the specials three times! Okay? Theres
prime rib, mahi mahi, and a very special lobster ravioli. (She grabs his menu and hands it
to the waiter.)
The Waiter  Actually were out of the lobster ravioli. (Putting Joeys
menu under his arm.)
Joey  Oh well, that changes everything! (Grabs his menu and starts looking at it
again. The waiter leaves.) Yknow what Pheebs?
Phoebe  Huh?
Joey  You were right before. I mean, friends are so important.
Phoebe  (checking her watch) Yeah, Im very wise. I know.
Joey  Yknow-yknow what I really want?
Phoebe  What?
Joey  Is to have a long, long talk. Yknow? Get Joey out on the open road
and really open him up.
The Waiter  (returning) Any progress?
Joey  Yes! I will have the lobster ravioli.
Phoebe  God Joey, this is taking forever!
Joey  Whats the rush? What?
Phoebe  W-wI justits thatI haveyknow I
have-I have an appointment. And its very important.
Joey  Whoa-whoa, what is it?
Phoebe  Well Its a date.
Joey  A date?! No, no Pheebs you-you must be mistaken, because I know you
wouldnt schedule a date on the same night you have plans with a friend!
Phoebe  Come on Joey, dont make me feel badly about this.
Joey  No, Im gonna!! Thats right! Yeah, you made me feel really
guilty about goin out with that girl! Like-like-like I did something terrible to
you! And now Pheebs, youre doing the same thing!
Phoebe  ThatIts not the same thing! This is totally
different! This is with David! Remember David, the scientist guy? Okay, hes very
special to me.
Joey  Okay, well my girl from the other night was special. She was a scientist
too!
Phoebe  She was?
Joey  Well, she graduated from high school!
Phoebe  Okay, whatever. Yknow what? I dont have time have time to
convince you because hes only here for four hours, and Im gonna go see him!
(Gets up and leaves.)
Joey  Fine!
Phoebe  Yeah!
Joey  Fine!
Phoebe  Yeah! (She exits.)
Joey  (to the waiter) What are you still doin here?! I told you, lobster
ravioli!
[Scene  Outside Central Perk, Phoebe is running up to meet David.]
Phoebe  Hey!
David  Hey! Oh, I was just about to leave. I-I-I-I didnt think you were
coming.
Phoebe  Oh, I wouldnt miss this.
David  Well, Im very glad youre here. (Kisses her hand.)
Phoebe  Oh, youre such a gentleman. (Grabs his arm.) Come on! Were
going to my place! (Drags him off to her place.)
[Scene  Joey and Rachel's, Rachel is eating the cheesecake and Chandler enters and
catches her in the act.]
Chandler  Are you eating the cheesecake without me?!
Rachel  (with a mouthful) Mm-mmm. (Nods no.)
Chandler  I will give you a hundred dollars to whistle right now. (She tries to
whistle and blows little chunks of cheesecake out of her mouth.) How can you eat the
cheesecake without me?!
Rachel  Oh, what are you going to do?! Are you gonna go run tell Monica?! Are
you gonna tell Joey?! No! Because then you will have to tell them what we did! We are
desert stealers! We are living outside the law!
Chandler  Yknow what? I dont trust you with this cake anymore! And I
got it first, and Im takin it back! (Grabs the cheesecake and heads for his
apartment.)
Rachel  What?! What?!
Chandler  Oh yes!
Rachel  Wait a minute!
Chandler  Oh yes!
Rachel  Oh no-no-no-no-no, no you dont!
Chandler  Oh yes! Oh yes!
Rachel  You think I trust you with it?! No! Were gonna split it! You take
half and I take half!
Chandler  Well thats not fair, youve already had some!
Rachel  What? Oh, well then yknow what? I think Monica would be very
interested to know that you called her cheesecake dry and mealy.
Chandler  What do we use to split it?
Rachel  Okay! (Grabs a knife and cuts it in half.) All right, pick a half.
Chandler  (examining the cake) Okay well, this side looks bigger. Uh
Theres more crust on this side. Yknow? So, maybe if I measured
Rachel  Oh for God sake just pick a piece!
Chandler  All right, Ill pick that one. (Points.)
Rachel  Thats also the smaller piece. (Puts the piece onto a plate.) Okay,
there you go. Enjoy your half my friend, but that is it. No sharing. No switching, and
dont come crying to me if you eat your piece to fast. (As shes saying
that she is backing out the door, when she finishes she turns around to return to her
place, stumbles and drops the cheesecake on the floor.) Oh!!!!
Chandler  (gloatingly and holding his piece) Ohhh!
Rachel  Okay, you gotta give me some of your piece.
Chandler  Oh-ho-ho-ho-no! No! No switching! No sharing, and dont come
crying to me! Ha-ha-ha! I may just sit here and have my cake all day! Just sit here in the
hallway and eat my (Rachel knocks the plate from his hand and it falls on the floor.
That process leaves just the forkful Chandler has, Rachel starts to go after that little
bit and Chandler retreats into his apartment.)
[Scene  Cousin Frannies Wedding Reception, Monica and Ross are sitting at the
table, alone as a woman approaches.]
The Woman 
Ross  Oh, hey Aunt Millie.
Aunt Millie  Isnt it a beautiful wedding?!
Ross  Yes, yes it is. Its uh (Aunt Millie uses this opportunity to
grab Ross and kiss him on the lips. After she leaves Ross quickly wipes his mouth with a
napkin.) Every time on the lips! Why?! Why on lips?!
Monica  Heres Frannie. Hmm, wont she be happy to see me? (Starts to
get up and great Frannie.)
Ross  Now wait a minute, you be nice! All right? I didnt bring you here so
you can ambush her.
Monica  Frannie was the one who found your Playboys and showed them to
mom.
Ross  That bitch! (He gets up and they go over to ambush Frannie. Monica taps on
Frannies shoulder.)
Frannie  (turning around) Monica! What
Monica  Am I doing here? Why? Surprised to see me? Ross brought me. How do you
like that?!
Ross  (to Frannie) Hi Frannie, congratulations.
Monica  You invite my brother, you invite my whole family, and not me?! Why?!
WhatWhy wouldnt you want me at your wedding? What could I have possibly done?!
(Frannies husband walks up.) Stuart!
Frannie  I believe you know my husband.
Ross  So its really a question of who could you have possibly done.
[Scene  Outside Central Perk, David has a cab waiting to take him to the airport and
hes saying goodbye to Phoebe.]
David  Oh, I hate this but I-I-I have to go. I-I cant miss my
flight.
Phoebe  Are you sure? Ill bet theres another flight to Minsk in
like
David  July. Umm, (He speaks Russian.)
Phoebe  Thats really beautiful. What does it mean?
David  Please, clean my beakers. I dont get out of the lab much.
Phoebe  Thats good. I got to admit, I thought it was something else.
David  Yeah, I Well I really actually wanted to say umm, that, but um, I
figured I probably shouldnt because yknow, Ihave to leave.
Phoebe  Youre right! Youre right. Dont say it.
David  I-I do though.
Phoebe  I do too. (They kiss.)
David  Bye Phoebe. (He gets in and the cab drives off. Joey walks up and
witnesses that event.)
Phoebe  (seeing him) Okay, nows not the time Joey. All right? You can yell
at me tomorrow.
Joey  No! No! No Pheebs, Im not gonna yell at you. I just yknow,
started thinking about you and David and Iremember how bummed you were the first
time he left. And I just Oh Pheebs, come here. (He hugs her.) Are you okay?
Phoebe  No Im not okay. The only guy Ive ever been crazy about has
gone to Minsk and I may neverI may never see him again. (Crying.)
Joey  Hey, yknow you could always visit him.
Phoebe  Oh right, like theyre gonna let me have a passport.
Joey  Anything I can do? Whatever you need.
Phoebe  WellButNow, if-if you can achieve positronic distillation of
sub-atomic particles yknow before he does, then he can come back. (They hug again.)
Joey  I can give it a shot.
[Scene  The Hallway, Chandler and Rachel are on their knees with forks trying to
salvage what they can of the cheesecake off of the floor.]
Rachel  Oh! Yay! Look! Theres a piece that doesnt have floor on it!
Chandler  Stick to your side!
Rachel  Hey, come on now!
Joey  (pulls out a fork) All right, what are we havin? (Starts digging
in.)
[Scene  Cousin Frannies Wedding Reception, Ross and Monica are at the door and
about to leave.]
Monica  Oh wait I forgot my wrap.
Ross  What? Oh, okay. Wait here. (Goes to get it, but before he gets there Aunt
Millie sits down on it forcing him to pull it out from behind her which gets her
attention.)
Aunt Millie  Hi sweetie! Are you leaving?
Ross  Well
Aunt Millie  Give us a kiss. Come on! Come on!
Ross  Why?! Why on the lips?! (He wipes his mouth on Monicas wrap and
walks off, leaving Aunt Millie stunned.)
[Scene  The Buildings Roof, the entire gang plus Tag are there to look for a
comet. Theyre looking for a comet on a roof of a New York apartment building. Yeah,
thats realistic. You might as well look for the moon on a bright sunny day.]
Monica  (looking up) Ross, whens this comet thing start?
Ross  Well, technically it seven billion years ago (Well,
technically youd be able to see it for days, well nights; that is if you could see
it with all of the bright lights of New York.)
All  (groaning) Oh no! Oh no! (They all start to get up a leave.)
Ross  Okay! Okay! Fine, Ill stop! No teaching, okay? Well just watch
the pretty light streaking across the sky. (Comets dont streak across the sky,
meteors do.) Okay? Whos official name is Bapstein-King.
All  Okay! Okay! (They start to leave again.)
Phoebe  (looking up) There it is! Oh, look at that! Isnt Mother Nature
amazing?
Chandler  (looking up with her) Thats a plane!
Phoebe  Well, all right. 1700 bags of peanuts flying that high, thats
pretty amazing too.
Tag  Hey, I wonder if you can see my apartment from up here.
Rachel  No. No, you cant.
Tag  What?
Rachel  Oh I dont-I dont know.
Ross  Man, look at all those stars! (Yeah, you can see what? Five of them from
the city?) Infinite space. It really, really makes you wonder, doesnt it?
Joey  (looking through his binoculars at a nearby building) Yknow what
else makes you wonder?
Ross  Huh?
Joey  Check out the rack on this chick! (Turns around to point it out to Ross
and finds that Ross is glaring at him. So he quickly puts his binoculars to his eyes and
starts looking for the comet.)
[Scene  The Roof, continued from earlier.]
Monica  Okay, weve been out here for two hours and we havent seen
any stupid comets. Can we go now? I mean, Chandlers getting chilly. (She walks over
to where Chandler is bundled up in a big coat and shivering.)
Chandler  (with a quivering voice) No, Im not!
Joey  Then why are you wearing Monicas jacket?
Chandler  Because its flattering! (Shivers harder) Come on Monica! Come on
Monica! (He goes inside.)
Rachel  Yeah actually, I think were gonna take off too. We rented a movie.
Phoebe  Oh! I wont say, no to a movie!
Rachel  Uh Pheebs, we just actually kinda wanted to be alone.
Phoebe  Shh! Get me out of here.
Rachel  Oh. (They leave, leaving just Joey and Ross.)
Joey  (whispering) Ross!
Ross  What?
Joey  Come here, check this out!
Ross  What? Is it the comet? (Runs over to where Joeys standing.)
Joey  No! No-no. Look, theres a bug stuck in tar right here. (Bends down
to get a closer look.)
Ross  Joey comeI cant believeI bring you here to see the
Bapstein-King comet, one of natures most spectacular phenomenon, and all you care
about are bugs stuck in tar and-and some woman!
Joey  (standing up) Yknow, theres two women dude.
Ross  Show me where?
Joey  Right-right up here. (Starts looking at them through a piece of pipe.)
Ross  (noticing the pipe and looking at the door) Joey wheres the pipe
that was holding the door open?
Joey  (annoyed) I dont know! (Goes back to looking through the pipe.)
(Pause) Yeah, I do.
Ross  Joey!
Joey  What?! All rightHey! Dont look at me! Youre the one who
wanted to come up and look for some stupid Burger King comet!
Ross  Its called the Bapstein-King comet, okay? (Joey starts to groan.)
Hey! Hey! Bapstein was a very well respected astronomer!
Joey  (covering his ears and yelling) Oh no! No! No! (He starts banging on the
door.)
[Scene  Monica and Chandlers bedroom, Monica is sleeping and Chandlers
sitting in bed, wide awake.]
Chandler  (whispering) Monica!
Monica  Shes sleeping.
Chandler  I know, just quick-quick question, quick question. Which one was Deep
Impact and which one was Armageddon?
Monica  Deep Impact was the one with Robert Duval, Armageddon is
whats going to happen to you if you wake me up.
Chandler  Sorry, I justcant sleep. Ooh! (Turns on the light and
Monica groans.) Where is that book that you are reading with the two women who were
ice-skating and wearing, wearing those hats with the flowers on it? Because every time I
look at that cover Im like(Fake snores.)
Monica  It is in the living room where there is also a light! And no one will
kick you in the shin.
Chandler  What?! (Monica kicks him in the shin.) Ow! (He gets out of bed and
heads into the living room.)
[Scene  Phoebe's apartment, there is a beeping noise coming from the living room and
Phoebe sleepily goes to investigate.]
Phoebe  (crossing her fingers and closing her eyes) Please dont be a space
ship. Please dont be a space ship. (She turns on the light and looks around and
finds that its the smoke detector thats beeping.) Oh thank God! (She moves a
chair over and starts to investigate how to make the beeping turn off, in frustration she
yanks the thing off of the wall. She sets it down and heads for bed, just as she gets
there it beeps again. She opens the cover and removes the battery, but it still beeps.)
How could you be beeping?! I just disconnected you! I took out your battery! How can
Smoke Detector 
Phoebe  Dont interrupt me!!
[Scene  The Roof, Ross and Joey are banging on the door.]
Ross  Rachel!! Monica!!
Joey  Come on!
Ross  I cant believe this!!
Joey  All right well, yknowI guess we know what we have to do to get
down.
Ross  (standing at the edge of the roof) Yeah, I guess we dont have a
choice. (Screaming to the street) Help us! Please help us! Were stuck up on the roof
and we cant get down!!!
Joey  Ross. I was thinking we could just go down the fire escape. (Points it
out.)
Ross  (To Joey) I know, I wasnt finished. (Joey motions him to finish.)
(Yelling at the street) But dont worry! Were gonna go down the fire escape!!
[Scene  Monica and Chandler's kitchen, Chandler has a jug of milk in his hands and
decides to make some warm milk. He opens up the cabinet to get a pot and manages to knock
several other pots onto the floor making a lot of noise.]
Chandler  Shhhhhhhhh!!! (Monica enters) Im sorry, I thought maybe Id
make some warm milk and it would help me sleep.
Monica  With a wok? (Chandlers holding a wok.) I thought you were going to
read my boring book to put you asleep.
Chandler  It got interesting! Damn you Oprah!
Monica  Here, let me make the milk, Im up anyway.
Chandler  Hey, yknow what we can do? Yknow, now that we are up? We
can just like talk to each other all night long, yknow like we did when we were
first going out. Itd be fun!
Monica  Okay that does sound like fun.
Chandler  Okay, so how bummed were you when the second sister died huh?
Monica  The second sister dies?!
Chandler  (Pause) No. No, I-I was, I was talking about the book I was reading.
Monica  The second sister dies in Archie and Jughead Double Digest?
Chandler  Thats correct.
[Scene  Joey and Rachel's, Rachel and Tag are making out on the couch.]
Rachel  You wanna go in the bedroom? Its a little more comfortable.
Tag  Sure.
Rachel  Okay. (They start to head for the bedroom) Oh wait! Umm, did you send
those contracts to Milan?
Tag  If this is your idea of sexy talk? (Shakes his head that its not
working.)
Rachel  No seriously, yknow the contracts I gave you, did you overnight
them?
Tag  What contracts?
Rachel  Okay please tell me that this is just one of your jokes that you do that
I dont get.
Tag  Like what?
Rachel  Yknow, like the thing when you put the phone in your pants? (He
starts laughing.) Tag! Im serious! This isnt funny! Those contracts absolutely
had to go out today!
Tag  Rach, Im sorry, but you didnt give me any contracts!
Rachel  Yes I did! And I put a little Post-It on it that said, "Must
go out today," and underlined today three times and, and then I put a little heart in
the corner because I didnt want to seem to bossy.
Tag  Im telling you, you never gave them to me.
Rachel  Yknow what Tag, if we went down to the office you would see those
contracts sitting on your desk.
Tag  No, I would see you looking embarrassed because they are not on my
desk!
Rachel  Or maybe you would see me looking embarrassed because you are talking on
the phone with your crotch!
Tag  You wanna go down to the office right now?
Rachel  No! Come on its late, were not gonna go down to the office.
Tag  Okay I understand. (Sits down.) I wouldnt want to be proved wrong
either.
Rachel  Okay get your coat! (They get their coats and start to leave. Rachel
suddenly stops and sticks the hand up the back of her shirt.) Oh! When did you unhook
this? (Her bra.) Nice work!
[Scene  The Fire Escape, Joey and Ross have reached the last landing. Joey is tugging
on the ladder that extends to the ground, but it wont budge.]
Joey  All right, it wont go down any further. Its stuck.
Ross  Ugh. Well, were just gonna have to jump. (Joey looks at him.) Yeah.
Now, were gonna have to make sure to land to the right of that patch of ice, okay?
Not hit the dumpster on the other side and uh, and try to avoid that-that weird brownish
red stuff in the middle. So, when you get down thereyou go up to the
roof and you let me in.
Joey  Oh whoa-whoa wait a minute! I have to do it?!
Ross  Yeah! Oh yeah, youll be fine! It-itll be uh, just like bungy
jumping. Yknow? But instead of bouncing back up you-you wont.
Joey  What if I smack my head on the concrete?
Ross  Well, Im gonna lie to you Joey, its a possibility.
Joey  (looks at the ground and at Ross) I dont know Ross! I-I tell you
what, lets flip to see who does it, okay? You-you call it in the air, all right?
Ross  Oh, all right. (Joey flips the coin.) Tails! (The coin bounces off of the
landing above them and falls to the ground.) Can you-can you see what it is?
Joey  No.
Ross  Okay. Well, you be careful.
Joey  What? No! No Ross! No-no! Stop! Im not jumping! Okay, look I have an
audition tomorrow and I cant go if I break my leg.
Ross  Well Im jumping! I have a son! Okay? He wont have a father
if-if I die!
Joey  Well all right so, it looks like were even!
[Scene  Phoebe's apartment, Phoebe is still investigating the smoke detector trying to
figure out how to stop the beeping.]
Phoebe  Okay. So, this wire is connected to this wire which plugs into here.
(She points at each as she says it.) Okay so, to get the beeping to stop all I have to
do (She picks up a shoe and proceeds to pummel the smoke detector. She then gets up
and heads to bed, stops, quickly turns around, and is satisfied that the beeping has
stopped.) Well done, Pheebs. (She resumes her trek to bed, but is stopped at the entrance
to the hallway by the now steady and extremely loud tone emanating from the smoke
detector.) (Yelling.) What do you want from me?!!!!!!!
[Scene  Monica and Chandler's bedroom, Monica is entering with a mug.]
Monica  Okay, heres your milk. What do you want to talk about? (She sees
that Chandler has fallen asleep and slams the door loudly to wake him up.)
Chandler  (startled) What? What? What?
Monica  Ohh! Ohhhh! Were you sleeping sweetie? Im sorry. Here. (Hands the
mug of milk to him.)
[Scene  Rachels Outer Office, Tag and her are arriving.]
Tag  Okay! Feel free to look, but Im telling you those contracts are not
on this desk.
Rachel  Oh how can you possibly know? Look at this mess, Tag! I mean,
this is what Im talking about! You have to be organized! Youve got newspapers!
Youve got magazines! You gotOhh! (Finds a picture.) And who is this chippy? A
little young for you Tag, but whatever.
Tag  Its my sister.
Rachel  Okay, very cute braces. Anyway yknow what, the point is
Tag, start looking because you are going to find those contracts on your desk. (She goes
into her office.)
Tag  So when do you imagine you gave them to me? In the morning or in the
afternoon?
Rachel  In the afternoon. Mr. Zelner came into my office after lunch. He put
them on my desk, and then I put a Post-It on it (Looks down onto her desk and finds
the folder with the Post-It on it that contains the contracts she imagined she gave
Tag) that said, "Must go out today." So you just keep looking in there! All
right?
[Scene  Rachels outer office, Tag has finished searching his desk and Rachel
comes out to try to plant the folder on the desk.]
Tag  Its not here.
Rachel  Puzzler. A bit of a puzzle. Why dont you um, check the copy room,
maybe you left the contracts in there?
Tag  How could I have left them in the copy room?
Rachel  I dont know Tag! How can your genitals make phone calls? Okay?
Its not a perfect world! Just go please.
Tag  Fine.
Rachel  Thank you. (He leaves and she proceeds to plant the folder in his bottom
drawer. She then picks up the phone and holds it to her breasts.) Hello? (Hangs up the
phone.) I still dont get it.
[Scene  Monica and Chandler's bedroom, Chandler has his eyes closed, while Monica is
fully awake.]
Monica  Are you still awake?
Chandler  Yeah! You?
Monica  You do know that was me who just said that right? (He doesnt
respond and she turns on the light, waking him.) Hey. As long as were both up
Chandler  (intrigued) Yeah? (Monica nods yes.) I hope youre not thinking
about cleaning the living room.
[Scene  The fire escape, Joey and Ross are still trying to figure out how to get down.]
Joey  Man, Im starving! What the hell was I thinking at dinner?! "Do
you want soup or salad?" Both! Always order both!
Ross  (looking in the window behind them) Yknow, yknow Im
lookin and I dont think anyones home here. I say we just break the
window, crawl through, and-and yknow explain later.
Joey  Yeah? Really? No ones home?
Ross  I dont think so. Hello? (Knocks on the glass, which angers the big,
large, angry dog behind the glass and causes them to jump to the other side of the
landing.) When you get in there (Joey nods his disapproval.)
[Scene  Phoebes apartment building, in desperation she has wrapped up the smoke
detector in a blanket and is going to throw it into the trash chute.]
Phoebe  Okay, this is where you and I part ways. (She drops the blanket into the
chute.) Noisy bitch!
[Scene  Monica and Chandler's bedroom, Chandler is turning on the light to awaken a now
sleeping Monica.]
Monica  What?! What are you doing?!
Chandler  Do you know what just happened?
Monica  Yeah. We-we had sex and then we fell asleep.
Chandler  No. We were in the middle of sexand you fell asleep.
Monica  Nooo! No, thats not true. No, best time ever! Yeah, you rocked me
world! (She turns out the light to go back to sleep.)
Chandler  (turning the light back on) Monica?
Monica  What?!
Chandler  I was giving you some of my best moves, and you missed it. So please
wake up so we can do it right!
Monica  Okay. Okay, Im ready. Come on big fella!
Chandler  Okay.
Monica  Give me the good stuff.
Chandler  Yeah! (Monica falls asleep) No! No! No! Dont fall asleep! Okay,
I am going to make you some coffee. (Monica doesnt move as he gets out of bed and as
hes heading for the door.) And I probably wont spill coffee grounds all over
the kitchen floor.
Monica  Okay, Im up! Im up!
[Scene  Rachels outer office, shes returning with two coffee cups in hand
to find Tag sitting there.]
Rachel  Hi! I got you some coffee. To, uh (She looks for a place to set it
on his messy desk and he clears a spot for her to set it down.) fair enough. So! Do
you got anything for me?
Tag  Still no luck.
Rachel  Oh my God! Did you check your entire desk! Did you check all the
drawers!
Tag  Do you want me to check again?
Rachel  Well yeah, I wish that you would. (He opens the top drawer.) Well, no
its not in there! (Closes it.) How about that drawer? (She points to the bottom one
and he opens it. She doesnt see the folder she planted and bends over to check.)
Tag  Well, its not out here. Is there any chance it could be in your
office?
Rachel  (thinks) Yknow, I dont-I dont know. Let me, let me
check. (As she heads for her office, she stops glances over her should at Tag, looks into
her office, and finds the folder on her desk.)
Tag  (smirking) Any luck?
Rachel  Can I see you in my office for a minute?
Tag  (entering) Yeah? (She holds up the folder) You found them!! (Rachel is not
amused, because shes still going to try to blame him for her mistake like every
good boss.) Yknow what? Im not even going to gloat. Im just
really relived this whole thing is over.
Rachel  You put these on my desk!
Tag  I did not!
Rachel  Oh really? So youre saying they just slid out of your
bottom drawer, crawled across the floor, then jumped on to my desk?! (I think Dogbert
should have a line here.)
Tag  How did you know they were in my bottom drawer?
Rachel  (pause as she realizes her lame attempt to shift the blame has failed) I
am so hot for you right now.
[Scene  Phoebe's apartment, there is someone pounding on the door and Phoebe sleepily
walks over and answers it. As she nears the door, the pounding stops and she can hear the
smoke detectors wail.]
Phoebe  Oh my God! How did you get back here?!
A Disembodied Voice 
Phoebe  (scared) Fire alarm? (She opens the door to reveal a fireman holding the
blanket with the smoke detector.) Oh! Hi, officerfireman, can-can I help you?
The Fireman  We found your fire alarm in the trash chute.
Phoebe  Thats not mine.
The Fireman  Yes it is.
Phoebe  How do you know?
The Fireman  The next time you want to dump a fire alarm in a trash chute,
dont wrap it in a blanket that says, "Property of Phoebe Buffay not
Monica."
Phoebe  Okay do youOkay, do you have a search warrant? Because the last
time I checked this was still America!
The Fireman  Please reattach this, its against the law to disconnect them.
Phoebe  Fine! (She takes the blanket.) But please God; tell me how to stop them
from going off!
The Fireman  Theres a reset button under the plastic cover.
Phoebe  Theres a reset button?! Ugh, thank you! Thank you! (He exits and
she goes to shut it off.) Theres a reset button! My God! Why didnt I see that!
(She takes off the plastic cover and looks for the button.) Reset button, reset button,
where is there a reset button? (Finds it.) Oh here it is! (Picks it up off of the floor.)
Oh! (She presses it hard, but of course it would help if the button was still attached to
the detector. In frustration she presses it so hard it causes pain in her thumb.) Ohh,
God!
[Scene  The fire escape, Joey is now hanging off of the bottom rung of the ladder that
wont move and Ross is watching from above.]
Ross  Okay, do-do you have a good grip?
Joey  Yeah!
Ross  Okay, Im going to start climb down you now.
Joey  All right! Just hurry up!
Ross  Okay. Now-now-now should I climb down your front so were face to
face or-or should I climb down your back so were-were butt to face.
Joey  I think face to face.
Ross  I would say that.
Joey  Face to face, yeah!
Ross  Okay, here I go.
Joey  All right.
Joey  (grunting) Oh my How much do you weigh Ross?!
Ross  I prefer not to answer that right now, Im still carrying a little
holiday weight.
Joey  Yknow, when we talked about face to face, I dont think we
thought it all the way through.
Ross  So what do you want me to do?
Joey  Well, just shimmy down me and drop!
Ross  Hi.
Joey  Hi.
Ross  (looking down) M-maybe I should hang and you can climb down me.
Joey  (angrily) Yeah? Maybe we should talk about that for a little while!
Ross  Its still looks pretty far!
Joey  Its not that far! Just drop!
Ross  Do not rush me!!
Joey  Ross, you should know that my pants are startin to come down and
Im not wearing any underwear!
Ross  Oww!! My ankle! I really hurt my ankle! I think I twisted it when
IOoh, a quarter!
[Scene  Monica and Chandler's bedroom, theyre cuddling.]
Monica  That really was some of your best work.
Chandler  Hm-hmm, I told you! (Looks at the clock) I cant believe that
Ive only got two hours before I call in sick for work.
Monica  I have to be up in seven minutes.
Chandler  Well, youre not gonna believe this, but if you have seven
minutes
Monica  Really?!
Chandler  Do you wanna?
Monica  Okay! You get the vacuum cleaner and Ill get the furniture polish!

[Scene  Joey and Rachel's, Rachel is trying to move Joeys chair and not having
much luck at it as Joey enters.]
Joey  Hey.
Rachel  Hey.
Joey  What are you doing?
Rachel  Well, yknow I was thinking of moving the couch over here.
Joey  (laughs) Why would you want to do that?
Rachel  So that there will be a decent place for me to sit.
Joey  Rach, there is a decent place to
Rachel  And your lap does not count! Okay? Come on help me move this.
Joey  No. No. No.
Rachel  No?
Joey  No. Rosita does not move.
Rachel  Im sorry, Rosita? As in
Joey  As in Rosita does not move.
Rachel  Joey, its just a chair! Whats the big deal?
Joey  The big deal is that it is the exact equal distance from the bathroom to
the kitchen and its at the perfect angle so you dont get any glare coming of
off Stevie.
Rachel  Stevie the TV?
Joey  (glaring at her) Is there a problem?
Rachel  No! (Joey sets his beer and bag of chips down and heads into his room.)
Oh what does he know! Come on Rosita, us chichas got to stick together! (She tries pulling
on the back of the chair, until the hinge breaks and the back falls off.) You bitch!
[Scene  Central Perk, Chandler and Ross are on the couch talking. Phoebe is getting
coffee.]
Ross  Hey, yknow whats weird? After you guys get married, when you
introduce me to people youre gonna have to say, "This is my brother-in-law
Ross." Not, "My friend Ross," "brother-in-law Ross." Thats
weird isnt it?
Chandler  Couldnt I just say, "This is Ross?"
Ross  (disappointed) Sure, do whatever you want.
Monica  (entering, carrying a newspaper) Hey Ross! So, I was checking out the
uh, real estate section
Ross  Yeah?
Monica  Look at this. (Hands him the newspaper.)
Ross  Oh, it looks like mom and dads house. Oh, it even has a tree with a
broken limb out front and the uh, the window in the attic isOh my God!!
Phoebe  What? What happened to the window in the attic?!
Monica  I cant believe mom and dad are selling the house!
Ross  I cant believe they-they didnt even tell us!
Phoebe  I cant believe I still dont know what happened to the window
in the attic!
Ross  (on phone) Uh, hello dad! Monica and I just saw the house in the paper!
(Listens) Yes were surprised! (Listens) Who did you leave a message with?
Chandler  (knocking on the window while outside) Sorry! (Runs off.)
[Scene  Joey and Rachel's, Joey is examining the injury to Rosita while Rachel is
apologizing to him.]
Rachel  Joey, Joey I am so sorry.
Joey  I told you not to move it! Rach, how would you feel if say, I wanted to
move you mom, and you said dont, and I did it anyway and her head fell off?
Rachel  Okay, come onJoey, Ill buy you a new one! All right?
Well go down to the store right now and well-well get you a new chair.
Joey  (slowly turning and glaring at her) Shes not even cold yet!
Rachel  But dont you think Rosita wouldve wanted you to move on? I
mean yknow, she did always putyour comfort first.
Joey  Thats true.
Rachel  (grabbing her coat) Okay? You ready?
Joey  Yeah, I (Shuts off the TV.) I dont want Stevie to see her like
this.
[Scene  Monica and Chandler's, Ross and Monica are still going on about the house.]
Ross  I cant believe we have to say goodbye to the house we grew up in.
Man, some-some strangers gonna be living in my room.
Monica  Well, after 15 years of mom and dad keeping it as a shrine to you,
its time the velvet ropes came down.
Ross  They kept your room for a while.
Monica  Oh please! Dad turned my room into a gym 20 minutes after I moved out! I
gotta say, a tanning bed and a stack of Victorias Secret catalogues, not a
gym!
Ross  Come on, you know they love you.
Monica  As much as they love you?
Ross  I was their first born! They thought she was barren! Its not my
fault.
Phoebe  (entering) Hey.
Ross  Hey.
Monica  Hey!
Phoebe  Ugh, I hate this year!
Ross  Whats wrong with this year?
Phoebe  Well okay, its already February and Ive only given two
massages and they were both the worst tippers in the world!
Monica  That was me and Ross.
Phoebe  Oh thats right!
Ross  Hey, yknow if you want to pick up some extra cash? Some friends of
mine made good money doing telemarketing.
Monica  Oh thats a great idea. Youre really good on the phone.
Phoebe  Yeah and yeah, and it would probably be better than the last telephone
job I had. Yknow, I probably wouldnt have to say spank as much. (Monica and
Ross are shocked.)
Ross  What?
Phoebe  Oh yeah, like you never called!
[Scene  The telemarketing office, Phoebe is getting shown to her desk by the
supervisor.]
Supervisor  So basically this is very easy. You read from the script and try to
sell as much toner as you possibly can.
Phoebe  Okay, I can do that! Oh, by the way, I love my office.
Supervisor  (laughs) Why dont we do a trial run.
Phoebe  Oh okay. Umm, all right. (Picks up the phone and starts reading from the
script.) Hi, this is Phoebe from Empire Office Supplies, can I speak to your supply
manager please?
Supervisor  Im the supply manager.
Phoebe  Umm, okay I would like to talk to you about your toner needs.
Supervisor  We dont need any toner.
Phoebe  Oh okay, well Im sorry to bother you. Bye-bye. (Hangs up the
phone.) Yeah youre right, this is easy.
Supervisor  Okay, what was wrong with that call?
Phoebe  Oh well, all rightum, no offense, but you were kind of rude.
Supervisor  Theyre always going to tell you they dont need toner,
but thats okay because whatever they say, you can find the answer to it here in this
script.
Phoebe  Oh.
Supervisor  So, I think youre ready to sell toner, do you have any last
questions?
Phoebe  No. (Pause) Oh wait yes! I do, I do have one question. What is toner?
[Scene  Joey and Rachel's, Chandler is entering.]
Chandler  Joey! Joe! (Sees that hes not here and starts investigating. He
picks up the bag of chips.) Full bag. (He picks up the beer.) Beers still cold.
Something terrible mustve happened here! (He decides its not that
important; sits down on Rosita, and the back falls off causing him to flip over.) Oh
no-no-no-no-no-no! (Runs over to Stevie.) Stevie, I was never here! (Runs out.)
[Scene  Ross and Monicas parents garage, Ross and Monica are arriving to go
through their things. Mr. Geller is in the garage.]
Ross  Dad?
Mr. Geller  Im here!
Ross  (entering with Monica) Hey!
Mr. Geller  Hi. God, it seems like just yesterday you guys used to come out to
watch me work.
Ross  Dad, we-we cant believe youre selling the house.
Mr. Geller  Well, its time for a new family to start their memories here
and hopefully their check will clear before they find the crack in the foundation and the
asbestos in the ceiling.
Ross  (To Monica) Lets grab our stuff and get the hell out of here.
Mr. Geller  Im sorry we cant store your childhood things anymore.
Monica  Oh, thats okay, I cant wait to see everything again! All of
the memories
Mr. Geller  Well, I dont know whats in the boxes down here, but I do
know there are six or seven Easy Bake Ovens in the attic.
Monica  I used to love to play restaurant.
Ross  Yeah, not as much as you used to love to play uncooked batter eater.
Monica  Hey, it is unreasonable to expect a child to wait for a light
bulb to cook brownies! (She goes to the attic.)
Mr. Geller  So, I think youre boxes are over here. (They walk over to
them.)
Ross  Wow! Great! (Finds a pack of cigarettes.) Wait, dad who-whos
cigarettes are these?
Mr. Geller  I dont know. They-they must be your mothers, but please,
please dont ask her. Ill throw these away. (He puts them in his pocket as Ross
finds something of interest in one of his boxes.)
Ross  Cool! Dad! My report cards! Hey, check this out dad, (reading his grades)
Math, A. Science, A. History, A. Gym(He puts it away and finds something else.)
Oooh, my rock polisher!
Mr. Geller  Oh look, look theres your old makeup kit!
Ross  Its a clown kit! Clown kit!
Mr. Geller  Well, the white seems to be untouched. (He throws it back into the
box as Mr. Geller moves a tarp and makes a discovery.) Uh-oh.
Ross  What?
Mr. Geller  Yknow how the garage floods every Spring?
Ross  How are you ever going to sell this place?
Mr. Geller  I think I accidentally used Monicas boxes to keep the water
away from the Porsche.
Ross  Oh no. Dad! Dad! What(He goes to open one of her boxes and it rips
apart.) Oh Godeverythings ruined! Dad, shes gonna be crushed!
Mr. Geller  You dont secretly smoke do you?
Ross  No!
Mr. Geller  So its just your mother then.
[Scene  The telemarketing office, Phoebe is hard at work.]
Phoebe  (on phone) Hi, this Phoebe from Empire Office Supplies, can I speak to
your supply manager please? (Listens) Earl, thanks. (Listens) Hi Earl, this is Phoebe from
Empire Office Supplies Id like to talk to you about your toner needs. (Shes
reading from the script.)
Earl  I dont need any toner.
Phoebe  Im hearing what youre saying, but at our prices everyone
needs toner.
Earl  Not me.
Phoebe  May I ask why?
Earl  You wanna know why. You wanna know why?
Phoebe  I surely do!
Earl  Okay, I dont need any toner because Im going to kill myself.
Phoebe  (doesnt have any luck) Umm, is-is that because youre out of
toner?
[Scene  The telemarketing office, Phoebe is still talking to Earl.]
Earl  Okay, sono toner today. Thanks anyway, bye-bye.
Phoebe  No-no wait-wait! I cant just let you hang up! Just please talk to
me.
Phoebe  Yeah! Now, why do you want to kill yourself?
Earl  Its just that I uh, have been working for ten years now at this
meaningless, dead-end job and nobody here even knows I exist!
Phoebe  Chandler?
Earl  I-Im sorry?
Phoebe  No look, I-Im sure that people know you exist!
Earl  Oh yeah? I work in a cubicle surrounded by people. Ive been talking
to you for five minutes now about killing myself and no ones even looked up from
their desk. Hang-hang on. (To the people standing around his cubicle.) Hey everybody! Uh,
Im gonna kill myself! (Theres no response; no one even looks up.) Ill
get back to ya. (To Phoebe) I got nothing. Wait. (He sets the phone down.) Uh, hey Marge!
(Mimes putting a gun to his head, pulling the trigger, and splattering his brain on the
wall behind him. Then points to himself. Marge watches this, then goes back to work.) (To
Phoebe) Ehh, nothing. Nothing.
[Scene  Joey and Rachel's, Chandler has replaced Rosita with his chair.]
Chandler  My chair. Now, if anybody asks, your name is Rosita! (He runs out the
door, grabs the back of Rosita, and we can hear Joey and Rachel talking as they are coming
up the stairs. Neither of them have reached the landing yet.)
Rachel  You will like it!
Joey  No I wont.
Rachel  You dont even know!
Joey  Because, I know what I like and what I dont like! Its not the
same thing!
Rachel  Well look, if you dont like this(The audiences
laughter at Chandlers progress cuts out the rest of Rachels line.)
Joey  I dont know why you say that so soon.
Rachel  Come on Joey, I just bought you a new chair! The most expensive one in
the store! Hey, yknow what I was thinking? We could name her Francette.
Joey  Francette? What is she? A couch?
Joey  Poor thing. Cut down in her prime.
Rachel  Joey, the new chair will be here in an hour. Maybe we should actually
move Rosita out of here. Yknow, start the heeling process?
Joey  Well, I guess youre right. Maybe, maybe Ill take her down to
the incinerator. Its gonna be so said, and kinda cool. (He goes to remove the back,
but it doesnt come off. So he sits down in it, puts his feet up, stands up, and
looks back at it.) Shes heeled!
Rachel  Thats weird.
Joey  No its not weird, its a miracle!
Rachel  Its not a miracle Joey! Im sure theres some
explanation.
Joey  Oh there is! If you want something enough and your heart is pure, wondrous
things can happen!
Rachel  Joey, I really dont
Joey  (interrupting her) Can you tell me how this happened?
Rachel  Well no.
Joey  Miracle!
Rachel  No, yknow what? Maybe somebody came in here and fixed it! Or
something!
Joey  Someone like anangel?
Rachel  Thats right Joey, the chair angel came in and heeled your chair.
(She sits down in the chair.)
Joey  (angrily) Get your non-believer ass outta my chair! (She gets up and heads
for her room.)
[Scene  The Gellers Garage, continued from earlier. Ross and Mr. Geller are still
deciding what to do.]
Mr. Geller  Well, shell understand right? Its not like I did it on
purpose.
Ross  Dad that wont matter to her. Look, all my stuff is safe and dry and
all her is-is, is growing new stuff! See, this is exactly the kind of thing that makes her
think you guys love me more than you love her.
Mr. Geller  Oh my God, does she really thinks that?
Ross  Well, can you blame her?
Mr. Geller  Well I dont know, I-I suppose we may have favored you
unconsciously, you were a medical marvel! The doctor said your mother could
Ross  Dad, dad I dont want to hear about it.
Mr. Geller  Really?
Ross  Well, not right now. Okay look, Monica came here for some memories and
damnit, were gonna give her some! Okay, grabgrab some empty boxes. Okay?
Well-well take stuff from mine and whatever we can pass off as hers
well-well put em in their.
Mr. Geller  Great!
Ross  Like uh yknow like this! This! (He picks up one of those art
projects that kids make in kindergarten and first grade.) She-she couldve made this!
Mr. Geller  Sure!
Ross  Right? And this! (He picks up a trophy) She-she couldve won this!
Mr. Geller  (grabbing a glove) This couldve been hers!
Ross  Sure! Ooh-ooh, what about this?
Mr. Geller  Your make-up kit? Id feel better.
[Scene  Joey and Rachel's, Joey is sitting the now heeled Rosita as Rachel is sitting
in the newly arrived Francette. Francette is one of those new chairs from La-Z-Boy
that has and does everything except cook and go to the bathroom for you. Its got a
small refrigerator under one armrest it has phone jacks for the Internet and regular
phone, and so much more.]
Rachel  (grabbing a beer out of the chairs fridge) I am so psyched I kept
this chair for myself!
Joey  Yeah, me too. (He flips up his armrest in disgust.)
Rachel  Hey, howshows the uh, miracle chair?
Joey  Fine.
Rachel  Yeah? Wow! Yknow, that this thing has speakers in the headrest!
Joey  No. Really?
Rachel  Yeah! You can hook it up to your TV and you get radio!
Joey  (quietly) My chair heels itself.
[Scene  The telemarketing office, Phoebe is still trying to talk Earl out of suicide.]
Phoebe  Earl, youre not hearing me! All Im saying is that
youre not alone all right? Everybody hates the people they work with! (One of her
coworkers overhears that, and she mimes that she didnt mean him.)
Guy  (walking past Earls desk) Hey guy!
Phoebe  Wait, what was that? That sounded like someone being nice to you.
Earl  No! Thats just the "Hey Guy" guy. He says that to
everybody! Hes the worst! Id like to take him with me!
Phoebe  All right so Earl, lets just forget about the people at the
office, okay? There-theres gotta be someone else in your life worth sticking around
for! What about-what about your family, your friends, or maybe your girlfriend?
Earl  (laughs) Yeah! Right!
Phoebe  Oh sorry, boyfriend!
Earl  Oh no.
Phoebe  No, whatever! Anything!
The "Hey Guy" Guy  Hey guy!
Phoebe  Yeah, hes gotta go.
Earl  Okay, I should, I should probably be getting back to my thing now. See ya.
(Hangs up.)
Phoebe  No! Im not finished yet! Dont! Dont you dare hang up
on me!!!
Supervisor  (walking by and overhearing that) (to the rest of the staff) The new
girls good.
[Scene  The Gellers Garage, Mr. Geller and Ross are finishing up recreating
Monicas memories as Monica enters.]
Monica  Hey guys! Hey!
Ross  Hey.
Monica  Hey, I just whipped us up some Easy Bake treats, they should be
ready in about three days.
Mr. Geller  (overacting) Thats a good one! Do you hear that Ross? Three
days!
Ross  (overacting as well) Yeah! Yeah! (Laughs.) Oh, this will make a great
memory.
Monica  (wary) Okay. So, which boxes are mine?
Ross  Well, these. These are yours right here. (Pointing to the boxes they just
created for her.)
Monica  Okay. (Starting to go through them) Oh! A coloring book! (Holding it
up.)
Ross  Yeah. Yeah, oh you loved that thing. You always had it with you. You never
went anywhere without-without that coloring book.
Monica  (looking through it) Really? Wow! It looks like I had some trouble
staying inside the lines.
Ross  Nu-uh! (Grabs it and examines it.)
Monica  (holding up a glove) Oh, an old glove?
Mr. Geller  Oh, yeah you loved that glove! You took it every place you went. You
never went any place without that glove.
Ross  Oh, I dont know how that got in there.
Monica  (holding up a small cowboy hat) This isnt mine. (Sets it down and
looks at the rest of the boxes.) Hey, this isnt, this isnt my stuff! Ugh,
Ross! (Grabs and holds up a doll.) These are your boxes! Where are my boxes?
Ross  Umm, your boxes are umm
Monica  What?
Ross  Dad?
Mr. Geller  Well, the garage flooded sweetie and it ruined everything in your
boxes. Im sorry.
Monica  Just mine?
Mr. Geller  Im afraid so.
Monica  So why-why wasnt Rosss stuff ruined? (Pause) And if you say
the words medical marvel Im going to Easy Bake your head!
Mr. Geller  Well, I used your boxes to divert water away from the Porsche.
Monica  So wait, Rosss stuff is fine, but I have no memories because you
wanted to keep the bottom two inches of your car away from water!!!
Mr. Geller  There was also leaves and guk and stuff.
Monica  I cant believe this! (Storms out.)
Mr. Geller  (To Ross) Screw it! Im having one. (Takes out and lights a
cigarette.)
[Scene  Monica and Chandler's, Chandler is writing a letter by the bay window as Rachel
enters.]
Rachel  Hey Chandler!
Chandler  Hey!
Rachel  How would you like to sit in a chair that fully reclines, has a rolling
massage, and speakers in the head rest?
Chandler  Yeah, Id love to but Ive tried that so many times they
wont even let me in the store anymore.
Rachel  Well what if I told you, you can do it in my apartment?
Chandler  (excitedly) Are you telling me that you bought the chair that is
making all other lounge systems obsolete? The chair that Sit magazine called the Chair of
the Year?
Rachel  I just purchased the La-Z-Boy E-cliner 3000. (Which is an actual
product by the way, Im not sure about the 3000 part.)
Chandler  Thats awesome! Thats great! What made you do it?!
Rachel  Well, its a long story, but umm I broke Joeys chair
Chandler  Whoa-whoa-whoa! You broke Joeys chair?
Rachel  Yeah.
Chandler  I thought I broke Joeys chair! Thats why I replaced
it with mine!
Rachel  Ohhhhh. Thats how it got fixed!
Chandler  Well, what did you think, that-that elves came in and fixed it?
Rachel  Noo! (Laughs) Angels.
Chandler  Im gettin my chair back! (Heads for Joey and
Rachels.)
Rachel  What? Wh-hey!
Joey  Well, it looks like it wasnt heeled after all! Yeah! So, I guess
this chair is mine now! (Sits down in it and groans.)
Chandler  Joey you broke my chair!!
Joey  Your chair?!
Rachel  Yeah, he thought he broke your chair so he switched the chairs!
Joey  So, there was no miracle?!
Rachel  No Joe, no miracle.
Joey  (sarcastic) Oh no this is devastating! My faith is shaken. Im so
glad I have the new chair to get my through this difficult time in my life.
Rachel  Uh-huh! Nice try, but you dont get that chair anymore! All right?
That is my chair now! You can sit on my lap! (Joey starts to get up.) No I take that back!
Chandler  I think I should get the chair!
Joey  How do you figure?
Chandler  Because you (Points to Joey) broke a chair and you (Points to
Rachel) broke a chair! The only one around here that hasnt broke a chair, is me!
Rachel  No-no-no! This chairs not going anywhere.
Chandler  Well, wheres the logic in that?!
Rachel  The logic is, that there are two of us and we are both strong enough to
break a chair in half!
Chandler  So Joey breaks my chair and I get nothing!
Joey  Thats right!
Chandler  What are you guys? Like a gang or something?!
Joey  Yeah! We are!
Rachel  Were the Cobras!
[Scene  Earls Office, Earl has his head in his hands as Phoebe enters.]
Phoebe  (to Marge) Excuse me! Can you tell me where I can find Earl? Hes
the supply manager around here.
Marge  Sorry, I dont know any Earl.
Earl  (screaming) Im right here!!!!
Phoebe  (goes over to his desk) Earl! Im Phoebe.
Earl  Phoebe? The lady who sells toner?
Phoebe  Umm, look it, you-you cant kill yourself.
Earl  (exhales) Look, um I really appreciate your coming down
Phoebe  No-no I cant! I cant let you do it!
Earl  Why?!
Phoebe  Because it was fate that made me call you today!
Earl  I thought it was toner.
Phoebe  No! Think about it okay? This isnt even my regular job!
Okay? And my first day on the job, youre my first call! And-and somebody else
mightve hung up on you, but I wouldnt do that because I know about this stuff.
My mom killed herself.
Earl  Really?!
Phoebe  Yes.
Earl  How?
Phoebe  Im not gonna give you tips! Look dont you see that
this-thisthis all came together so that I could stop you from doing this.
Earl  Couldnt it just be a coincidence?
Phoebe  No, its fate!
Earl  It doesnt really seem like enough to be fate.
Phoebe  Oh. Well umm, okay heres a weird thing. My mother was also a
supply manager.
Earl  Im actually the office manager.
Phoebe  Oh my God! So was she! And! Get this, okay? Your-your name is Earl,
right? Her name was Pearl, P-Earl.
Earl  Well, was there anything else?!
Phoebe  Sure! (Thinks.) Umm, where are you from?
Earl  Philadelphia.
Phoebe  Oh my God! So was she! Oh, Ive got-Ive got goose bumps. (She
holds out her arm.)
Earl  (inspecting it) Really?
Phoebe  Well, yknow Im wearing layers and its warm.
Earl  Yeah-yeah.
Phoebe  But ifno look, okay. These jerks might not care about you, but the
universe does! And that says a lot!
Earl  (To All) Did you hear that?! I dont need you guys to care about me!
Because the universe cares! The whole universe! (Laughs as everyone ignores him.) (To
Phoebe) I really wished theyd care just a little bit though.
Phoebe  Yknow, I dont-I dont think its you. This is a
freaky place. (To All) Hey! Guys! (Everyone looks up.) (To Earl) Oh no, its you.
Earl  Yeah.
[Scene  The Gellers Garage, Monica is picking through her ruined childhood
heirlooms with Ross.]
Monica  Oh, this terrible! Everything is destroyed! Look at this. (She
picks up some kind of furry thing.) It obviously meant enough for me to save it, and I
dont even know what it is! Ohh, its still soft. (She rubs it against her
cheek.) What do you think this is?
Ross  All right. I think it was a mouse.
Mr. Geller  (entering) How are you honey?
Monica  How do you think I am?! Youve wrecked all my childhood memories.
You love Ross more than me. And I just rubbed a dead mouse on my face!
Mr. Geller  Sweetheart, we love you just as much as Ross! Now, Im sorry
about everything that happened and Id probably never be able to make it up to you,
but heres a start. (He hands her a small box.)
Monica  (opening it) Whats this?
Mr. Geller  Its the key to my Porsche. Well, the key to your Porsche.
Monica  (shocked) What?!
Ross  (even more shocked) What?!!!
Mr. Geller  Ive been thinking about getting rid of it. I was driving it
the other day and saw my reflection in a store window. Your mothers right, I do
look like an ass.
Monica  Wait, youre giving me your Porsche, youre kidding me
right?!
Ross  Well w-w-w-w-wait, w-wait, wait, wait a minute! I mean a couple of stupid
boxes get wet and she gets a Porsche?!
Mr. Geller  (To Monica) Why dont we take it for a spin?
Monica  All right!
Ross  Well, what about me?! Im a medical marvel!!
[Scene  Joey and Rachel's, Rachel is sitting in Joeys lap on Francette, and
theyre both groaning.]
Joey  Oh yeah.
Rachel  Ahhhh.
Joey  Ahhh (To Rachel) Eh?
Rachel  Uh-huh.
Monica  (entering) Hey guys!
Rachel  Hey!
Joey  Hey!
Monica  Do you guys know what happened to Chandlers barca lounger?
Rachel  Oh yeah, Joey broke it. Had to get rid of it.
Monica  Are you kidding?! I get a Porsche and the barca loungers
gone?! This is the best day ever! (Runs out.)

[Scene  Joey and Rachel's, Joey is knocking on Rachels door, whose door frame is
decorated with balloons. The rest of the gang is there as well. Rachel opens the door and
the gang blow on noisemakers.]
Ross  Happy birthday!!!
Monica  Happy birthday!!!
All  Rach! Come on! Rach!
Monica  Its your birthday!
Tag  (entering from her room) Hey.
Chandler  (To Monica) Shes not as pretty as she was when she was 29.
Tag  Ms. Green would like to establish some ground rules before she comes out.
She would appreciate it if you dont use the words old or downhill or (To Joey) they
still look pretty damn good. (Joey smiles and everyone glares at him.)
Joey  They do!
Phoebe  Rachel! Come on out! Monica made breakfast!
Monica  Chocolate-chip pancakes!
Ross  Weve got presents!
Rachel  Good ones?
Monica  They all came from the list you handed out to us two weeks ago.
Rachel  Well, can I keep the presents and still be 29?
Joey  Come on Rach! Look, turning thirty is not that big a deal.
Ross  Oh really. Is that how you felt when you turned thirty?
Joey  (screaming) Why God?!! Why?!! We had a deal!! Let the others grow old! Not
me!! (He buries his head in Phoebes lap for comfort.)
Rachel  Yknow, Im still 29 in Guam.
Ross  Hey, 30 is not that old! Do you know how old the Earth is?
Rachel  Late thirties? Oh come on you guys! Is it just me? Am I overreacting to
this?
Chandler  No Rach, its not just you. My thirtieth birthday certainly
wasnt that much fun.
Joey  (screaming) And now Chandler! Were all gettin so old! (Looking
up) Why are you doing this to us?! (Turns away crying.)
[Scene  Joey and Rachel's, breakfast is finished but Rachels still down.]
Monica  Rach, youre in a great place in your life. Come on, youve
got a great job! Good friends
Joey  Yeah, youre roommate is a soap opera star.
Rachel  Look, yknow I know my lifes going pretty well, but I look
around and I just see so many people whove accomplished so many other goals by the
time theyre thirty.
Phoebe  Yeah, but you shouldnt compare yourself to me.
[Flashback to  The Street in front of Central Perk, Ross and Joey are holding a yellow
tape across the road and everyone is cheering Phoebe as she bounces around the corner on a
hippity-hop.]
All  Come on Phoebe! You can do it Phoebe! Come on!
Rachel  There you go!
Phoebe  I did it! One mile on a hippity-hop! Thats it!! Thats
everything I wanted to do before I was thirty. Oh, except I wanted to patch things up with
my sister. But oh well. Yay!! (They all cheer again.) And-and girls this thing is a
Godsend if you know what I mean. (Rachel and Monica look intrigued and as they all head
into Central Perk, Rachel picks up the hippity-hop that Phoebe left behind.)
[Scene  Joey and Rachel's, continued from earlier.]
Rachel  Thirty. Ugh, I mean thirty! Monica, do you remember mean, old Mrs.
Kreeger in the fifth grade? She was thirty!
Tag  Come on, lets have some fun. Huh? (To Rachel) What do you want to do
today?
Rachel  Nothing. I dont want to do anything.
Monica  Well, doing nothing on your thirtieth is better than doing something
stupid, like Ross.
Ross  Hey! That was a practical purchase! I needed that car for transportation!
Okay? I-I have a child!
[Flashback to  A street, Ross is sitting in his newly purchased MGB. Which is
one of the better British sports cars ever made. Of course, better is a
relative term. Which reminds me of a joke. Why dont the British make computers?
Because they couldnt figure out how to make them leak oil. Anyway, the gang is all
staring at his new purchase.]
Ross  How hot do I look in this, huh?!
Chandler  Ross, a sports car? Wouldnt it have been cheaper to just stuff a
sock down there?
Ross  Thats not what this is about okay? I-I am a sports car enthusiast. I
have always been into cars.
Joey  Hey, whats the horsepower on this thing?
Ross  (giddy) I dont know, but-but look how shiny!
Monica  I cant believe you bought this.
Rachel  Really! God Ross, what were you thinking? (To Phoebe, quietly) I know
its really shallow, but a part of me wants him again.
Phoebe  Oh, well get in line missy. (To Ross) So, can I have a ride stud?
Ross  Hop in. (Phoebe hops in.) Get ready for the smoothest ride of your life.
Ross  Damnit! (Shuts the car off.)
Phoebe  (getting out) Okay, whos next?
[Scene  Joey and Rachel's, Phoebe is pouring Rachel some coffee.]
Rachel  Yknow what? I am going to do something today. Im not just
gonna sit around like some old lady. Im gonna get something pierced. Like my uh,
like my nose or my tongue or something.
Phoebe  Really?! Cause yknow that hurts.
Rachel  So what?! Yknow what? The way I see it(Phoebe pulls out a
hair from the back of her head)Ow! Son of a bitch!!
Tag  Look Rachel, I know what youre going through. Im totally
freaked about turning 25.
Rachel  (glares at him) Get out, get out of my apartment.
Monica  All right Rach, for what its worth, I think that youre doing
great. I mean yknow lets face it, no one handles this well.
Phoebe  Least of all you.
Tag  Why? What youd do?
Monica  Werent you asked to leave sonny?
Chandler  (To Joey) Would you put that back on?! Monicas gonna be here any
minute!
Joey  But it hurts my Joeys Apple.
Chandler  (frustrated) Okay, for the last time. Its not named for each
individual man.
Mrs. Geller  (To Chandler) Youve done a wonderful job with this party
Chandler. Everything looks so lovely.
Chandler  Oh well, not as lovely as you. I mean, I cant believe that you
would have a thirty-year-old daughter! (To Mr. Geller) And you! I cant believe that
you would have a tux thats thirty years old! (Puts his hand on Mr. Gellers
shoulder.)
Mr. Geller  Its older than that. Ross was actually conceived right near
this tuxedo.
Chandler  Ohh! (He quickly removes his hand and looks at it.)
Rachel  (entering) Hey! Everybody hide! Hide! I saw her! Shes coming!
Chandler  Okay! Okay! Everybody down! Everybody down! (Rachel turns off the
lights and everyone crouches. As everyone crouches, a ripping noise erupts from the
assemblage.)
Mr. Geller  Crap.
Chandler  (getting up to investigate) Okay, everybody stay here. I will find out
whats going on.
Monica  Heyyy!! You got the door open!! (Giggles.)
Chandler  Hey-hey are you drunk?
Monica  Nooo! (Giggles) Okay. (She tries to pull herself up by Rachel and
Joeys doorknob, but the door opens and she almost falls into the their apartment.
She manages to catch herself.) Whoa! (Stands up, unsteadily) Okay. See I was, I was a
little nervous about turning (whispering) thirty. (Giggles.) So the bus boys took me out
for some drinks. (Pause) I wanna puke on you later!
Chandler  Okay, here is the thing. We have thrown a very formal surprise
party for you in there! All of your friends are in there and your parents!
Monica  Noo!!!
Chandler  Yes!
Monica  Noo!!
Chandler  Yes!!
Monica  Oh no! My parents have never seen me drunk! (Pause) That they know of.
Chandler  Okay, heres the thing. Were gonna get you some coffee and
they will never know that youre drunk.
Monica  Really?! You promise?
Chandler  Yeah, Ill take care of it.
Monica  Okay. I love you so much. (Kisses him.)
Chandler  (laughing) Okay we have to do something about your breath.
Monica  What about your breath?! (Breathes on him.)
Chandler  Thats still yours. Okay, now remember its a surprise
party. So, when you go in, act surprised.
Monica  Okay. I can do that.
Chandler  Okay.
All  Surprise!!!
[Scene  Rosss birthday, Joey is now trying to get his car out while Ross is
directing him.]
Ross  Okay, forward. ForwardStop! (The car moves an inch and Ross runs to
the back of the car.) Okay, backStop! (The car barely moves and Ross runs back to
the front.) Okay, forwardStop! Stop! Stop!
Monica  Ross, just forget about it. This guys got you totally wedged in.
Woman  (To Joey) Is this yours?
Joey  Well actually
Ross  No-no-no! Its mine! Its-its mine. (The woman walks
away.)
Joey  Dude, you soooo need this car.
Phoebe  (running up) Okay. Okay, heres what were gonna do. Okay,
Im gonna break into this mini-van and put it in neutral. You guys push it forward so
Ross can drive out of his spot. Okay? All right, here we go. (She opens her coat and
reveals that thing car thieves use to break into cars as Ross jumps in behind the wheel.
She inserts the device, unlocks the door, opens it, and the alarm goes off.) Haul ass!!!!
(Runs off.)
[Scene  Phoebes birthday, shes taking the hippity-hop to Ursulas
apartment as a gift. She knocks on the door and Ursula answers it.]
Phoebe  Happy thirtieth birthday! Here! (Hands her the hippity-hop.) Its
for the child in you, and the woman. Happy thirtieth!
Ursula  Right, why do you keep saying that?
Phoebe  Because its our thirtieth birthday.
Ursula  Yeah, no were not thirty. Were 31. Okay. (She closes the
door.)
Phoebe  Wait! (Knocks on the door and Ursula opens it.)
Ursula  Oh, its you.
Phoebe  Yeah. What?!
Ursula  Yeah, were not thirty, were 31.
Phoebe  Nu-uh!
Ursula  Yea-huh! Thats what is says on my birth certificate.
Phoebe  You have your birth certificate?
Ursula  Yeah, I got a big box of family stuff when my mom died.
Phoebe  Our mom.
Ursula  (sarcastic) Right! Okay. (Hands Phoebe her births certificate.)
Phoebe  Do you have my birth certificate?
Ursula  No, I sold it to a Swedish runaway.
Phoebe  (reading the certificate) Oh my God! Oh my God, we are 31.
Ursula  Yeah.
Phoebe  I just lost a whole year of my life.
Ursula  (sarcastic) Okay.
Phoebe  Your middle name is Pamela?
Ursula  Yes.
Phoebe  Well, I never knew mine. Do you remember what it is?
Ursula  Yes! Phoebe.
Phoebe  Thats my first name.
Ursula  Right, okay, then no.
[Scene  Monicas birthday, its just after the surprise.]
Chandler  Okay before we start the celebration, Monica has to go put on her
party dress.
Monica  Yay!
Chandler  See? (Does his laugh.) Here we go. (Starts walking her to their room,
and has to pass in front of Mr. Geller whos sitting at the table and Mrs. Geller
whos standing next to him.)
Mr. Geller  Happy birthday, sweetie! Give us a hug! (Starts to get up.)
Mrs. Geller  (stopping him) Dont get up Jack! The safety pins are about to
blow.
Monica  (sees someone) Paul!
Chandler  (correcting her) Phil.
Monica  Phil!
Chandler  Now, there is a dress laid out on your bed. (Monica stumbles on the
steps.) Okay, (catches her) youre doing great. Youre doing great. Youre
doing fine.
Phoebe  Hey, whats going on?
Chandler  Monicas a little drunk.
Phoebe  Yay! I love drunk Monica!
Monica  Awwwww (Giggles.)
Chandler  (To Monica) Go change! (To Phoebe) She doesnt want her parents
to know shes drunk.
Phoebe  Ohh! All right! All right. Heres what well do, Ill get
twice as drunk as Monica and then no ones will even notice her.
Rachel  Whats-whats going on? Phils really pissed!
Chandler  Monicas wasted.
Ross  Maybe that will liven up this party.
Chandler  (To Rachel) Okay, will you just go help her change please!
Rachel  Okay, but taking care of a drunk, naked woman seems like a job for Joey.
Joey  Yep. (Starts for Monicas room, but Chandler stops him.)
[Scene  Rachels birthday, everyone is presenting their presents to Rachel.]
Tag  (handing his to her) This ones from me.
Rachel  Ahh!
Tag  It wasnt on your list, but hopefully youll think its
really fun.
Rachel  (opening it) A scooter! (Shes not happy.)
Ross  (to Tag) Stick to the list. Always stick to the list.
Rachel  No! No-no, I love it. Thank you. (Kisses him.)
Chandler  Okay, open ours next. Open ours next!
Rachel  Okay.
Joey  Now that youre a couple, we dont get two presents from you
guys?
Chandler  For my last birthday you gave me a hug! (To Rachel) Okay, read
the card! Read the card!
Rachel  Okay. (Opens the card and reads it.) Happy birthday Grandma! Its
better to be over the hill (starting to cry) then buried under it. (Breaks down as
everyone glares at them.) All our love Monica and Chandler. (Crying) Thats funny,
yeah!
Chandler  No-no-no-no! That was the joke!
Rachel  (crying) No, I know! I get it! Its funny!
Chandler  No, because youre not a grandmother!
Rachel  No I know, because to be a grandmother you have to be married and have
children and I dont have any of those things. Thats why its so funny.
(Runs into her room crying.)
Monica  All you had to do was buy the card!
[Scene  Rachels birthday, a time lapse has occurred. Rachel is coming back into
the living room carrying a notepad.]
Ross  Hey! Look whos back! Its the birthday girl! Hows the
birthday girl feeling?
Rachel  Well, I feel fine, but I think youre bumming out the rest of the
kids.
Ross  What? (Glances over and sees the faces of the rest of the group, then goes
and sits down.)
Rachel  Okay! Yknow what? I realized it was stupid to get upset about not
having a husband and kids. All I really needed was a plan. See I wanna have three
kids
Phoebe  Oh let me guess, and you wanna have them all at the same time and you
wanna have them for your brother.
Rachel  As I was saying I should probably have the first of the three kids
by the time Im 35 which gives me five years. I love this plan! I wanna marry this
plan!
Phoebe  If you could do that, Id marry the hippity-hop.
Rachel  So, if I wanna have my kid when Im 35, I dont have to get
pregnant until Im 34. Which gives Prada four years to start making maternity
clothes! Oh wait, but I do want to be married for a year before I get pregnant
Monica  Really! That long?! (Chandler slowly turns and looks at her.) (To
Chandler) Look all you want, its happening!
Rachel  No, so I dont have to get married until Im 33! Thats
three years, thats three whole yearsOh, wait a minute though. Ill need a
year and a half to plan the wedding, and Id like to know the guy for a year, year
and a half before we get engaged Which means I need to meet the guy by the time
Im thirty.
Ross  Which is fine! Because you just turned(Removes two candles
from the cake)twenty-eight!
Rachel  No! Ross, no! It is not fine! Eh-eh-according to my plan I should
already be with the guy I wanna marry!
Joey  Will you quit hoggin it!
[Scene  Monicas birthday, Monica is now dressed and is being helped out by
Chandler and Rachel.]
Rachel  (To Chandler) Im telling you its like watching Bambi learn
how to walk.
Ross  (To Monica) Youre drunk! Mom and dad are gonna be maaaaadd! Maybe
Im a little drunk.
Chandler  (to a waiter) Oh thats great! Right there! Can we get some of
that over here please? (The waiter comes over) There we go.
Joey  (to the waiter) Hey! Are those crab cakes? (The waiter nods) Did I not
tell ya to come straight to me when more crab cakes were ready?
Chandler  (To Monica) How are you feeling?
Monica  You are so handsome! I wanna make love to you right here, right
now! (Growls and pulls him into a kiss.)
Ross  I really wish that you wouldnt.
Chandler  (To Monica) Now all you have to do is just get through a little bit
more, okay? Then we can put you in bed, okay? Just smile and dont talk to anyone.
Phoebe  (clinking two glasses together) Speech! Speech! Lets hear from the
birthday girl! Huh?
Chandler  Pheebs!!
Phoebe  Dont you see? Everyones looking at me! The plans
working! I didnt even have to take off my top yet!
Mrs. Geller  Speech! Come on Monica!
Ross  Come on!
All  Come on! Speech!
Mr. Geller  (filming this) Hey Chandler, you cant keep your hands off her
for one second!
Mrs. Geller  Oh-ho, I think its nice.
Chandler  I think its necessary. (Backs away anyhow.)
Monica  I-I-I wanna thank you all for coming. My family and my friends
Phoebe  (screaming) Wooo!! Hoo!!
Monica  I really like to say that Im-um (Pause) Yknow what
Id really like to say? Im drunk!! (Mrs. Geller pulls the camera down.)
Thats right mom and dad your little Harmonica is hammered!! (Ross grabs the camera
out of his dads hands.) And guess what! Ive been drunk before! And Ive
smoked a cigarette! And I got a box of Ding-Dongs hidden in my underwear drawer!
Its all okay. Its okay because I turned thirty today. And, and I can do
anything I want! Because I am a grown up. (Falls over sideways with Ross filming
the fall.)
Phoebe  (To Joey) Okay quick, help me get this off! (Motions to her top.)
Joey  Yeah!!
[Scene  Phoebes birthday, shes telling everyone what she found out at
Ursulas while sitting in Central Perk.]
Phoebe  I lost a whole year! I cant believe it! This is so unfair!
Joey  Oh, I dont know Pheebs. Itll be okay.
Phoebe  Will it? Will it?! I mean, how would you feel if you found out you were
31?
Joey  Thats not gonna happen. No. (Looks up) Because we have a new deal!
Phoebe  Plus, it totally ruined my schedule! II havent done any of
the things I wanted to do by the time I was 31!
Joey  Like what?
Phoebe  Like okay I-I-I, I havent met any Portuguese people! I, I
havent had the perfect kiss! And I havent been to snipers school!
Monica  Phoebe, yknow why dont we just go upstairs and have some
birthday cake?
Phoebe  No, I just feel like being by myself for a while. All right? Ill
see you guys later. Thanks. (Gets up and exits.)
Rachel  Hey. (After she leaves.) Oh, poor Pheebs.
Joey  Hey, yknow what you guys? I think Im gonna go walk her home.
(Gets up and runs out.)
Monica  Oh man!
Chandler  What?
Monica  Hes gonna eat the cake!
Joey  Pheebs! Wait up! (She stops.) Listen uh, close your eyes. (She does so and
Joey passionately kisses her.) Maybe thats one thing you can cross off your list.
Phoebe  Oh yeah.
Joey  Oh, and plus Im 1/16th Portuguese.
Phoebe  Oh! (Phoebe walks away smiling.)
[Scene  Rosss birthday, his car is still trapped in its spot. Now Joey,
Phoebe, and Ross are at the front of the car with Monica, Rachel, and Chandler at the rear
of the car.]
Ross  Okay, is everybody clear? Were gonna pick it upand move it.
Now all we need is teamwork, okay? Were gonna lift the carand slide it
out. Lift and slide!
Rachel  Ross, I really dont think
Ross  (interrupting her) Lift!! And slide!
Chandler  Okay, here we go.
Ross  All right everyone, lift! (They and try to lift the car, of course it
doesnt raise up) And slide!! (Everyone leans over, but the car still does not move.)
[Scene  Rachels birthday, she is coming into the hallway where Joey and Tag are
playing with the scooter.]
Rachel  Hey Joey, can I
Joey  Oh, come on Rach! My turn just started!
Rachel  Actually, I just wanna talk to Tag.
Joey  Oh. Okay. Hey, can I ride this outside?
Rachel  Whatever! Okay, Im not your mother.
Joey  Okay! (Runs off downstairs.)
Rachel  Not in the street!!
Joey  Yes!
Rachel  (to Tag) Hi.
Tag  Hey.
Rachel  Hey.
Tag  How are you doing? Are you feeling any better?
Rachel  Yeah, Im doing okay. Im umlets talk.
Tag  Okay. (They sit on the step.)
Rachel  Umm
Tag  Whats up?
Rachel  Ohh Tag, ummyoure such a great guy and we have sooo much fun
together but I dont-I dont
Tag  Wait! I think I see where youre going, but before you say anything
else, can I just say one more thing? (Kisses her.)
Rachel  Well said. And a uh good example of the fun I was referring to uhh, but
I just think Im past the point where I think I can yknow, just have fun.
Tag  Rachel, dont do this. This is just because youre turning
thirty.
Rachel  Yeah, it is! But youre just a kid! I mean youre 25!
Tag  Twenty-four actually.
Rachel  Oh God! Yknow what I wish? I wish you were six years older. Well
actually, if Im wishin for stuff, I actually wish I was six years younger.
Tag  Me too.
Rachel  Yeah, Im sorry. (They hug.)
Chandler  Hey! Howd it go?
Rachel  Oh, if I only want two kids, can I keep him for another year?
Phoebe  You did the right thing.
Joey  (entering, limping, and holding his arm) I dont like this anymore.
(He sits down with them in pain.)
Chandler  Well, here we are, just a bunch of thirty year olds.
Ross  God, do you realize in ten years were gonna be 40?
Joey  (crying) Why God?! Why are you doing this to us?! (He buries his head in
Rosss shoulder.)
[Scene  Rosss birthday, night has fallen and Joey and Ross are walking by where
his car is parked to find that both cars blocking him in have left.]
Ross  Yes! My babys finally free!
Joey  All-all right! (They run and jump in the car.) Start it up! Lets go!
Ross  (starting it) Woohoo!
The Man In The Sportscar  How hot are we? (He drives off.)
Ross  You wanna buy a car?
Joey  No.

[Scene  Monica and Chandler's, Monica, Chandler, Ross, and Rachel are sitting around
the table.]
Monica  Im glad youre here, we have a couple of things to ask you
about the wedding ceremony.
Rachel  (starting to cry) Ohh
Ross  Whats the matter? You okay?
Rachel  Yeah, its just yknow
Chandler  (To Ross) Monica said wedding.
Monica  Uh, so anyway, we thought one of you could read something during the
ceremony.
Rachel  Oh! I would love to read a poem.
Chandler  Do you think you could get through a poem?
Rachel  (crying) Itll be a short one.
Monica  Okay, so Ross will be doing the reading.
Rachel  Ohhh
Ross  Okay. Yeah, I guess, I guess I could do that too.
Chandler  Too?
Ross  Yeah, I kind of uh, have something else planned for you guys.
Monica  Do you mind telling us what it is?
Ross  Sorry, Im kinda keeping this one on the Q.T.
Chandler  Well, whatever it is, I hope it involves winking. (Winks in a spy-type
manner.)
Joey  (entering, excited) Hey!
All  Hey!
Joey  So I just talked to one of the DOOL writers today, and
Monica  What is DOOL?
Joey  Days Of Our Lives. Anyway, youre not gonna believe it! My
character is coming out of his coma!!
All  Oh!!
Chandler  Thats great!
Joey  And-and-and not only that, Im gettin a new brain!!
Chandler  So great things are happening at work and in your personal
life!
Rachel  Wait, what do you mean youre getting a new brain?
Joey  Oh well, theyre killing off one of the characters on the show, and
when she dies her brain is being transplanted into my body.
Ross  What? A brain transplant?!
Joey  (seriously) Yes, its a highly controversial procedure.
Ross  Its ridiculous!
Joey  Well, I think its ridiculous that you havent had sex in three
and a half months.
Ross  (to Monica and Rachel) Its winter, they are fewer people on the
street. (Rachel and Monica smile and nod, knowingly.)
Monica  Who are they killing off?
Joey  Uh Cecilia Monroe, she plays Jessica Lockhart.
Rachel and Monica 
Monica  Shes my favorite character on DOOL.
Joey  Nice.
Rachel  She is so good at throwing drinks in peoples faces, I mean I
dont think Ive ever seen her finish a beverage.
Monica  And the way she slaps all the time!
Rachel  Oh!
Monica  Wouldnt you love to do it just once?! (Raises her hand towards
Chandler.)
Chandler  Dont do it.
Rachel  Cecilia Monroe man, what a great actress.
Joey  Oh, tell me about it. And shes been on the show forever, its
gonna be really hard to fill her shoes.
Ross  Yeah-yeah, help me out here, when you come out of the "brain
transplant," you are going to be her?
Joey  Yes, but in Drake Remorays body. (Ross laughs unbelievably.) Why is
this so hard for you to get? I thought you were a scientist!
[Scene  Phoebe and Rachel sitting on the couch in Central Perk]
Phoebe  (Clears Throat) Rach, so, that guy there. Straight or gay?
Rachel  (They both look behind them.) Well, I'd have to say gay.
Phoebe  Yeah? Why?
Rachel  Well mainly because he's kissing that other guy.
Phoebe  Oh no not that guy there. That guy right there. (Pointing to an
attractive man sitting at a table behind them.)
Rachel  Oh yeah he's too cute to be straight.
Phoebe  (A woman with large breasts walks in the door) Ohh knockers will help us
figure it out. (She walks by and he checks her out.)
Rachel  All right, straight, and not subtle. (The man gets up and leaves.)
Phoebe  Ohh, he left his cell phone.
Rachel  Oh, well, we can hand it to Gunther and he'll put it in lost and found.
Phoebe  Or we could use it to call China. See how those guys are doing.
Rachel  What if, um, if he calls his own cell phone to find out who found it and
I answer and we start talking and we fell in love. I mean wouldn't that be a great story?
Kind of like a fairy tale for the digital age.
Phoebe  Yeah That does sound great. I'm going to get the phone. (They both
get up.)
Rachel  What? Wait! Whywhy do you get the story?
Phoebe  I don't know. I haven't been out on a date in so long.
Rachel  Phoebe, you had a date three days ago.
Phoebe  That wasnt a date! That was, that was just friends getting
together(quietly) having sex.
Rachel  Okay. Okay, see? I get the phone.
Phoebe  No way! No way! You just broke with Tag a week ago.
Rachel  Yeah! (Breaking up) And until now, I didnt think Id love
again.
Phoebe  Nice try.
Rachel  Oh hey-hey wait! How do we fairly decide who gets the phone?
Phoebe  I dont know.
Rachel  Well umm, maybe we could uhh (Grabs the phone) Ah-ha! Too slow!!
Phoebe  Ah-ha! Too cocky!
[Scene  Silvercup Studios, Joey is watching Jessica Lockhart perform a scene.]
Dina  Im going to keep dating him Mother, and theres nothing you can
do about it!
Jessica Lockhart  Oh yes there is!
Dina  What are you going to do? Kill him? Like you did with Charles?!
Jessica Lockhart  (gasps) That was an accident! And so were you.
Dina  Well, at least Im not a murderer! (Jessica slaps her.)
Jessica Lockhart  (crying) Oh, my baby! (Hugs Dina, but moves Dinas head
to her other shoulder so that shes the only one in the picture.)
The Director  Cut!
Joey  That was a great scene! And-and-and that slap looks so real! How do you do
that?
Cecilia  Oh, just years of experience.
Dina  (crying) Can I get some ice here?!
Joey  Oh anyway, I just wanted to say how wonderful I think you are.
Cecilia  Youre not the fan whos dying are you?
Joey  Say what?
Cecilia  Im supposed to meet and hug a fan whose dying, but thats
not supposed to be until (to no one in particular) later!
Joey  No. No, Im Joey Tribbiani; we did a scene together yesterday.
I-Im the guy in the coma!
Cecilia  Oh that was a real person?!
Joey  An-an-anyway I-I just wanted to say that since Im getting your brain
when you leave the show, I was wondering if there was any tips you can give me
Cecilia  I-I-Im leaving the show?
Joey  (quickly) I dont know. Why? Did you hear something?
Cecilia  Who told you that?
Joey  Oh uh, one of the writers.
Cecilia  Which one? Was it bald or was it tall?
Joey  Umm
Cecilia  Yknow what? It doesnt matter! Because it is not true!
Joey  Okay.
Cecilia  And if it were true, how dare you come to me ask me for tips
about a character that Ive been playing for 20 yearsIll give you a tip!
(She throws her drink in his face.)
Joey  Ms. Monroe (She slaps him) Oh there you go. (She storms off, leaving
Joey standing next to Dina. They share a nod at the ferocity of the slap they just
received.)
[Scene  Central Perk, Phoebe and Rachel are still arguing over the phone.]
Rachel  No Phoebe! You cannot get the phone that way; thats not fair! Okay
look, I have an idea. Why dont we, why dont we see what kind of number he has
on his speed dial, and then from that we can tell who has more in common with him. And
then whoever does gets the phone.
Phoebe  Or, we can decide by whose ever name is closer to the word phone.
Rachel  I dont think so.
Phoebe  (handing Rachel the phone) Fine all right, but Id bet youd
be singing another tune if we were fighting over a ratchet.
Rachel  (checking the speed dial) All right, first name on the speed dial is
mom.
Phoebe  Ohh, I lost my mom to suicide.
Rachel  Okay no way, you cannot use that to get the cute guy and the last
blueberry muffin.
Phoebe  Did I use that already today? Im sorry.
Rachel  Yes okay. (Checking the speed dial again.) Well now see this isnt
telling us anything. (Reading the speed dial) Joe. Carlos. Peter. Ooh! Peter Luger! T
hats a steak house!
Phoebe  Okay, a meat eater. Fine, thats one for you.
Rachel  (looking at the speed dial) Oh, I win! Hes got Barneys
on his speed dial.
Phoebe  So you dont know thats Barneys the store! That
can be yknow his friends house, or a bar. Who has Barneys the
store on their speed dial?
Rachel  (showing Phoebe her phone) His new girlfriend!
[Scene  Monica and Chandler's, Monica and Chandler are eating lunch, when they start to
hear a horrible screeching noise. It sounds like someone is skinning a cat.]
Monica  What is that?
Chandler  I think its the dying cat parade.
Monica  It sounds like its coming from across the street.
Chandler  (turning around and looking) Oh my God!
Monica  What?
Chandler  Yknow that thing that Ross was gonna do at our wedding?! He was
hanging out with me yesterday and he turned to me and said, "Youre half
Scottish right?"
Monica  Nooo!!
Chandler  Yes!!
[Scene  Monica and Chandler's, scene continued from earlier. They both get up and move
to the window.]
Monica  No, there is no way! It can not be Ross! (She looks through the
window and sees Ross practicing and fumbling around with the pipes.) Unbelievable! Why
is your family Scottish?!
Chandler  Why is your family Ross?!
Monica  He cannot play at our wedding! I mean everyone will leave! I mean come
on, that is just noise! Its not even a song!
Chandler  If you listen very carefully, I think its Celebration by Cool
and the Gang.
[Scene  Phoebe's apartment, Phoebe is putting out some Sunflower seeds as Rachel
enters.]
Rachel  Hi Pheebs!
Phoebe  Hi!
Rachel  How are ya?
Phoebe  Good.
Rachel  Umm Pheebs, remember when we were in the coffee house we decided that I
was going to keep the uh, the cute guys cell phone?
Phoebe  Yeah.
Rachel  And remember how I said I was going to keep it in my purse so that if it
rang I could just pick it up?
Phoebe  Yeah!
Rachel  And do you remember going into my purse and stealing the phone?!
Phoebe  Ooh, now you lost me.
Rachel  You stole the phone!
Phoebe  No I didnt!
Rachel  No? So youre saying that if I called it, it wouldnt ring?
Phoebe  No.
Rachel  Umm, okay. But while you dial, let me show you the features of my new
ringing handbag. (Rachel dials her phone and Phoebes bag starts to ring.) Oh, it
does work! (Rachel grabs the phone and takes it out of Phoebes handbag.)
Rachel  Phoebe!
Phoebe  That is a different phone.
Rachel  Oh is it?! (She answers the cute guys phone.) Uhh, hello? (On her
phone) Yes hi, is Rachel there? (On the other phone) Yes she is, just one moment please.
(To Phoebe, holding out both phones.) Its for me!
Phoebe  That is damning evidence.
Rachel  Oh my God! I bet thats him. My digital fairy tale is about to
begin. I wonder how I should be? Should I be uh (In a sexy voice) Hello? Or should I be
(Happily) Hi! Its Rach (Phoebe knocks the phone out of Rachels hand,
catches it, and answers it.) Would you stop doing that?!
Phoebe  (on phone) Hello? (Listens) Yes, Im the one who found your phone.
Rachel  Phoebe! You cant do th
Rachel  You do know that I will be here when he comes over.
Phoebe  Oh? And how will you know what time to come over?
Rachel  You just said it!
Phoebe  Oh. Okay, well I-I was kinda hoping that I would justbe alone
yknow to think about my mom and her suicide.
Rachel  Oh Phoebe!
Phoebe  What?! Thats the first time today!
Rachel  Ohh! (Exits.)
[Scene  Silvercup Studios, Dina is at the craft services table getting some food as
Joey walks up.]
Joey  So you like the nachos uh? Myself Im partial to
Dina  (interrupting) Im 16.
Joey  See you in 2003. (She walks away.)
Cecilia  (walking up) Youre absolutely right they are writing me out of
the show. They dont know exactly when its going to happen, but apparently
going to be very soon and thats it.
Joey  Im so sorry. Look, if it was up to me you would never leave the
show.
Cecilia  Yeah, thanks.
Joey  No I mean it! I cant believe they would do this to you! And to your
fans! I mean they are going to be devastated! Heart broken! They love you so much!
Cecilia  Oh youre right. Thank you! Whats your name again?
Joey  Joey.
Cecilia  Joey, well thank you. That is so sweet. Oh, excuse me. (She throws her
drink on a passing writer.)
The Writer  It wasnt my decision!
Cecilia  (to him) Im having a conversation here! (To Joey) You were
saying?
Joey  Uh yeah-ye-ye-ye-ye-yel-l-l-l-l-look the-the-the only reason that I,
that I came up to you before was because well, Im really nervous about-about being
you. Yknow if you can help me capture the essence of the character. Yknow?
Help me keep Jessica alive. Please?
Cecilia  All right Joey, I will help you. Not because I-I owe it to this stupid
show, but because I owe it to Jessica.
Joey  Oh thats great! Oh thank you so much!
Cecilia  Youre so welcome.
Joey  Hey! Now, Ive been watching some tapes, hows this? (In a
British accent.) "Jessica Lockhart will never step foot in this place again!
Ever!!"
Cecilia  Is that supposed to be me?
Joey  Yeah.
Cecilia  Yeah but Jessica doesnt have an English accent.
Joey  (shocked) I can do an English accent?! That babys going on my
resume!
[Scene  Central Perk, Monica and Chandler are sitting on the couch. Ross is sitting on
the armchair.]
Chandler  Well, I feel like a snack!
Monica  Do you want some shortbread? Eh thats Scottish like you are.
Chandler  Oh no thanks. I dont like any thing from my Scottish
heritage.
Ross  What?!
Chandler  Well its just my entire family was run out of Scotland
byVikings. Anyway, lots of bad memories. (Makes a few unintelligible noises.)
Ross  Oh well, it sounds to me like your family is ready to uh, rediscover its
Scottish roots.
Monica  No! No-no theyre not. Theyre still very angry! But
yknow Chandler is also half-Swedish. You know what the Swedish people are famous
for? Sitting down and being quiet.
Ross  Well yeah-yeah the Scottish history is so much more
Monica  (interrupting) You can not play bagpipes at the wedding!!
Ross  How did you know about that?!
Chandler  We heard you play all the way from your apartment!
Ross  Were you the ones called the cops?!
Chandler  Thats not really important right now. What is important is;
while we appreciate the gesture, we just dont feel bagpipes are appropriate for our
wedding.
Ross  Why not?
Chandler  Because we hate them.
Ross  Come on thats not fair! I mean you havent even heard me play!
Chandler  We have heard you play.
Ross  No, youve heard my practice. Okay? Just-just give me a chance to
perform for you and then decide whatever you want. And Im not going to tell you what
song Im gonna play either. But uh, lets just say when its over Ill
bet there will be a we bit o celebration.
[Scene  Silvercup Studios, Joey is getting pointers on how to play Jessica Lockhart.]
Cecilia  So, the essence of the character is rooted in her confidence. So, when
Jessica enters a room for instance, she owns everything and every person in that room.
(Joey is nodding.) You try.
Joey  Okay! (He scurries out the set door and re-enters, extremely impressed)
All right!
Cecilia  No, he already knows that he owns everything in the room! Hes not
finding it out for the first time! So, try it again.
Joey  Okay. Okay. (He goes out and comes back in, glaring at everything.)
Cecilia  Right. Hes not angry at the room either. Try it again, he owns
it! He owns the room. It is his. He owns, owns, owns, owns the room! He owns it!!
(Joey gets a snooty look on his face.) All right, its a little weird, but its
getting better. (Joey is pleased.) Oh well, Im gonna miss this woman so much. I
dont know what Im going to do! I mean, its been 20 years of my life.
Joey  Oh wellHey-hey! Maybe, maybe uh, maybe this is a good thing.
Yknow? Itll-itll give you a chance to shake things up, play different
characters. Youre so talented.
Cecilia  I am. I am, but I dont know you know. An actor of a certain age
is not that easy.
Joey  Hey thats not true! Look at uh, look at Angela LansbAngelina
Jolie!
Cecilia  I probably shouldve just left years ago when the offers were
pouring in, but yknow I just got so comfy here! And Ohh, I turned down some
amazing work!
Joey  Like-like what?
Cecilia  Well, lets just say if I left 15 years ago, the landscape of
Mexican cinema would be very different today!
Joey  (impressed) Wow!
Cecilia  But Well now, nows a different time for me. (Starts to
cry.)
Joey  Oh hey come on, dont-dont-dont do this! Umm, look
let-let me tell you something, okay? Now when I watch you do a scene, Im thinking,
"Boy, she-she is a great actress!" (Shes not buying it.) Uh but-but, I am
also thinking, "She is hot!"
Cecilia  (intrigued) You think Im hot?
Joey  You own the room. (She smiles and stares longingly into his eyes.) We
should probably get-get uh
Cecilia  Oh yeah-yeah, we should get the (Pause) So when Jessica kisses a
man, she usually puts umm, both her hands on the mans face. (She does so.)
Joey  Yeah-yeah, I noticed that! Is that cause shes so passionate?
Cecilia  No! Its because that way the camera only sees her! (She takes her
hands off his face.) Do you wanna try it?
Joey  Yeah! Okay. (He puts his hands on her face and they kiss.)
Cecilia  That was good, that was really good. But I-I think your hands maybe a
little off, they should be maybe right like (She grabs the back of his neck and
kisses him passionately causing them to fall onto the couch.)
[Scene  Phoebe's apartment, Phoebe and Rachel are waiting for the cute guy to show up
for his cell phone. Rachel is putting on perfume by spraying it ahead of her face, and
moving into it. Phoebe tries to steal some.]
Rachel  Hey! Hey!
Phoebe and Rachel 
Guy 
Phoebe  Whoa! Why do you get to answer the door?
Rachel  Well why shouldnt I?!
Phoebe  Because its my apartment!
Rachel  Well, then I get to give him the cell phone.
Phoebe  Okay. All right. (Hands her the phone.) Good luck explaining all the
calls to China.
Tom  Hi!
Phoebe  (To Rachel) Wow! How long were we arguing for?
Rachel  (laughs) Youre not the man who left the cell phone.
Tom  No thats my assistant.
Rachel  Is-is he coming? (Looks hopefully out the door.)
Tom  Umm, no.
Phoebe  Could you-could you umm, give us one second?
Tom  Sure!
Rachel  Well be right back sir.
Tom  Sure.
Phoebe  Wh-what do we do?
Rachel  I dont know!
Phoebe  Can you believe this? (Rachel exhales in amazement.) We were waiting for
a hot guy and then an even hotter one shows up!
Rachel  I know! (Realizes what Phoebe said.) What?!
Phoebe  Hmm, they just dont make em like that anymore!
Rachel  (turning and looking at Tom again) No-no they do but, you just have to
wait.
Phoebe  Rachel, listenI mean, if you let me have him then I will really
owe you one.
Rachel  (fake disappointment) All right. All right Phoebe I will let you have
him, but you owe me; you owe me big!
Phoebe  Yeah! Youre such a great friend!
Rachel  Ohh
Tom  So, which one of you lovely ladies am I going to take to dinner huh?
Phoebe  Oh thatd be me. Sir. (Hands him the cell phone.) After you.
Tom  Okay. Okay. (Exits and Phoebe checks him out.)
Phoebe  (whispering) Nice!
[Scene  Joey and Rachel's, Cecilia is entering the living room from Joeys room
followed by Joey.]
Cecilia  Well, you certainly own that room.
Joey  Actually I rent the whole place and, I just got what you meant. Thank you.
Rachel  Hi.
Joey  Hey!
Rachel  Oh my God! Oh my God!! Ohh, Jessica Lockhart!! In my apartment!! I am
such a huge fan! I am such a huge fan!
Cecilia  Well, its nice to know that you
Rachel  (screaming) MONICA!!!! MONICA!!!! (Runs to Monicas.)
Joey  That uh, that is my roommate Rachel.
Cecilia  Oh that explains all the womens underwear.
Joey  (shrugs) Sure. Yep.
Monica  (entering with Rachel) Oh my God! Its true!! Oh my God you are so
amazing! Oh my God, can I just ask you to do me oh, just one favor?
Cecilia  Certainly.
Monica  Would you slap me? Would you slap me right here in the face?! (Points to
her cheek.)
Cecilia  Id love to, but my lawyer said I cant do that anymore.
Rachel  God. You seem really, really nice.
Joey  Okay, bye-bye.
Rachel  I mean n-not-not fake at all like most famous people.
Joey  All right, here we go. (He grabs them and starts to pull them out of the
apartment.)
Rachel  Okay.
Monica  (breaks away) Oh wait, just one more thing! One more minute! (To
Cecilia) Umm, youre a stupid bitch.
Cecilia  I really cant slap you. (Monica walks away angrily)
Rachel  You are so beautiful.
Monica  Nice to meet you! My God youre great!
Joey  Thanks for stopping by. See ya! (Throws them out and closes the door.) (To
Cecilia) I-I am so sorry. I
Cecilia  Oh no-no-no-no, being adored. Im used to it, dont worry
about it.
Joey  (notices something in the mail that Rachel brought in) Oh my God!
Cecilia  What?
Joey  They sent me todays script! They never send the script!
Cecilia  They dont?
Joey  Well no, Im just in a coma. This must mean I have lines! (Realizes
what that means.) Oh
Cecilia  How does it happen?
Joey  (flipping to the last page) Ew, you get thrown from a horse into an
electric fence.
Cecilia  Ah what?! Jessica hates horses!
Joey  Yeah well, Im guessing after this shes not going to be crazy
about electricity either.
[Scene  Monica and Chandler's, Rachel, Phoebe, Chandler, and Monica have gathered to
hear Ross perform his interpretation of Celebration by Cool and the Gang on
the bag pipe.]
Ross  now remember you have to imagine me in a kilt.
Rachel  (giggles) (To Ross) I can imagine you in a short plaid skirt and knee
socks.
Ross  (To Rachel) Do you wanna start telling secrets?
Rachel  No!
Ross  (stands up) Now umm, remember Im still learning.
Ross  One, two, three, four!
Ross  You know the song! Sing along!
Ross  So?
Monica and Chandler 
[Scene  Silvercup Studios, a scene is being shot where Dina and Fredrick are
celebrating Jessicas horrible accident by drinking champagne.]
Dina  Loosening the saddle on mothers horse was brilliant Fredrick. And
the electric fence, inspired.
Fredrick  Thank you sweetheart. (They clink glasses.)
Dina  I cant believe shes really gone. Look around you, all of this
is ours. (They move into kiss but; theyre stopped by Joey entering with a huge
bandage wrapped around his head.)
Joey  (as Jessica) I dont think so.
Dina  Who are you?!
Jessica Lockhart  Whats the matter Dina? Dont you recognize your own
(Does a hair flip) mother?!
The Director 
Cecilia  (running out to Joey) That was so wonderful! (Hugs him) Ohh, I think
that youre a better Jessica than I ever was!
Joey  Oh noo
Cecilia  Well of course not, but you were very good.
Joey  Thanks!
Cecilia  And guess what? Good news! I got another job!
Joey  Great! Hey! All right! Well-well what is it?!
Cecilia  A film in Guadalajara!
Joey  The airport?
Cecilia  No thats La Guardia. (Joey nods in recognition.) This is Mexico.
Joey  Ohh. Wow! Well how-how, how will you be gone?
Cecilia  Eight months.
Joey  Thats a really long time.
Cecilia  Yeah, but you can come and visit me. I bet that you could uh, own a few
places down there.
Joey  Well I tell ya, I should probably buy a place in the city first.
(Realizes.) And I just got what you meant againThat isI tell ya, that is a
tricky one!
Cecilia  That is a tricky one. Well, Joey I really wanna thank you. Youve,
well you made a very difficult time for me a little less painful.
Joey  Good luck.
Cecilia  You too.
[Scene  Monica and Chandler's, Rachel, Phoebe, Chandler, and Monica have gathered to
hear Ross perform his interpretation of Celebration by Cool and the Gang on
the bag pipe. Yes, I typed that earlier. Were seeing this again, only this time Ross
as already started playing.]
Ross  You know the song! Sing along!
Phoebe  Eeee!!! Eee!! Eee!!
Matthew Perry  Eee!! (This causes more laughter.)
Lisa Kudrow  Do it again!
(Why was this the trailer? Well, thats because it was an introduction into the
special out takes episode that immediately followed the show. The entire out takes
episode, Friends  The Stuff Youve Never Seen can be read
by following this link.)
[Scene  Joey and Rachel's, Rachel is filing her nails as Ross and Ben enter.]
Ross  Hi.
Rachel  Hi! Hi Ben!
Ben  Hi.
Ross  Hi, we have a little bathroom emergency.
Rachel  Oh, yeah go ahead.
Ross  Uh, before we do uh, are any of Joeys special romance magazines in
there?
Rachel  No. No.
Ross  (to Ben) Okay! All clear!
Ben  (running to the bathroom) Thanks Phoebe!
Rachel  Ben, its Rachel! (He closes the door.) But whatever.
Ross  (to Ben) Everything okay in there?
Ben  Dont talk to me now!
Rachel  Awww, just like his daddy.
Ross  Hey listen can you do me a big favor? The deans office just called
and said there was an urgent meeting. Can you watch Ben for like an hour?
Rachel  What-what about Monica?
Ross  Oh, she isnt home.
Rachel  (nervous) So it would just be, me alone?
Ross  Well, Ben would be there.
Rachel  Huh umm
Ross  Whats the matter?
Rachel  Well thatyknow its just uh, Ive never done that
before. Me and him alone.
Ross  Rach, hes not an ex-con.
Rachel  Okay. Okay. Okay. Uh, what do I, what do I do with him?
Ross  I dont know! Just-just talk to him-entertain him and keep him alive.
Rachel  Okay.
Ross  Okay. (Ben enters) Ben? Come here. All right, Im gonna leave you
here with Aunt Rachel for about an hour. Okay? Are you gonna be okay?
Rachel  Yeah I think so.
Ross  (To Rachel) I wasnt talking to you.
Ben  Ill be okay.
Ross  Okay, Ill see you soon buddy. (He hugs and kisses him.) Be back in
an hour.
Ben  Bye dad.
Rachel  Bye. (Ross exits.) Ahhh (Silence) So this is fun, huh?
Ben  Not really.
Rachel  Okay. Uh, want something-want something to drink?
Ben  Okay.
Rachel  Uh great! How do you feel about Diet Coke?
Ben  Im not allowed to have soda.
Rachel  Okay. Well thats pretty much all that we haveOh! Oh! Have
you ever had a virgin margarita? (Holds up a bottle of margarita mix.)
Ben  Whats a virgin?
Rachel  Water it is.
[Scene  Central Perk, Monica and Chandler are talking. Joey and Phoebe are getting
coffee.]
Monica  What about the second minister we meet with? I kinda liked him.
Chandler  You mean the spitter?
Monica  Come on! It wasnt that bad!
Chandler  Easy for you to say; youll be wearing a veil.
Monica  All right, what about the third guy?
Chandler  You mean the guy who kept staring at your chest?
Monica  Can you blame him?
Chandler  Sorry, I just dont like the idea of when I say, "I
do," hes thinking, "Yeah, Id do her too!"
Monica  Well then we still have a problem.
Chandler  Yeah!
Phoebe  (returning with Joey) With what?
Monica  Well, were trying to find someone to perform our wedding and
theyre all either boring or annoying or yknow, cant stop staring at the
ladies. (Points to her chest.)
Phoebe  Oo! You should have one of us do it!
Monica  Phoebe, were getting married, married; not sixth grade
married.
Phoebe  No! No! Its-its uh a real thing! Anyone can get ordained on
the Internet and perform like weddings and stuff!
Monica  Are you serious?
Phoebe  Yes! A friend of mine did it and its totally legal!
Joey  I call it!!
Phoebe  What?! No! It was my idea!
Chandler  Guys thank you very much but neither of you is marrying us.
Joey  Does calling it not mean anything anymore?!
Chandler  We are going to have a legitimate member of the clergy! And when I say
legitimate I mean, gay and in control of his saliva!
[Scene  Joey and Rachel's, Rachel and Ben are sitting on the couch bored out of their
minds.]
Rachel  Ben yknow when uh, when you were a baby, you and I used to hang
out all the time. Cause I was, I was your daddys girlfriend.
Ben  But youre not anymore!
Rachel  No, Im not.
Ben  Cause you guys were on a break.
Rachel  Hey! We were not on aOkay. Thats fine! Fine.
Yknow what Ben? One day when you are a lot older I am going to tell you that entire
story over a pitcher of real margaritas, okay?
Ben  Whens my daddy coming back?
Rachel  (checks her watch) Fifty-two minutes. (Pause) So no-no brothers and
sisters, huh? That must be nice. You dont have to share stuff.
Ben  Sharing is good.
Rachel  Oh, youre one of those. But yknow what? I have two
sisters of my own and we just-just tortured each other.
Ben  Really? Like how?
Rachel  Well yknow, we would umm, repeat everything the other said, or uh,
wed jump out of closets to scare each other, or switch the sugar for the salt so
theyd put salt on their cereal.
Ben  (laughs) Thats a good one.
Rachel  Yeah? You like that one?
Ben  Yeah, youre funny.
Rachel  Im funny? Oh thank God! Well hey, Ive got a ton of these!
Umm, oh hearDo you want a good one? Heres a good one. Umm, you uh, you take a
quarter, take a quarter and, and you blacken the edge. Right? (Does so.) And then you say
to person, I bet you cant roll this quarter from your forehead to your chin without
it leaving your face. And then when they do it, theyre left with a big black pencil
line right down the center of their face.
Ben  Can I do it to you?
Rachel  Yeah, I-I-I-Im funny Ben, but Im not stupid. Okay?
[Scene  Monica and Chandler's, Monica and Chandler are eating lunch as Joey enters.]
Joey  So, did you uh, find anyone to marry you guys yet?
Chandler  No, but Horny for Monica Minister called, wanting to know if we were
still together.
Monica  Were never gonna find anybody.
Joey  Well then let me do it!
Chandler  Joe
Joey  No-no-no! Look, Ive been thinking about it. Im an actor right?
So I wont get nervous talking in front of people.
Monica  Joey look its really sweet
Joey  No-no-no-no look no! I wont spit, and I wont stare at
Monicas breasts! Yknow? Everyone knows Im an ass man!
Monica  That is true.
Joey  Yeah and the most important thing is that it wont be some like,
stranger up there who barely knows you. Itll be me! And I swear Ill do a
really good job. Plus, yknow I love you guys and-and it would really mean a lot to
me.
Chandler  (To Monica) Yknow, we havent found anybody else.
Monica  It might be kinda cool.
Joey  So I can do it?
Chandler  Yeah you can do it.
Joey  All right!!! Okay!! All right! Okay-okay, I gotta get started on my
speech! Oh, wait a minute, Internet ministers can still have sex right?
Chandler  Yeah.
Joey  Okay.
Monica  Hey Pheebs, hows it going?
Phoebe  Oh, I have a headache. A horrible headache!
Monica  Oh, Im sorry. Can I get you something?
Phoebe  Oh my God, youve got to stop chattering!
Monica  Here, take a couple of these. (She gets up to grab a couple of pills.)
Phoebe  What is it?
Monica  Its Hexadrin.
Phoebe  Oh no, I dont believe in Western medicine. No, if you just apply
pressure to these points right here. (Shes pinching the bit of skin between her
right thumb and forefinger with her left hand.) Then your hand starts to hurt and you
still have a headache, so thanks. (Takes the pills.)
Monica  Okay, while were waiting for these pills to kick in, Im
gonna sit you down on the couch. Come on. (Phoebe gets up and goes with her.) Get some
nice soft pillows under your head, Im gonna turn the TV on and you can watch
whatever you want. And ImSit down(She sits down on the couch)gonna
make you some tea. And then, Im gonna rub your feet.
Phoebe  Oh.
Joey  Oh! My head! Oh! (Hes sitting on the chair, lies back, and puts his
feet up for Monica to rub.) Oh!
[Scene  Joey and Rachel's, Rachel is reading and there is knock on the door which she
answers.]
Rachel  Coming.
Ross  I have a bone to pick with you.
Rachel  Uh-oh.
Ross  Yes! Ben learned a little trick.
Rachel  Oh yeah? Did he pull the old (She is waving her hand up and down
her face. Shes thinking about the pencil mark.)
Ross  Thats right! Thats right! Saran Wrap on the toilet seat
so the pee goes everywhere!
Rachel  Oh that.
Ross  Yeah that! You know I hate practical jokes! Theyre mean and
theyre stupid and-and I dont want my son learning them!
Rachel  Oh, come on! Saran Wrap on the toilet seat, you dont think
thats just a little funny?!
Ross  I was barefoot. Now tell me, the toilet thing is the only thing you taught
him right?
Rachel  (looking at his mark) Yes.
[Scene  Central Perk, Phoebe, Chandler, and Monica are there.]
Phoebe  Its amazing! My headache is completely gone! What are those pills
called?
Monica  Hexadrin. (She gets the box out of her purse.)
Phoebe  Oh, I love you Hexadrin! (She kisses the box.) Oh look! It comes with a
story! (She pulls out the instructions and side affects paper.)
Monica  No Phoebe, those are like the side affects and stuff.
Phoebe  Say what?
Monica  Yknow, the possible side affects.
Phoebe  Oh my God! (Starts reading them.) Dizziness, nervousness, drowsiness,
facial swelling, nausea, headacheHeadache. Vomiting, stomach bleeding, liver damage!
Now okay, I dont recall any of this coming up when you gave me these little death
capsules! Oh Im sorry, extra strength death capsules!
Monica  Phoebe, relax none of that stuff ever happens! They just put it on there
for legal reasons!
Phoebe  Why?
Monica  In case it happens.
Joey  (entering) Hey!
Chandler  Hey!
Joey  Say hello to Reverend Joey Tribbiani! (Holds up the piece of paper bearing
the proof of his ordination.)
Chandler  Hey!
Monica  You did it! You got ordained?!
Joey  Yeah, I just got off the Internet! Man, there is a lot of porn out there!
Chandler  Our minister
Phoebe  I have liver damage. Ow! Oh! (She grabs the left side of her torso.)
Monica  Phoebe, your liver is right here. (She points to the right side of her
torso.)
Phoebe  Okay, then I must be disoriented.
Joey  Anyway, I started working on what Im going to say for the ceremony,
do you wanna hear it?
Chandler  Okay.
Monica  Yeah!
Joey  Now-now, listen this is just a first draft so (Starts to read the
piece of paper he brought.) "We are gathered here today on this joyous occasion to
celebrate the special love that Monica and Chandler share." (Monica and Chandler like
it so far.) Eh? (He continues reading.) "It is a love based on giving and receiving.
As well as having and sharing. And the love that they give and have is shared and
received. And through this having and giving and sharing and receiving." (Phoebe nods
her approval.) "We too can share and love and have and receive."
Chandler  (To Monica) Should we call the spitter?
[Scene  Carol and Susans, there is a knock on the door and Carol opens it to
reveal Rachel.]
Carol  Hey Rachel! (The camera cuts to her face and we see that Ben pulled the
quarter trick with her as well.)
Rachel  Hi!
Carol  What a nice surprise! What are you doing here?
Rachel  Well yknow I was just in the neighborhood and I passed by your
building and I thought to myself, "Whats up with Carol and sweet, little
Ben?"
Carol  Can I ask whatCome on in.
Rachel  Okay.
Carol  Umm uh, Ill make some coffee and we can uh, chat.
Rachel  Id love that. I would loooove (Carol goes to make the coffee
and she sits down.) So uh, so where is sweet little Ben? I would love to have a little...
Ben  (jumping up from behind her chair) Gotcha!! (Rachel jumps up startled.)
Rachel  I found him! (To Ben) Very funny, come here! (She sits down on the
coffee table and Ben walks up.) That is exactly why Ive come here to talk to you
okay?
Carol  (from the kitchen) Rach, do you want some sugar in your coffee?
Rachel  Yes oh(To Ben)Do I want sugar in my coffee? (Ben nods no.)
No, just some milk would be good Carol. Thanks. (To Ben) Okay, do you remember all that
stuff I taught you yesterday?
Ben  (mimicking her) Remember all that stuff I taught you yesterday?
Rachel  Dont do that.
Ben  Dont do that.
Rachel  Seriously, your dad doesnt like pranks.
Ben  Seriously, your dad doesnt like pranks.
Rachel  Oh damnit!
Ben  Oh damnit!
Rachel  No! Dont say that! Dont say that!
Ben  Damnit!
Rachel  No dont! Go back to repeating!
Ben  Damnit!
Rachel  Oh crap!
Ben  Oh crap!
[Scene  Monica and Chandler's, Phoebe, Joey, Chandler, and Monica are returning from
Central Perk.]
Phoebe  I feel like my face is swelling. (To Monica) Is my face swelling?
Monica  Phoebe, your face is fine! Come on, none of this stuff is going to
happen to you! Stop being such a baby!
Phoebe  Oh, interesting you should call me that! Now that I may never have one!
(Holds up the warning label.)
Joey  Okay you guys, I got a little more written. Are you ready?
Chandler  Yeah. O-okay.
Joey  (reading) "When I think of the love that these two givers and
receivers share, I can not help but envy the lifetime ahead of having and loving and
giving and" And then I cant think of a good word for right here. (He
points to the stop on the paper where he left off.)
Monica  How about receiving?
Joey  Yes!
Chandler  See Joe, not that thats not grrreat! But, one of the cool things
about having somebody we know perform the ceremony is that it can be about us!
Yknow, it can be more personal. You can tell stories about us!
Joey  Ooh, like the time you and I went to Atlantic City and I made you laugh so
hard you threw up your whole steak?! Remember?
Chandler  No, not us (Motions Joey and him.) Us! (Motions Monica and him.)
Monica  I gotcha. Sorry. (To Monica) So, did you ever make him throw up a whole
anything?
Phoebe  Did you ever feed him a poison capsule that made him bleed from the
eyes?
Monica  It doesnt say that!
Phoebe  Oh! Suddenly somebody knows all about the side affects!
Chandler  See Joe, we want you to tell stories but yknow, romantic
stories. Nice stories.
Joey  Oh. Okay. Ooh! Ooh! Okay, maybe Ill talk about London! Yknow
when you two hooked up! Only, only I wont say hooked up. Ill say, "Began
their beautiful journey"
Monica  There you go!
Joey  "by doin it."
Chandler  Joe?
Joey  Okay. All right. Umm, so uh, so how did it happen? Did your eyes meet
across the room? And then the next thing yknow youre in the bathtub together
and shes feeding you strawberries?
Chandler  Isnt that what happened with you and the brides maid?
Joey  Yeah!! I call that London style.
Monica  No that is not what happened with us. Well, I was umm, I was really sad
that night because this guy that I was Rosss mom.
Joey  Oh.
Monica  And then Chandler was, was really sweet and he consoled me. And well we
drank too much
Joey  Yeah baby!
Chandler  And I was a perfect gentleman and I walked her to her hotel room and
said goodnight.
Joey  Oh.
Chandler  But then later that night
Joey  Yeah baby!
Chandler  (answering the door) Hey!
Monica  (standing outside) Cute PJs! Youre really livin it up
here in London huh?
Monica  (entering) Is Joey here?
Chandler  Well, last time I saw him he was heading out the door with the
brides maid and a bucket of strawberries. So uh, youre not still upset about
what that guy told ya are ya?
Monica  Wouldnt you be?
Chandler  Well, look its been a really emotional time yknow, and
youve had a lot to drink. And youve just got to let that go okay? I
mean you were the most beautiful in the room tonight!
Monica  Really?
Chandler  You kidding? Youre the most beautiful woman in most rooms
(She jumps up and kisses him.) (Breaking the kiss.) Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whats going
on? You and I just made out! You and I are making out?
Monica  Well, not anymore.
Chandler  But we dont do that.
Monica  I know, I just thought it would be fun.
Chandler  How drunk are you?
Monica  Drunk enough to know that I want to do this. Not so drunk that you
should feel guilty about taking advantage.
Chandler  (thinks) Thats the perfect amount!
Monica  Okay!
Monica  (breaking the kiss) Yknow whats weird?
Chandler  What?
Monica  This doesnt feel weird!
Chandler  I know.
Monica  Youre a really good kisser.
Chandler  Well, I have kissed over four women. (They kiss again.) Do you wanna
get under the covers?
Monica  Hm-hmm!
Chandler  Okay!
Monica  Wow! You are really fast!
Chandler  It bodes well for me that speed impresses you.
Monica  Were gonna see each other naked.
Chandler  Yep!
Monica  Do you wanna do it at the same time?
Chandler  Count of three?
Monica  One!
Chandler  Two!
Monica  Two!
Monica and Chandler 
Chandler  Well I think its safe to say that our friendship is effectively
ruined.
Monica  Eh, we werent that close anyway!
Chandler  Eh!
Chandler  Joey! Joey! Joey! J-J-Joey-Joey-J-Joey! (Monica hides under the covers
as Joey enters. Remember?)
Joey  Hey!
Chandler  Hey Joe! I was just watching a movie-e-e (Notices that the TV is
turned off.)
Joey  Oh, dude Im so sorry!
Chandler  No! No! No!
Joey  Hey no-no-no-no! Its cool! Its cool! I-Ill only be a
second, Im still with my brides maid, I justWhere are those condoms you
brought?
Chandler  Theyre in my bag over there. (Points.)
Joey  Ah. (Joey walks to Chandlers bag by getting as far away from
Chandlers bed as possible.)
Chandler  Uh, could you leave me one?
Joey  (pause) For just you?
Chandler  Yeah.
Joey  Hey listen, why dont you come downstairs with me? Theres some
really nice girls down there.
Chandler  No I-I-Im fine.
Joey  All right, here you go buddy. (He tosses him one.) Go nuts. (Exits.)
Joey  Thats what that was?! Cause that other thing? I thought you
were on to something, but it did nothing for me.
Monica  Okay, can we change the topic? Because its really doing
nothing for me.
Joey  Oh (To Chandler) Can you imagine if I hadnt left you that last
one? You two mightve never gotten together. Ooh-ooh! Could you imagine if I sent
that hooker up to the room like I was gonna?! Its like it was in the stars!
Phoebe  Yeah, its totally meant to be. (To Monica) Tell him who you
originally wanted to hook up with that night.
Monica  What?!
Chandler  What?
Phoebe  (To Joey) What?!
Chandler  Who did you originally want to hook up with?
Monica  Okay, fine but please dont be upset! Okay? I was really
depressed okay? And really drunk! I just wanted something stupid and meaningless. I just
wantedjust sex. So, when Iwent to your room that nightI was actually
lookingfor Joey. (Joey smiles.)
Joey  Yeah baby! (Chandler glares at him.) No baby!
[Scene  Monica and Chandler's, scene continued from earlier.]
Chandler  (To Monica) So you came to the room looking for Joey? Did you ever
in-intend on telling me about this?
Monica  No because it-it didnt seem important.
Chandler  Oh, its not important? Its not important?! If it
wasnt for a brides maid youd be marrying him (Points to Joey) not me!
Monica  Noo!! The point is that is was you that was there that night! It
is you that I am marrying! It is you that I feel in love with!
Joey  And it is a love that is based on having and giving and receiv(Shuts
up on Monicas glare.)
Chandler  I dont believe it. The most romantic night of my life and
Im runner up.
Monica  Chandler, please! Do you know how unbelievably glad I am that Joey was
not there that night?!
Joey  Hey! (Monica turns and looks at him) Now Im a man of the cloth, but
I still have feelings!
Chandler  (To Joey) Look there is no way youre doing this wedding now.
Okay?
Joey  What?! Thats not fair! Its not my fault! I was off with my
brides maid! And whos to say I wouldve even said yes?! (To Monica) I
mean I wouldve said yes. Chandler look y-y-you are making way to big a deal out of
this, all right? Look, everything worked out okay!
Chandler  Okay, its just weird! Okay? I dont want to be standing
their saying my vows and then having the mental image of you and Monica! I-I-I needI
dont know what I need. I need a walk.
Monica  Wait Chandler come on, letsits not a big deal!
Chandler  It is to me. You wanted to sleep with Batman, and instead you
had to settle for Robin. (Walks out and slams the door.)
Joey  This is crazy.
Phoebe  I know! Robin is so gay!
[Scene  Carol and Susans, Rachel is talking with Ben.]
Rachel  So now what have we agreed?
Ben  No more pranks.
Rachel  And-and what else?
Ben  That you and daddy were not on a break.
Rachel  Very good.
Ross  Rachel! What are you doing here?
Rachel  Im just visiting my good friend Carol.
Ross  Your good friend?
Rachel  Yeah!
Ross  Whats her last name?
Rachel  CarolLesbian?
Ross  Nice. And by the way that uh, that line down my face?
Rachel  What line?
Ross  Wh-wh-what line? The line that prompted a student in my last class
of the day to say uh, (In a college frat boy voice) "Dude, dont you ever was
your face?"
Rachel  All right, Im sorry. Im sorry I didnt tell you but you
were so mad already!
Ross  Of course I was mad! I told you I-I hate this stuff! Okay? It-its
not funny!
Carol  (entering from the kitchen) Hey Ross!
Ross  Hi.
Carol  Whats not funny?
Ross  Practical jokes.
Carol  Oh II think theyre funny.
Ross  You have a line down your face.
Carol  What? (Goes and checks.)
Rachel  Okay, maybe they are not funny to you
Carol  (yelling from the bathroom) Oh my God!
Rachel  Or Carol! But theyre funny to kids and who is it hurting?!
Ross  Uh, yknow what? Ill tell you who it hurts! It hurts the kid
who has all his clothes stolen in gym class so he has to go to the principals office
wearing nothing but a catchers mitt!
Rachel  That was you?! We heard about you in Junior High! Did you really
just shake your fist in the air and shout, "I will be revenged?!"
Ross  I will be! Listen, I dont want you teaching my son that stuff
anymore. Okay?
Rachel  Fine. Fine, but Ill have you know that once I taught him that
stuff he called me Fun Aunt Rachel. And I loved being Fun Aunt Rachel but Ill go
back to being Boring and Uncomfortable Aunt Rachel if thats what you want!
Ross  No thats not what I want. Uh, Im glad you guys were bonding
but I
Rachel  Look he doesnt have any brothers or sisters, somebodys gonna
have to teach him this stuff! And I havent taught him anything that a normal
6-year-old doesnt know anyway!
Ben  (yelling from off camera) Crap!!
Rachel  I gotta go! (Runs out.)
[Scene  Central Perk, Chandler is sulking on the couch as Joey enters to talk with
him.]
Joey  Hey.
Chandler  Hey. Do you want this scone? (Holds up his plate) It came for me but
it would probably rather sleep with you!
Joey  Chandler, come on nothing even happened!
Chandler  Look Joe, I know you wanted to do the wedding
Joey  No-hey-no! If you dont want me to do it, I except that. I dont
care about that. I justI dont want you to be upset.
Chandler  How can I not be upset? Okay? I finally fall in love with this
fantastic woman and it turns out that she wanted you first!
Joey  Yeah for like a half an hour one night! Chandler, she wants you for the
rest of her life! Youre so lucky! Look what I missed out on by not being there!
Although you know what? It could never have worked like you guys did, cause you guys
are perfect for each other. Yknow, we look at you and-and we see you together and it
justit-it fits. Yknow? And you just know its gonna last forever.
Chandler  Thats what you should say.
Joey  What?
Chandler  When youre marrying us; thats what you should say.
Joey  Really? I can do it?
Chandler  Id love it if you would do it.
Joey  Hey! (They hug.)
Chandler  But those are the words! Those exact words!
Joey  Well I dont know remember exactly but, its-its pretty
much about having and giving and sharing and receiving.
[Scene  Joey and Rachel's, Rachel is in the kitchen as Ross and Ben are entering.]
Ross  Hey!
Rachel  Hey!
Ross  Hey Im sorry to do this to you again but uh, is there any way you
can look after Ben for a little bit? I-Ive got this meeting at school. And-and he-he
asked for his uh, Fun Aunt Rachel, so
Rachel  Ohhh! Well of course I will watch him! We have fun, dont we Ben?
(He nods yes.)
Ross  Okay, Ill see you later pal.
Rachel  Ohh, okay. (Ross has a sign on his back that reads Poop.)
WhAh-ha! (Ross stops and turns.) Wait a minute. Uh Ben, I cant do it.
Ross  What?
Rachel  I cant let him go out that way, hes got a meeting. (To Ross)
Youve got something here on your back.
Ross  What? (She takes the sign off and hands it to him.) Thats great.
That is great. (Crumples up the paper and throws it down in anger.) What did we just
finish talking about Ben?!
Rachel  Oh I
Ben  What did we just finish talking about Ben?!
Ross  All right, thats it! (He runs over to Ben, but he runs past him and
out the door.) Comeyouno! You are in big trouble young man!
Rachel  No! Wait! Come on!
Ross  Wait! No! Ben, come here! I am not kidding!
Rachel  No you guys (She walks out into the hallway.)
Ross  I-I-am(Suddenly Ross starts screaming and comes falling down the
stairs landing just in front of Rachel.)
Rachel  EHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!! My God!!!!!!!!!!! Oh my God!!!!!!! (She runs over to
him and finds that it was a dummy and that she had been had.)
[Scene  Central Perk, Chandler and Monica are entering. Phoebe and Joey are sitting on
the couch.]
Joey  Hey!
Monica  Hey-hey.
Joey  So are guys doing okay?
Chandler  Yeah, we talked and Monica made me see that I over reacted a little
bit and some things in life are more important.
Monica  Yeah baby! (Phoebe and Joey nod.)
Phoebe  Im really glad you guys are okay but, I just keep thinking what
would happen if-if you two (Points to Monica and Joey) actually had hooked up.
[Scene  Monica and Joeys, Monica is cooking.]
Monica  Honey! Dinners ready!
Fat Joey  Whats my little chef got for me tonight?
Monica  Your favorite!
Joey  Ho-ho-ho, (pausing for a rest next to the fridge) fried stuff with cheese!
Monica  Yep! And lots of it!
Fat Joey  Thanks sweetheart. Give me a little sugar here. (They
kiss.) Okay.
Monica  Okay, in we go.
Fat Joey  Here we go! Here we go! Here we go! (Groans and picks
up a piece of food.) How you doin?
[Scene  Central Perk, Joey is getting Phoebe some coffee.]
Joey  Here you go.
Phoebe  (still reading the label) Oh my God! This is a six-hour pill! (Checks
her watch) Thats it! Im out of the woods! Ohh! What a relief!
Joey  Good for you!
Phoebe  Oh, its like huge weight has been lifted! Cause look, (reads
the side affects) no hair loss, not a rash, no hives, Im just so happy! Because no
shortness of breath, no temporary euphoriaOh.

[Scene  Central Perk, Monica, Chandler, Phoebe, and Joey are there. Monica is holding a
piece of paper.]
Monica  So the wedding caterer sent me this list of twelve appetizers and I have
to narrow it down to six.
Joey  Food? Uh-huh gimme! (She hands him the paper.)
Chandler  So did Monica tell you about this great band called the Swing Kings
that were trying to get to play at the wedding?
Phoebe  Since when are you into swing music?
Chandler  Oh since forever! I used to go all over town listening to bands!
Monica  Chandler.
Chandler  Gap commercial. (To Monica) So did you book them? Did you call?
Monica  I will.
Chandler  Do you want me to call?
Monica  No, Ill do it. You just stick to your job.
Phoebe  What is your job?
Chandler  Staying out of the way.
Joey  This is impossible Monica, why dont you just pick all 15? (Hands
back the paper.)
Monica  There were only twelve.
Joey  Oh yeah, I added three.
Monica  What are peanut butter fingers?!
Joey  Oh yeah (He mimes sticking his fingers into a jar of peanut butter,
scooping some out, and eating it off his fingers.)
[Scene  A Street, Chandler and Ross are at a newsstand.]
Ross  (noticing a beautiful woman moving in down the street) Well hello!
Shes cute! Should we uh, go try to talk to her?
Chandler  Sure! Thats one of the great things about being engaged.
Im not nervous talking to pretty girls anymore.
The Woman 
Ross  Uh yeah! Let me, let me get that for you.
The Woman 
Ross  (exhales) I got it. (He lifts the box and grunts under the strain.)
(Calmly) So hi, Im uh, Im Ross and this is my friend Chandler. (He shyly
waves.)
The Woman 
Ross  Kristen, hi. Are you uh, new to the area, cause if you
areId love to show you around sometime.
Kristen  II uh, actually just moved from four blocks over.
Ross  Ah.
Kristen  But-but this block is like a whole other world.
Ross  Yknow actually it does have a very interesting history. Uh, this
street is the first street in the city to have an underground sewer system. (Kristen
crinkles her nose at that.) Before that sewage and waste would just flow right down the
street. Yeah, sometimes ankle deep! (He stops when he realizes what hes talking
about.)
Chandler  (To Ross) Smooth.
Kristen  (To Chandler) Excuse me? (Chandler does the shy thing again.)
Ross  Umm, say youre gonna be starving after all this moving. What do you
say I take you to dinner tonight?
Kristen  Oh Id like that.
Ross  Yeah?
Kristen  Yeah.
Ross  Great! Uh, let me take this up for you. (The box hes holding.)
Kristen  After you.
Ross  Oh no-no, after you. (She grabs a chair and heads upstairs.) (When
shes gone.) Oh my God! (He drops the box and Chandler cant pick it up.)
[Scene  A Bridal Shop, Phoebe and Rachel are waiting for Monica who is trying on her
wedding dress.]
Phoebe  (wearing a veil) Am I crazy or does this totally go?!
Rachel  Oh my God! You look so beautiful!
Phoebe  (To Rachel) Thank you Rachel but, look at Monica!
Monica  This is it. Yeah, this is the one. I cant believe I found it!
The Woman 
Monica  Well Im Monica Geller, ball like a baby.
The Woman 
Monica  Have you found your dress yet?
Megan  Oh no, these dresses are all so amazing but there is no way I could
afford one.
Monica  No, I cant afford this either. No. I-I-Im, Im just to
figure out which one I want then Im gonna get it at Kleinmans, this discount
place in Brooklyn, day after tomorrow they are having a huge sale.
Megan  Oh, thanks for the tip.
Monica  Yeah! So-so when are you getting married?
Megan  Oh Im not, I just like to try these on.
Rachel  I do the same thing.
Megan  Im just kidding. Im getting married July 25th.
Rachel  Im just kidding too. (Laughs) Im getting married in
December. (Turns away not happy with herself.)
Megan  (To Monica) So when are you getting married?
Monica  Oh May 15th.
Megan  Oooh its getting close!
Monica  Yeah!
Megan  So uh, whos your photographer?
Monica  Jeffery.
Megan  We met with him. Did he show you the photos of the nude wedding he did?
Monica  The best man? Wow!
Megan  I know! I almost called off my wedding. Oh, whos your band?!
Monica  Oh, my fiancee wants the Swing Kings.
Megan  Oh, youre so lucky. My fiancee wants the heavy metal band Carcass.
Phoebe  Ooh, is that spelled with a C or a K? Oh my God!
It doesnt matter; theyre both great!
Rachel  Oh yknow what? Yknow what? Now that you know what you want
you should go to Kleinmans and get it half off. This place is so overpriced.
The Woman 
Rachel  So, does this (The dress) come in another color or (The store
owner walks away.)
[Scene  A Street, Joey is walking by Kristen who is still moving in.]
Joey  (checking her out) Hi! You uh, movin in or movin out?
Kristen  Im moving in.
Joey  Oh uh, can I give you a hand?
Kristen  Oh okay. But yknow what? Be careful. Because a guy was helping me
before had to leave because he hurt his back.
Joey  Boyfriend?
Kristen  No.
Joey  Im Joey. (They shake hands.)
Kristen  Kristen.
Joey  Oh wow, what a beautiful name! (Pause) What is it again?
Kristen  Kristen.
Joey  Got it! (He picks up a lamp.) So
Kristen  So uh, do you live around here?
Joey  Yeah! Yeah! Right down there. (Points.) Hey listen; let me give you a
little tip. Do not take a nap on this stoop (Points to hers) or you can wake up with your
shoes gone.
Kristen  Ill remember that.
Joey  Okay. Yeah. Listen would you uh, would you like to have dinner with me
tonight?
Kristen  Oh I, I have plans tonight.
Joey  Oh.
Kristen  But how about tomorrow?
Joey  Sounds great! Okay all right, well where does this go? (The lamp hes
holding.)
Kristen  You look strong, why dont I take that and you grab one of the
boxes.
Joey  Okay. Yeah. (She leaves and he goes to pick up a box marked books, but
decides to take the box marked pillows instead.) Yeah, Ill grab this one. (He
follows her upstairs.)
[Scene  Kleinmans, a horde of women including Rachel, Phoebe, and Monica are
waiting for the store to open.]
A Woman 
Rachel  (To Phoebe) So this is Brooklyn.
Monica  All right, listen up. There is usually only one dress in each size so
when they open those doors, fan out. Now, this is what youre looking for! (Holds up
a picture of it.) Memorize it! When you locate the dress, blow on these. All right? (She
passes out whistles to them.) Three short blasts, when you hear it. Come running.
Rachel  Okay.
Phoebe  Got it.
Monica  All right.
A Woman 
Rachel  Oh theyre pushing! Theyre pushing!!
Monica  (To Rachel) Hey! Dont be a baby!
Rachel  Well I
A Woman 
Phoebe  (coming back out) Hey! Rachel! Come on!!!!
Monica  No. No. Not it. Not it. Not it. (Checks another rack and another woman
tries to reach around her.) (To the woman) Dont crowd me! (Finds it) This is it!
This is the dress! Oh my God, its perfect! (She takes it off of the rack and someone
has a hold of it on the other side of the rack and tugs on it.) Im sorry, this
ones taken! (The other woman tugs harder pulling Monica through the rack.) Whoa!
Monica  Megan!
Megan  Monica!
Monica  You came?!
Megan  Yeah!
Monica  This is my dress!
Megan  No!
Monica  Yes it is! You saw me wearing it!
Megan  And now youll see me buying it.
Monica  What? You freak! You wouldnt even have known about this place if
it wasnt for me!
Megan  Look, you dont want to fight me.
Monica  Maybe I do! Im pretty feisty! (She blows the signal.)
Phoebe  (hearing the signal) Im coming! Im coming! (She takes off
towards the signal and almost knocks another woman over.)
Woman 
Phoebe  Okay! (Runs that way and hears another whistle blast.) Hey! (Heads the
other way and hears another blast.) What do I do?!! (She runs in the second direction and
finds that the whistling is coming from inside a rack. She moves the dresses out of the
way to find Rachel curled up in a fetal position frantically blowing on the whistle.) What
are you doing? (Rachel doesnt stop.) Did you find the dress? (Rachel wont stop
so Phoebe pinches her nose shut which causes her to spit the whistle out.)
Phoebe  Did you find the dress?
Rachel  No! You gotta get me out of here Phoebe! These bargain shoppers are
crazy!
Phoebe  IWe gotta get Monica. (She starts to leave.)
Rachel  No! You gotta hold my hand!!
Phoebe  Oh my God!! (She grabs Rachels hand and drags her towards Monica.)
Excuse me! Excuse me! (Shes knocking women and veils out of the way as she moves.)
Monica  (handing Phoebe the dress) Go! Go! Go!
Rachel  (seeing whos trapped) Hey
Monica  NOW!!!!!!!! (Rachel runs off and Monica gets up to follow her.)
[Scene  Central Perk, Chandler and Ross are there.]
Chandler  So Ross, how was your date the other night? Did you tell her about the
magical ride that starts with the flush of every toilet?
Ross  Laugh all you want but uh, she actually left me a message saying
shed like to go out again.
Chandler  Huh.
Ross  Yeah in fact, Im gonna go call her right now. And Ill make
sure to tell her my friend Chandler says (He mimics the shy reaction Chandler did.)
Joey  (entering) Hey Chandler!
Chandler  Hey!
Joey  Listen, sorry I didnt stop by last night but I had a date.
Chandler  Uh Joe, when its one oclock in the morning and you
dont come by? Thats okay!
Joey  Well check it out, I was with this really hot girl who just moved in right
across the street!
Chandler  Really? Right across the street?
Joey  Yeah!
Chandler  Whend you meet her?
Joey  Two days ago.
Chandler  Excellent! Yknow Ross met somebody too!
Joey  Oh yeah?
Ross  (returning) Hey.
Chandler  Hi! Howd it go?
Ross  Oh great! Were going out again Saturday. But I just found shes
also seeing some other guy.
Chandler  (sarcastically shocked) Really?! Joe? What would you do if you were in
Rosss situation?
Joey  Well, I sorta am. I mean yeah, Im dating this girl whos also
seeing another guy. But, I dont know, Im not to worried about it.
Ross  Well you shouldnt be. Believe me I wouldnt want to be the guy
whos up against you. (Chandler laughs.) I mean that doofus is going to lose!
Chandler  So this is nice! I wish I didnt have to go, believe me! But
unfortunately I have to. (He gets up and Joey moves over next to Ross.) Oh uh, by the way,
whats the name the girl youre dating?
Joey and Ross 
Chandler  Bye! (Exits.)
[Scene  Central Perk, time lapse from the earlier scene.]
Ross  Well obviously only one of us can keep dating her.
Joey  Obviously! So, how do we decide?
Ross  Well now lets-lets look at this objectively, I think I should
date her
Joey  (not buying it) Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Or, or Im the one who dates
her.
Ross  Thats interesting, but check this out. I date her
Joey  Yeah-yeah I like that but just to go in another direction
Ross  Okay, okay. This can go on for a while.
Joey  Yeah well we should order some food then.
Ross  No Joey! Look why dont, why dont we just let her decide? Okay?
Hey-hey, well each go out with her one more time. And-and well see who
she likes best.
Joey  (smiling) That sounds fair.
Ross  Maybe Ill take her to that new French restaurant down the
street
Joey  Ah yeahwait a second now! Look were gonna have to set a
spending limit on the date. I dont have the money to take her to a fancy place like
that.
Ross  Well sorry, thats what I do on dates.
Joey  All right, well I guess Ill just have to do what I do on dates.
Ross  So lets decide on the spending limit
Joey  Yeah. Uh, (thinks)a slice(Thinks)six dollars?
Ross  I was thinking more like a hundred.
Joey  Okay. Can I borrow 94 dollars?
[Scene  Monica and Chandler's, Monica, Phoebe, and Rachel are admiring Monicas
wedding dress.]
Monica  Oh
Phoebe  I know. Hand me a tissue. (Monica hands her one.)
Rachel  Youre out of Diet Coke.
Monica  Hello? (Listens) What?! (Listens) You what?! (Listens) Hey you listen
here missy! (Listens) Wh(She is hung up on.)
Phoebe  What?!
Monica  That was that girl Megan! She booked the Swing Kings on the day of our
wedding and said that I couldnt have them back unless I gave her the dress!
Phoebe  (gasps) Does that mean Carcass is available?
Monica  What am I gonna do?! That is the dress! That is the dress!
WhChandler wants the band. What do I do?
Phoebe  Well just figure out a way to talk him out of it.
Monica  How?
Rachel  Youre out of toilet paper!
[Scene  Ross's apartment, Ross is getting ready for his date with Kristen.]
Joey  (entering) Hey!
Ross  Hey! Whats up?
Joey  I just wanted to come by and yknow, wish you good luck on your date.
Ross  Oh thanks!
Joey  Yeah. What time are you meeting her?
Joey  Wow, thats in like 20 minutes. Youd better get dressed.
Ross  I am dressed.
Joey  Oh. Well good! (To himself) For me. (He picks up a jar of lotion.) What is
this? Did you give yourself a facial?
Ross  I have an oily T-zone!
Joey  Okay dude! (Finds a receit.) Hey you uh, you sent Kristen flowers.
Ross  Thats right.
Joey  You spent a hundred dollars. Thats the limit. Youre screwed!
Ross  Uh actually, I sent the flowers before the actual date. So techincally, technically
I didnt break any rules. Thanks for stopping by though.
Joey  Oh-oh! So thats the way its gonna be huh? Yeah I can break the
rules too yknow!
Ross  Oh yeah? What are you gonna do?
Joey  I dont know.
Ross  Why am I not surprised?
Joey  Yknow what Ross? Im not gonna let you get away with this!
Ross  I dont think you have much choice.
Joey  Well well see!
Ross  Bye-bye!
Joey  Yeah bye-bye! (Exits and comes back in still holding the lotion.) Hey! So
just a light layer?
Ross  Yes. Yes. Just here (Runs his fingers down the bridge of his nose) and
there (Runs his fingers across his forehead).
[Scene  Monica and Chandler's, Chandler is entering without touching anything with his
hands. Phoebe, Monica, and Rachel are there.]
Chandler  Joey got meat sauce on the banister again! (He goes into the bathroom
to wash his hands.)
Phoebe  Yeah, swing music is so out.
Monica  Phoebe, hes gotta be in the room for that to work.
Chandler  (returning) What are you guys talking about?
Monica  Well umm, we were just talking about the yknow, the Swing Kings
and just wondering whether yknow, they were the right way to go.
Rachel  Yeah, I went to a wedding once where they had swing music and uh, two
months later the couple got divorced. And now Im not saying that theres any
connection here yknow, but they did tell me thats why they got divorced.
Chandler  But I love swing music!
Phoebe  Yeah but the Swing Kings? Yknow they suck so much that people
actually die at their concertsThey just stop living.
Chandler  Look all I know is when Monica and I went to see them, we had fun! And
theres another reason too.
Rachel  Well, what is the other reason?
Chandler  I dont want to say.
Rachel  Well you have to because maybe its stupid.
Chandler  Well its just while Monica and I were dancing to them it
wasthe first time I knew thatyou were the woman I wanted to dance all my
dances with.
Monica  Oh crap!
[Scene  Grammercy Bistero, Ross and Kristen are waiting for their table to be ready.
Ross is returning from talking to the matired.]
Ross  So they said our table will be ready in just a few minutes.
Kristen  Oh great!
Ross  Yeah.
Kristen  Is your back feeling better?
Ross  Oh yeah its fine. I guess the more muscles you have the more they
can spasim out of control.
Joey  (entering) Kristen?
Kristen  Joey!
Joey  Hi!
Kristen  Hi! What are you doing here?
Joey  Oh I like this place. And technically, technically Im not breaking
any rules so I
Kristen  Well uh, Ross? This is Joey. Joey? Ross.
Joey  Hi!
Ross  Hi. (They shake hands.) Its nice to meet you. I used to have a
friend named Joey. I dont anymore.
Kristen  Our table will be ready in a couple minutes.
Ross  Yeah. So
Joey  Sure! I would love to wait with you guys! Thanks! (Sits down.)
Ross  So Joey umm, you look familiar. Are uh, are you on TV or something?
Kristen  Well Joey doesnt like to talk about it but, hes one of the
stars of Days Of Our Lives.
Ross  Thats right! Thats right, dont you play a woman?
Joey  A woman in a mans body.
Ross  Much better.
Joey  So yknow Ross its funny cause, you look familiar to me
too. Have you ever been married?
Ross  Well yes, yes I have. In fact umm, just the other day Kristen and I were
talking about how Ive been married and how I have a son.
Kristen  Yeah, little Eric.
Ross  Thats right! Wait no, Ben.
Joey  So youve just married the one time then?
Ross  Well umm
Kristen  Youve been married twice?
Ross  Yes. And another time after that. Boy Im getting hungry! Hey Joey,
have you ever been so hungry on a date that when a girl goes to the bathroom you eat some
of her food?
Kristen  You said the waiter ate my crab cake.
Joey  (laughs that one off) Yeah. So uh Ross, well nowwhy did that first
marriage breakup? Was it because the woman was straight or she was a lesbian?
Kristen  Do you two know each other?
Joey and Ross 
Joey  No. It just seems like Ross is the kind of a guy that would marry a woman
on the verge of being a lesbian and then push her over the edge.
Ross  Wait a minute! Were you on a poster for gonorrhea?
Joey  Have you ever slept in the same bed as a monkey?!
Ross  Hey you leave Marcel out of this!
Joey  Fine! Have you ever got stuck in a pair of your own leather pants?!
Ross  Hey-hey have you ever locked yourself in a TV cabinet VD boy?!
Joey  Monkey lover!
Joey  When do you think we lost her?
Ross  Probably around gonorrhea.
[Scene  Monica and Chandler's, Chandler is entering.]
Chandler  Hi, honey! Im home!
Monica  (from the bedroom) Dont come in here!
Chandler  Why? Do you another boyfriend in there or something?
Monica  No! We only mess around at his place!
Chandler  Yknow its funny I started it but, now its scary me.
So could you come out here please?
Monica  No, Im wearing a wedding dress.
Chandler  Oh you got a wedding dress? Thats great!
Monica  Yeah but Im not keeping it.
Chandler  Well then why cant I see it?
Monica  Oh. I guess you can. Okay but; I-I have to return it, so you cant
like it.
Chandler  Okay I promise. Ill-Ill hate it. (She enters.) Wow!
You-you lookhideous.
Monica  Really?
Chandler  Yeah, thats like the most ugliest dress Ive ever seen.
Wh-why do you to return it?
Monica  Oh because it doesntreally fit. Oh by the way, I-I booked
the Swing Kings.
Chandler  Oh thats great! Great! Thanks! But that dress I mean its
like yuck! Its terrible! It makes me wanna just rip it right off of you!
Monica  Okay! But you cant rip it. Well, maybe a little.
Chandler  Okay!
[Scene  Monica and Chandler's, Chandler, Joey, and Ross are watching a basketball game
on the couch.]
Monica  (entering) Hey guys! Do you wanna look at the song list for the wedding?
(They ignore her.) Guys?
Chandler  (without turning around) I thought you were gonna be gone all day.
Monica  All right? Whats going on?
Monica  Im sorry. Im sorry. I-I should probably leave you girls
alone. (She heads for the bedroom.)
Ross  Yeah, laugh all you want but in ten minutes were gonna have younger
looking skin!
Joey  Yeah! (Monica goes in the bedroom.) Yknow, she could use a
little(Whistles that she needs to do what theyre doing.) (Something happens on
the game.) Oh nice shot!!! (They all cheer.)

[Scene  Central Perk, Phoebe and Monica are there as Joey is entering excitedly.]
Joey  Hey! You guys! Youre not gonna believe this! I just got off the
phone with my agent
Phoebe  Oh my God! (Joey looks at her.) Im sorry, too soon. You go.
Joey  Okay. I got nominated for my part on Days of Our Lives!
Monica  Joey!
Phoebe  Good for you!
Monica  Congratulations! Wow! I cant believe youre nominated for an Emmy!
Joey  No-no.
Monica  Oh Soap Opera Digest award!
Joey  No! Im up for a Soapie!
Monica  Honey? Is that something youre making up?
Joey  No, no, no! Its real! And it has been since 1998. (Rachel returns
from the bathroom.) Hey Rach! Rach! Im up for a Soapie!
Rachel  (gasps) Oh my God! Oh my God!! That is like the third most prestigious
soap opera award there is!
Joey  Thank you! Well, I guess now I know who Im taking to the awards.
(Points to Rachel.)
Rachel  Oh, stop that! Dont kid about that! (Gasps) Will all the stars be
there?
Joey  Many are scheduled to appear.
Rachel  Oh my God! Oh my God! I cant go! Im gonna be too nervous!
Monica  (to Joey) Okay, Ill go!
Rachel  No!! You are getting married! This is all I have.
[Scene  N.Y.U, Ross is giving a lecture.]
Ross  and it was Ernst Muhlbrat who first hypothesized that the
Velociraptor would expand its collar and emit a high pitched noise to frighten
its predator. (A student raises his hand.) Yes Mr. Lewis?
Lewis  What kinda noise?
Ross  Just a high pitched intimidating noise.
Lewis  But like how?
Ross  Well we-we dont know for sure. But in my head it-it sounded
something like this. (He makes a high pitched noise and Alan doesnt know what to
make of it.) Of course, this is just conjecture. Okay, thats uh, thats all for
today. (Everyone starts to get up.) Uh Mr. Morse, can I see you for a moment?
Morse  Yes sir.
Ross  Mr. Morse I need to talk to you about your mid-term exam, Im afraid
I-I had to fail you.
Morse  (shocked) Why?!
Ross  Well you need 60% to pass
Morse  Whatd I get?
Ross  Seven.
Morse  Thats not so good.
Ross  No-no its not. What-what happened there Ned?
Morse  Well maybe you can cut me some slack. Im sort of in love.
Ross  Well Im sorry but, that-thats really not my problem.
Morse  Im in love with you.
Ross  Well that brings me in the loop a little.
Morse  You see, thats why I did so bad on this test. Im having a
hard time concentrating. When youre up there (Points to the podium) and youre
teaching and your face gets all seriousyou look so good. (In a sexy voice) You wear
that tight little turtleneck sweater
Ross  Okay! (Walks away from him.) Umm, I uh, Im your teacher. Im
sorry, youre-youre a student and I-and I like women. In spite of what may be
written on the backs of some of these chairs.
[Scene  Central Perk, Monica and Phoebe are drinking coffee and Phoebe notices a cute
guy checking them out.]
Phoebe  Oh my God! That guy at the counter is totally checking you out!
Monica  Really? (Looks.) My God, hes really cute.
Phoebe  Go for it.
Monica  Phoebe, Im engaged!
Phoebe  Im just saying, get his number just in case. But no Chandler is in
an accident and cant perform sexually and he would want you to take a lover to
satisfy the needs that he can no longer fulfill.
The Cute Guy 
Monica  Op, can I just tell you something? Very flattered but umm, Im
engaged. (Points to her ring.)
The Cute Guy 
Monica  Well you should be embarrassed. (Leaves.)
The Cute Guy 
Phoebe  I did, but that was really fun.
[Scene  Joey and Rachel's, Joey is sitting in the chair.]
Joey  (pretending to be an announcer) And the winner isJoey Tribbiani! (He
then gets excited and goes over to the counter to practice his acceptance speech using a
bottle of maple syrup as the award.) Oh Wow! I honestly never expected this. I uh, I
didnt prepare a speech. But umm, Id like to thank (Rachel enters quietly) my
parents, whove always been there for me. Id also like to thank my friends,
Chandler, Monica, Phoebe, Rachel
Rachel  Im fourth! (Joey is startled.) Look at you with your little maple
syrup award!
Joey  Yeah may-maybe you dont tell anyone about this.
Rachel  What? No! Its not a big deal! I do that too, with my shampoo
bottle.
Joey  Really?
Rachel  Yeah.
Joey  What award are you practicing for?
Rachel  Grammy, Best New Artist.
Joey  Oh, hey listen! The Soapies called today and I also get to present
an award.
Rachel  Ohh thats great!
Joey  Yeah!
Rachel  So youll definitely get onstage, even if you dont win.
Joey  (confused) What you-you dont think Im gonna win?
Rachel  Well of course I do! But yknow, favorite returning character is a
tough category Joey. I mean youre up against the guy who survived his own cremation.
Joey  Yeah. No-no I-I know I might not win, but its justIve
never even been nominated before! I want it so much.
Rachel  Well Joey, youll probably get it. But you should probably
your-your gracious loser face. Yknow when like the cameras are on you and you wanna
look disappointed but also that your colleague deserved to win. Yknow? So its
sorta like (Does it, youll have to see it.)
Joey  Hey! (Likes it.)
Rachel  Yknow?
Joey  You practice losing the Grammies too?
Rachel  Oh no, at the Grammies I always win.
Joey  Ah.
[Scene  Monicas Restaurant Kitchen, shes cooking as Phoebe enters.]
Phoebe  Oh hey!
Monica  Hey! Howd your date go with Jake?
Phoebe  Oh, great! We couldnt keep our eyes off each other all night and
then every once and a while yknow, hed kinda lean over and stroke my hair and
touch my neck. (Does that to Monica.)
Monica  Okay, stop it Phoebe, youre getting me all tingly.
Phoebe  (laughs) All I could think of was yknow, "Is he gonna kiss
me? Is he gonna kiss me?"
Monica  And did he?
Phoebe  Im a lady Monica, I dont kiss and tell. But this hickey
speaks for itself. (She starts to open up her blouse.)
Monica  Okay-okay, I got it. I got it.
Phoebe  I just like him so much that I just feel like Ive had 10 drinks
today and Ive only had six.
Monica  Oh, I havent had that feeling since I first started going out with
Chandler. Wow, Im never gonna have that feeling again am I?
Phoebe  You sound like a guy.
Monica  No, a guy would be saying, "Im never gonna get to sleep with
anyone else." Oh my God! Im never gonna get to sleep with anyone else!
Ive been so busy planning the wedding that I forgot about all the things that
Id be giving up! I mean, IIm never gonna have a first kiss again.
Phoebe  Youll have a last kiss.
[Scene  Joey and Rachel's, Ross is helping Joey with his tie.]
Ross  Can I ask you something? Have you ever had a guy have a crush on you?
Joey  Is that why you wanted to tie my tie?
Ross  Theres this kid in my class who said hes in love with me.
Joey  Whoa!
Rachel  (entering from her room) Whoa what?
Joey  Ross has a boyfriend.
Ross  I do-I do not have a boyfriend. Theres a guy in one of my
classes who-who has a crush on me.
Rachel  Really?
Ross  Yeah! I dont know. I mean, last year Elizabeth now-now this kid.
What-what-what-what is it?! Am I giving out some kind ofsexy professor vibe? (Rachel
and Joey both look at him.)
Rachel  Not right now.
Ross  It-itThe point is my natural charisma has made him fail his midterm.
Rachel  Oh, see now I feel bad for the kid! I had a crush on a teacher once and
it was so hard! Yknow youI couldnt concentrate and I blushed every time
he looked at me. I mean come on, you remember whats its like to be 19 and in
love.
Ross  Yeah. I guess I can cut him some slack.
Rachel  Yeah.
Joey  Howd you get over that teacher?
Rachel  I didnt. I got under him.
Joey  (To Ross) Problem solved.
[Scene  Central Perk, Phoebe is saying good-bye to her boyfriend Jake at the door to
Central Perk.]
Jake  Bye Phoebe.
Phoebe  Okay bye. (They kiss.)
Jake  All right. Bye. (Backs out the door.)
Phoebe  Bye! (Phoebe goes over and joins Monica on the couch.) We said good-bye
at the door so as not to flaunt our new love.
Monica  Phoebe, its okay. You dont have to tip toe around me.
I-Ive been thinking about it and umm, yknow what? Im okay about not
having that new relationship feeling
Jake  (yelling through the window to Phoebe) I miss you already!!
Phoebe  (yelling back) I miss you too!!!! (He walks away.)
Monica  See? Thats what I mean. I mean that, thats great! But
I wouldnt trade in what I have for that. I mean Im gonna be with Chandler for
the rest of my life, and thats what makes me happy. (Chandler approaches.) Hey
sweetie, come here! Come sit down. Hey Phoebe and I were just talking about how our
relationship is deep and meaningful. It really is dont you think?
Chandler  Oh totally! (Holds up his finger.) Pull my finger.
[Scene  The 2001 Soapie Awards, Joeys category is up next and the presenter walks
to the podium.]
Announcer 
Joey  (To Rachel) This is it! This is my category.
Rachel  I know! My God! Do you have your speech?
Joey  Yeah, I got my speech!
Rachel  Do you got your gracious loser face?
Joey  Yeah. (Does it.)
Rachel  Now Joey remember, if you win you have to hug me! You hug me!
Joey  Okay. Can I squeeze your ass?
Rachel  On TV?! Yeah!
Joey  Kay!
Joey  What the?! (Joey pounds the table and starts yelling at Rachel, and which
is drowned out by applause. Rachel is desperately trying to tell Joey that hes on TV
right now. He finally notices and he does his gracious loser face.)
[Scene  The 2001 Soapie Awards, the announcer is introducing the next presenter.]
Announcer 
Joey  (angrily and monotone) Any one of the brilliant actresses nominated for
this award tonight deserves to take it home. Unfortunately only one can. (Shakes his head
in disgust.) The nominees for Best Supporting Actress are from Passions Erin Goff.
(There is applause, which Joey disgustedly waits to dye out.) From One Life to Live
Mary Loren Bishop (They start to applaud again, but Joey interrupts in with the rest of
the nominees), from All My Children Sarah Mchann, and from Days of Our Lives
Jessica Ashley. And the winner is(Opens the envelope)Jessica Ashley from Days
of Our Lives. (Applause) Uh, unfortunately Jessica couldnt be with us tonight so
Ill be accepting this award on her behalf. (Realizes something) And Im sure
that Jessica would like to thank my parents who always believed in me. Shed also
like to thank my friends, Chandler, Monica, Ross, Phoebe, and Rachel whos
sittin right there! (Points at Rachel.) (The music starts and his microphone is
turned off, this angers Joey again and he disgustedly exits.)
[Scene  Joey and Rachel's, Joey and Rachel are entering.]
Rachel  Joey! Why did we have to rush out of there so fast?!
Joey  Rach we had to get out of there because, look what I won! (He whips out
the award for Best Supporting Actress that he accepted for Jessica.)
Rachel  Oh my God you stole her award!
Joey  No-no! No, Im accepting it on her behalf. (He puts it up above the
TV to display it.)
Rachel  Joey I dont think you know what behalf means.
Joey  Sure I do! Its a verb! As in, "I behalfin it!"
Rachel  Joey, you have got to take this back!
Joey  But why?! I shouldve won one and I really want it and she
didnt even care enough to come to the thing! It could also be a Grammy.
Rachel  (looking at the award) No! Joey!
Joey  Come on Rach! No one saw me take it! There was a whole table full of
em.
Rachel  Do you really want an award you didnt win?
Joey  No! I want an award I did win! But nobodys giving me any of those!
PlusHey Rach, if-if I put it up there (Points to the TV) right? When people come
over theyll see it and theyll think I won it.
Rachel  Joey is says Best Supporting Actress!
Joey  I can scratch that right off.
Rachel  Joey no, this is wrong! You have to take it back, okay? You dont
want to win an award this way. Youre very talented. And someday youre gonna
win one of these for real and that one is gonna mean something.
Joey  All right!
Rachel  All right? (He sets the award down.) Thank you.
Joey  Ill take it back tomorrow.
Rachel  Thank you.
Joey  (opening his door) If I cant have it you cant have it! (Rachel
walks away angrily.)
[Scene  Rosss Classroom, he is writing on the board and Alan is coming in to see
him.]
Lewis  Professor Geller?
Ross  (turning towards him) Yes Mr. Lewis, how can I help you?
Lewis  I know I didnt do well on my midterms and stuff but, I was kinda
hoping you could change my grade.
Ross  And why exactly would I do that? (Goes back to writing on the board.)
Lewis  Because Im in love with you.
Ross  (turning around and dragging the chalk down the board) What?!
Lewis  Yeah, Im allin love with you and stuff. So could you change
my grade?
Ross  No!
Lewis  Well why not you changed Neds grade!
Ross  Well thats different! Okay? Because he, he was actually in love with
me!
Lewis  No hes not! Hes totally yanking your chain! Hes done
this with three other teachers!
Ross  What?
Lewis  Hes got a girlfriend!
Ross  I cant believe someone would do that for a grade.
Lewis  I know! Its awful. I love you.
[Scene  Central Perk, Phoebe is sitting on the couch as Monica enters.]
Monica  Have you seen Chandler?
Phoebe  No. Why?
Monica  Cause I just keeping thinking about all these things that Im
not gonna have and its freaking me out. I dont know what to do about it.
Phoebe  Okay, dont sweat it. (Looking around her.) Chandler is nowhere
around so go ahead get it out of your system. That guys cute. (Points to a guy
sitting behind Monica.)
Monica  Phoebe! Come on Im serious! I just got to talk to him about all
this.
Phoebe  No that is the last thing you want to do!
Monica  Why?
Phoebe  Because youre marrying him!
Monica  You gotta help me out here Pheebs.
Phoebe  All right, Ive never been engaged and Ive never really been
married, but I can only tell you what my mother told me. Whenever you have doubts or fears
or anxieties about a relationship, do not communicate them to your husband.
Monica  So Im not supposed to share my doubts and fears with the guy
Im gonna spend the rest of my life with?
Phoebe  That is correct! Yes, youre supposed to take all of that stuff and
put it in a little box in your mind and then lock it up tight.
Monica  Your mother told you this?
Phoebe  Yes!
Monica  The woman that got married a bunch of times and killed herself when you
were 13?
Phoebe  Oh my God! Youre right! Go! (Monica starts to leave.) Go tell
Chandler! Hurry before its too late! Wait no! (Monica stops.) Does this also mean
putting out doesnt get you love? (Monica is shocked.)
[Scene  Silvercup Studios, Joey and Rachel are there to give Jessica her award.]
Rachel  I cannot believe Im gonna meet Jessica Ashley!
Joey  Okay wait-wait p-please be cool! Okay? I work with this woman.
Rachel  Okay, Im totally cool! (She coolly knocks on the door)
Jessica Ashley  Come in.
Joey  Hey Jessica.
Rachel  (coolly) Hey Jess.
Joey  Ah, this is my friend Rachel.
Jessica Ashley  Hi.
Rachel  Sup? (Joey glares at her.)
Joey  Uh listen, heres your Soapie. I accepted it for ya. (Hands it to
her.)
Jessica Ashley  (shocked) Oh my God! I won! Do you have any idea what this
means?! (She rolls her eyes and throws it onto the couch.)
Joey  Well, that-that-thats it? Youre gonna, youre gonna put
it on your self or anything?
Jessica Ashley  No, I try to save that for real awards. Now, if youll
excuse me. (She exits.)
Joey  (To Rachel) Take it back?
Rachel  Absolutely.
Joey  Y-y-yeah! (As they start to leave, Rachel pauses and steals a vase with
flowers in it.) Yeah you do. (They exit.)
[Scene  Monica and Chandler's, Monica is talking to Chandler.]
Monica  Honey, as we get closer to the wedding, is there anything that you would
like to talk about or share?
Chandler  Okay. Well, I think the centerpieces are too big
Monica  Youre wrong! The centerpieces are fine! Do you ever get scared at
all?
Chandler  Kinda. Theyre really big.
Monica  Doesnt it ever just freak you out that-that youre never
gonna be with anybody new again?
Chandler  What?
Monica  Just, I love you so much. JustIts just sometimes it bothers
me that Im never gonna have that feeling. Yknow when you meet someone for the
first time and its new and exciting? Yknow that rush?
Chandler  No. No, see when I first meet somebody its uh its mostly
panic, anxiety, and a great deal of sweating.
Monica  Okay, but all right youre a guy, does it not freak you that
youre never gonna sleep with anybody else?
Chandler  Sleeping with somebody new, anxiety, panic, and Im afraid even
more sweating.
Monica  Even with me?
Chandler  I was dangerously dehydrated during the first six months of our
relationship. (Monica laughs.) Look, for me the rush is knowing that we are gonna be
together for the rest of our lives.
Monica  Really?
Chandler  Well yeah! But now that I know that youre having these thoughts,
Im back to panic, anxiety, and uh Im definitely gonna need some kind of sports
drink.
Monica  Come here! Come here! (They hug.) Sweetie you dont have to worry.
No, besides yknow what? Im gonna have a lot of new things with you. The first
time we buy a house. Our first kid. Our first grandkid
Chandler  (hoarsely) Water! Water! Water!
[Scene  Rosss classroom, he has just finished his lecture and the students are
filing out.]
Ross  Uh Mr. Morse, can I speak to you for a moment?
Morse  (walking up) That was a great lecture today. Did you get a little hair
cut?
Ross  Uh-hmm, yeah-yeah do you like it? Do-do you looove it? I just want you to
know that Im changing your grade back.
Morse  What?! Why?
Ross  Cause I know what youre trying to pull here. Okay? Its
not gonna work.
Morse  Im not trying to pull anything. Look I love you dude.
Ross  Yknow what? I-Im not even gonna talk about this. Okay? This
little thing is over. I know you have a girlfriend! Okay(Ned looks
shocked)Yeah! And I know about the other professors! How do you think that makes me
feel Ned?! You used me! You dont love me and you never did! (Ross turns around to
make a grand exit but runs into two colleagues.) Ah Professor Winston, Professor
Fredrickson, Ill be right with you. (To Ned) Dont make this worse and
Ill give you a C. (To the professors) Shall we? (They leave.)
[Scene  Joey and Rachel's, Phoebe is entering.]
Phoebe  Rach?
Rachel  Ill be out in a second.
Phoebe  Oh. (Picks it up.) Its just so unexpected! II uhBoy
Ill tell you its just such an honor to be nominated for a Nobel Prize
and yknow to win one for a massage. Especially after having just won a Tony
award for best actress in
Rachel  Okay honey, you can finish this later were gonna be late. We gotta
go.
Phoebe  Please, dont play the music. Just uh one more. LIVE FROM NEW
YORK! ITS SATURDAY NIGHT!!
[Scene  Central Perk, Monica and Phoebe are on the couch as Joey enters.]
Phoebe  (To Joey) Oh hey! How was your audition?
Joey  Im sorry, do I know you?
Phoebe  What are you doing?
Joey  Nothing, Im just practicing blowing you off because Im gonna
be a big movie star!
Phoebe  Oh! You got it?!
Joey  Well, no not yet. But the audition went really good.
Monica  What was it for?
Joey  Oh, its this big budget period movie about these three Italian
brothers who come to America around the turn of the century. Its really classy! Oh,
and the director is supposed to be the next, next Martin Scorcese.
Phoebe  The next, next?
Joey  Yeah, theres this guy from Chicago whos supposed to be the
next Martin Scorcese, all right? But then this guys right after him. (Joeys
cell phone rings and he answers it.) Hello!
Estelle  Joey! Its Estelle! I just talked to the casting people;
they loved you!
Joey  (to Monica and Phoebe) They loved me!
Estelle  Yeah, they wanna see you again tomorrow.
Joey  (on phone) Oh my God!
Estelle  Theres just one thing. Do you have a problem with full
frontal nudity?
Joey  Are you kidding me? I never rent a movie without it! (Listens) Oh.
(Listens) Uh, okay uh let me call you back. (Hangs up.)
Phoebe  Whats the matter?
Joey  They want me to be totally naked in the movie!
Monica  Wow!
Joey  I know! My grandmothers gonna see this!
Phoebe  Grandmas gonna have to get in line.
[Scene  Monica and Chandler's, (although its really just Monicas now with Matthew
Perry in rehab) Monica is folding her laundry with Ross reading the paper and Phoebe
standing in the kitchen.]
Phoebe  Hey the wedding is so close! Are you getting nervous?
Monica  Yeah. But a part of me also cant wait til its over.
Chandler and I have this pact not to have sex again until the wedding.
Ross  A no sex pact huh? I actually have one of those going on with every woman
in America.
Monica  Hey Phoebe, will you give me a hand?
Phoebe  Sure.
Monica  I gotta make up the guest bedroom. (To Ross) Hey, Cousin Cassie is
coming to stay with us a few days.
Ross  Cassie?
Monica  Uh-hmm.
Ross  Wow, I havent seen her for like forever. I wonder if she still
carries that Barbie everywhere she goes.
Monica  Ross, shes 25 years old.
Ross  So what! I still haveNo youre probably right.
Rachel  (entering) Hi!
Monica  Hey!
Phoebe  Hey!
Rachel  Hey Pheebs, can I talk to you over here for a second?
Phoebe  Yeah!
Monica  Subtle guys!
Phoebe  What?!
Monica  I know youre planning my surprise bridal shower.
Rachel  (laughs) Well okayWell dont ruin it! Just play along at
least!
Monica  Okay. Sorry. (She goes into the guest bedroom.)
Rachel  (To Phoebe) Oh my God! We have to throw her a shower?!
[Scene  Monica and Chandler's, Joey is entering.]
Monica  Hey! What did you decide to do about the movie?
Joey  I dont know! Its not like its porn! This is a serious,
legitimate movie. Yknow? And the nudity is really important to the story.
Monica  Thats what you say about porn.
Joey  Youre right. Maybe I shouldnt even go on the call back.
Monica  No! No you should! A lot of major actors do nude scenes! I mean the
chance to star in a movie? Come on!
Joey  Well thats true. And I am only naked in one scene. Plus it sounds
really great. My characters catholic and he falls in love with this Jewish girl. Who
run away together and they get caught in this big rainstorm. So we go into this barn and
undress each other and hold each other. Its really sweet and-and tender.
Monica  Plus, everyones gonna see your thing. (Giggles.)
[Scene  Phoebe's apartment, Phoebe and Rachel are trying to plan Monicas shower.]
Phoebe  Well when can we have this shower?
Rachel  She has got so much going on we-we have only two options. We have
Friday
Phoebe  Well thats only two days away. What is the other option?
Rachel  Yesterday!
Phoebe  Well if we make it yesterday, woo-hoo! Were done!
Rachel  Oh my God Phoebe, this is impossible! We cant do this by Friday!
We have to find a place. We have to invite people! We have to get food! Theres just
too much to do! Its impossible! We cant do it! We cannot do it! We cannot do
it!
Phoebe  Rachel, calm down!
Rachel  (calmly) Okay. Im sorry. Youre right, youre right.
Phoebe  (grabs and shakes Rachel) Just calm down woman!
Rachel  Phoebe, I already, I already did.
Phoebe  Oh okay. All right, then I need to calm down a little.
Rachel  Okay. Okay. (They sit down.) I think we can do this if we just get
organized. All right? We have two days to plan this party. We just need to make fast
decisions! Okay? All right, where are we gonna have it?
Phoebe  Uh, here. What time?
Rachel  4 oclock. Food?
Phoebe  Finger sandwiches and tea.
Rachel  Ooh great! Very Monica.
Phoebe  And chili!
Rachel  Ah you went one too far. Uh, flowers or balloons?
Phoebe  Both!
Rachel  Were paying for this yknow.
Phoebe  Neither.
Rachel  Okay. Umm, what should we do for the theme?
Phoebe  Lusts of the flesh.
Rachel  (pause) What?
Phoebe  I dont know. (Timidly) A cowboy theme?
[Scene  Monica and Chandler's, Monica is on the couch writing when Chandler enters to
make his brief cameo.]
Chandler  Hey!
Monica  Hey!
Chandler  Yknow Im-Im really glad we decided not to sleep
together before the wedding.
Monica  Oh boy me too!
Chandler  Yknow I was thinking if we had aa big fight and uh we
broke up for a few hours
Monica  Yeah?
Chandler  Technically we could have sex again. What do you think, bossy and
domineering?!
Monica  The wedding is off, sloppy and immature!
Chandler  Thats me! Come on!
Monica  Okay. (They both jump up to head for there room, but Monica stops.) But
wait, we cant. My Cousin Cassie is in the guest room, were supposed to have
lunch.
Chandler  Well get rid of her, obsessive and shrill.
Monica  Shrill?! The wedding is back on!
Cassie  I thought I heard voices. You must be Chandler.
Chandler  (transfixed) Hi! Nice to meet you!
Cassie  Nice to meet you too.
Monica  So, are you ready to go?
Cassie  Yeah.
Monica  (catching him) Chandler!
Chandler  Ill be right with you.
[Scene  Central Perk, Ross is there as Chandler and Monica enters.]
Monica  (To Ross) Cassie needs to stay at your place.
Ross  Whatwhy?
Monica  Because Purvry Perverson over here cant stop staring at her.
Ross  What?! Chandler shes our cousin!
Chandler  I was not staring at her. Okay? I was just listening intently.
Its called being a good conversationalist. Watch. (Stares at Monicas eyes.)
Say something.
Monica  You were staring about eight inches south of there.
Ross  Fine, she can stay at my place. By the way, what-what does Cassie even
look like now.
Monica  She looks exactly like Aunt Marilyn.
Chandler  Umm, so this Aunt Marilyn is-is-is-is she coming to the wedding?
Monica  Wafer thin ice!
[Scene  A Casting Directors Office, Joey is entering for his callback.]
Joey  Hey, Im back!
The Casting Director  Hi-hi Joey.
Joey  Uh so, will-will I be reading the same scene again?
The Casting Director  Actually, I tried to call to you. You didnt need to
come down here today.
Joey  Oh great! Yknow I wouldve been perfect for this part, but
whatever! Yknow, thanks for making a bad decision and ruining your movie! Good day!
(Starts to leave.)
The Casting Director  Wait Joey! You didnt need to come down because the
director saw your tape from yesterday and loved it.
Joey  And scene! Huh? Wasnt that fun? We did a little improv there. Yeah!
Okay! So you-you-you-you were saying?
The Casting Director  Well, the director thinks youre really right for the
part and wants to meet you tomorrow.
Joey  Wow! Sure! Thats great!
The Casting Director  Oh and your agent said you were okay with the nudity.
Joey  Yeah! Yeah sure, just long as its handled tastefully and that barn
is not too cold.
The Casting Director  Terrific! Well uh, theres one more thing. Uhh, uh
its really important to the director that everything in this movie is authentic.
Yeah and so in your love scene with Sarah she talks about how shes never seen a
naked man who wasnt Jewish. So (Laughs.)
Joey  SoWhat?
The Casting Director  So uh well the director is insisting that whoever play
that part be authentically, anatomically not Jewish. Do you know what Im saying?
Joey  Yes!
The Casting Director  Okay.
Joey  No. What?
The Casting Director  An Italian Catholic immigrant at this time would not
be
Joey  Barmifsaed?
[Scene  Monica and Chandler's, Joey is telling Monica what the casting director was
trying to get too.]
Monica  So to get this part you cant be?
Joey  Nope.
Monica  But you are?
Joey  Yep.
Monica  But you told them you werent?
Joey  Thats right.
Monica  Wow! Wow! And its definitely all gone? Theres nothing there
to work with? (Joey glares at her.) What were you thinking?
Joey  I dont know! I really want this part! And they tell you no matter
what you get asked at an audition you say yes. Like if-if they want you to ride a horse,
you tell em you can! And just figure out how to do it later.
Monica  Joey! This is not like learning to ride a horse! This is like learning
togrow a turtleneck!
Joey  I kn-I know! I know! Okay? And apparently tomorrow when I go in to meet
the director I have to take off my clothes so that they can see what my body looks like.
Monica  Oh my God, what are you gonna do?!
Joey  I just have to call my agent and tell her I cant do the part. (Gets
up for the phone.)
Monica  Unless!
Joey  Unless what?
Monica  Well, this may sound crazy, but there maybe something we could fashion.
Joey  Like what?
Monica  Well Im not sure yet, but umm of the top of my head Im
thinking double sided tape and some sort of luncheon meat.
[Scene  Joey and Rachel's, Phoebe is entering and Rachel is still planning.]
Phoebe  Hey! Ive got a great idea for party favors for the shower. Okay,
we get some uh mahogany boxes and carve everyones names in them and inside is
everyones individual birth stone.
Rachel  Okay. Okay. All right, you take care of that. And meanwhile, the party
is tomorrow and we still dont have a guest list.
Phoebe  Okay. Okay! Well okay, who do we know thats coming? Me. Are you?
Monica  (entering) Hey!
Phoebe  Hey!
Rachel  Hey! Whats up Mon?
Monica  Well uh, Im trying to make something for Joey. Do you mind if I
raid your fridge?
Rachel  Have at it.
Monica  Okay. (Opens the fridge.) All right, turkey. Eh, that wont work.
Cheese? (Picks it up) That wont work. Olive loaf? (Picks it up) I hope that
wont work.
Rachel  Are you makin him a sandwich?
Monica  No its umm, more like a wrap. Okay so uh, Im gonna go guys.
Phoebe and Rachel 
Monica  I guess you can get back to deciding on what to get me for a present!
(Runs out.)
Rachel  (To Phoebe, after Monicas gone) We have to get her a present?!
Phoebe  Okay but look! Look at what I got! Its her address book! (Holds it
up.) We have a guest list!
Rachel  Oh my God youre amazing! Did you just pull that out of her purse?
Phoebe  Uh-huh, and a little seed money for the party. (Holds up $40.)
[Scene  Ross's apartment, there is a knock on the door and Ross opens it to Cassie.]
Ross  (shocked at her beauty) Cassie?!
Cassie  Hey Ross!
Ross  Hey!
Cassie  (hugs him) Its been so long! Last time I saw you, you were setting
up your tent in line to see Return of the Jedi.
Ross  Oh. Oh, thats right. So-so you did see me that day because it seemed
like you didnt.
Cassie  Ah yeah, sorry about that.
Ross  Its okay. Come, come on in.
Cassie  Thanks for letting me stay here! I mean Monicas place was nice,
but her fiancee sure stares a lot.
Ross  Oh.
Cassie  Oh my God! You do a great Chandler!
Ross  Uh-huh. Yeah I-I have a knack for impressions.
Cassie  Well, maybe after we get reacquainted uh, you can do me.
Ross  YeahNo!!
[Scene  Ross's apartment, Cassie is eating dinner and Ross is pacing behind her because
of what shes eating.]
Ross  Cassie, how you-how you doin on thathot dog.
Cassie  Im all done.
Ross  (quietly) Thank God.
Cassie  I guess the last time we really hung out was when our parents rented
that beach house together.
Ross  Oh right. Right. Ooh, remember the time I uh, I pinned you down and
tickled you til you cried? (She laughs) Were probably too old to do that now.
Cassie  Ill always remember that summer, because its when I got all
of these freckles. (She pulls her blouse open to show him her shoulder and bra strap.)
Ross  (looking then moving away quickly) Uh-huh! Uh-huh! And-and-and Ill
always remember that summer because thats when I realized that we are related.
Cassie  It took you that long to figure it out, huh?
Ross  Well Im, Im a little slow. (To himself) Just as our children
would be.
[Scene  Phoebe's apartment, its Monicas bridal shower and Phoebe is passing
out some finger food.]
Phoebe  Hi!
Woman  Hi!
Phoebe  How are you? (The woman nods) Good. (She goes over to another couple of
women.) Hi, thanks for coming.
Woman  Oh thank you.
Phoebe  Thank you. (To the other woman) No? (She nods.) All right. (She goes to
another pairing.) Oh, its so nice to see you.
Woman  No.
The Other Woman 
Phoebe  Okay. (Goes over to Rachel.) Hey Rach?
Rachel  Yeah?
Phoebe  Who the hell are all these people?
Rachel  Well, I dont know. I called all the people in Monicas phone
book and these are the only ones who could show up on 24 hours notice.
Phoebe  Hmm, yknow theres another word for people like that. Losers!
Rachel  (to her) Hi! Im Rachel. This is Phoebe. Im the maid of
honor. How do you know Monica?
Woman  I was her accountant four years ago.
Rachel  Ohhhh!
Woman  Im very interested to find out whos been doing her taxes
these last four years.
Rachel  Thats great!
Woman  So, what time is Monica supposed to get here?
Phoebe and Rachel 
Rachel  (to the woman) Excuse us for a minute. (They go into the kitchen.) You
didnt tell her to come?!
Phoebe  You were supposed to tell her!
Rachel  No I wasnt! You were supposed to tell her to come and I was
supposed to bring the cake!
Phoebe  Fine, Ill go call her.
Rachel  Yes! And please tell her to bring a cake!
[Scene  Joey and Rachel's, Joey is standing at the counter as Monica enters carrying a
tray.]
Monica  Okay, we have a lot of options here, a number of prototypes for you to
try on.
Joey  Wow! This looks great!
Monica  Yeah! Okay, this one is a mushroom cap. (Points to it.) Umm, this one is
made of bologna. (Points.)
Joey  And-and-and-and-and the toothpicks?
Monica  Oh, just until the glue dries.
Joey  Thank God!
Monica  (to a whole group) Now, these are-are more realistic, but perishable.
Joey  Ah.
Monica  Okay? (To a different group) Over here we have pink suede, which is
nice. But umm, if it gets wet then you know its gonna shrink.
Joey  Well maybe we just take that one away. (Picks it up and throws it away.)
Monica  I also, did a little something in fur. But umm, thats really just
for me. (Rubs it against her cheek.) Okay. So, why dont you go into your room and
try these on and well seeget a better idea of whats gonna work.
Joey  Thanks, you are such a good friend. And this is so weird.
Joey  Ow!
Monica  Toothpick?
Joey  Yeah.
Monica  What are you trying on now?
Joey  The fruit roll up.
Monica  And?
Joey  Delicious.
Monica  Joey!
Joey  Wait a minute! Wait a minute! We have a winner!
Monica  What?! Which one?!
Joey  The Silly Putty! Its not so silly anymore!
[Scene  Ross's apartment, Cassie and Ross are watching a movie and Cassie is pouring
Ross some more wine as Ross has his hands full with the glass and holding the bowl of
popcorn in his lap.]
Ross  (in his head) Shes your cousin. Shes your cousin! If
she knew what was going on in your head shed think you were sick! (She grabs
some popcorn.) Or would she? Lets back up a second. She was the one who
suggested opening a bottle of wine. She was the one who turned down the lights. She
was the one that wanted to rent Logans Run, the sexiest movie ever. (She
grabs the blanket from behind him and looks at him.) Oh, I know that look. Forget it. I
want it. She wants it. Im going in.
Cassie  Hey! What the hell are you doing?! (They sit back up.)
Ross  (in his head) Say something clever! (Pause.) Okay, doesnt
have to be clever, it just has to be words. Say some words. (Pause) Any words will
do. (Pause) Oh my God! This is the longest that anyone has not talked ever! (Pause)
There is nothing you can say to make this worse!! So just say something!! (Pause.) (To
her) I-I, I uh havent had sex in a very long time. (She leaves.) (In his
head) Yeah, you really shouldnt have said anything.
[Scene  outside Phoebe's apartment, Monica is knocking on the door.]
Monica  Phoebe! Rachel! Its Monica! I wonder what you could possibly need
me for on such short notice! (She bursts into the apartment to find only Phoebe and Rachel
sitting on the couch.) Oh.
Rachel  Oh Monica, we are so sorry.
Monica  For what?
Rachel  Well first, for forgetting to throw you a bridal shower.
Phoebe  And then for forgetting to invite you to it.
Monica  You al-you already had it?
Phoebe  Yeah. Well, we called everyone in your phone book and bunch of people
came, but it took us so long to get you here that they-they had to leave.
Rachel  Yeah, we wanted to throw you a big surprise and a great shower, and now
you dont have either.
Phoebe  We ruined everything.
Rachel  Ugh
Monica  Well no wait a minute thats not true! No, what did, that was
really sweet. And it kinda works out for the best.
Rachel  What do you, what do you mean?
Monica  Well now, I get to spend my shower with the only people I really love! I
mean, I get all those presents (Motions to the pile in the corner) without having to talk
to people I dont even like!
Rachel  Surprise
Phoebe  Sur-surprise.
Rachel  Monica.
[Scene  The casting directors office, Joey is there to show off to the director,
so to speak.]
Joey  And whats cool is, the character is from Naples, right?
The Director  Yeah.
Joey  My whole familys from Naples!
The Director  Oh thats great! Okay, well Ive heard everything I need
to hear. I just need to uh, Leslie
The Casting Director  Joey, this is awkward part.
Joey  Oh! Hey right! Not a problem. (He starts taking off his clothes.) I
totally understand. You need to yknow make sure I dont have any horrible scars
or tattoos. Dont you worry; I have nothing to hide. (He drops his pants and stands
back up and looks down.) So there you go, thats me. (We cut to a camera angle
looking at the casting director and movie director through Joeys legs.) One hundred
percent natural! (Suddenly, theres a thud as something falls off.) (Everyone is
shocked.) I tell ya, that has never happened before.
[Scene  Phoebe's apartment, Phoebe is getting out linens for Cassie who is in the
bathroom.]
Phoebe  Cassie, are you finding everything okay in there?
Cassie  Yeah! Thank you so much for letting me stay here.
Phoebe  Oh! No problem! I (Cassie emerges from the bathroom and we once
again visit slow motion Barry White background music land with the sexy hair-flipping
thing going on, only this time Phoebe is entranced. For more information on Denise
Richards you can visit your local library or look her up on the Internet at her official
website at www.deniserichards.com.)
Cassie  (noticing her) What?
Phoebe  (in her head) Say something! Say anything! Ask her out! Shes
not your cousin!
[Scene  Central Perk, Joey, Monica, and Rachel are sitting on the couch and Ross is
sitting on the chair, and theyre all talking.]
Rachel  Hey! Out of all of us, who do you think is gonna get married next?
Joey  Probably Monica and Chandler.
Woman  (to Gunther) Hi. Could I have a pack of Newport Lights,
please?
Gunther  Oh umm, uh we dont sell cigarettes, but they have them at the
newsstand across the street. (Points.)
Woman  Thatd be great, thanks. (Gunther goes and gets them.)
Rachel  (to the gang) Oh my God, Melissa Warburton. I dont think I have
the energy for this.
Melissa  (Gasps when she notices Rachel) Oh my God! Ray-ray Green?! (Screams)
Rachel  (screaming) Melissa!
Melissa  You have been M.I.A for the past seven sorority newsletters,
whats up with you?!
Rachel  Wh(Turns and looks at the gang whos staring)Why
dont I tell you over here? (She walks Melissa away from the gang.)
Melissa  So last I heard you were gonna get married. (Grabs Rachels hand
and notices that she doesnt have a ring on it.) (Sadly) Oh poor Ray-ray.
Rachel  Oh no-no, no! Its good! Its all good! I-I actually work at Ralph
Lauren!
Melissa  Shut up!
Rachel  I will not! Im the divisional head of mens sportswear!
Melissa  Oh shut up more! Now, are you friends with Ralph?
Rachel  Oh please
Melissa  (excitedly) Are you?!
Rachel  No.
Melissa  Listen, we-we have to have dinner. What-what are you doing tomorrow
night?
Rachel  Oh tomorrow, oh I dont know. Um
Melissa  You do now. Youre having dinner with me.
Rachel  Shut up.
Melissa  I-Ive got to go. This has been so great Ray-ray! (Gunther returns
with her cigarettes.) Oh, there you are. (Takes them from Gunther.) (To Rachel) Umm, so
listen, just call me. Heres my card. (Hands the card over.)
Rachel  Oh, wow thanks! (Reading the card) Oh youre in real estate!
Melissa  Oh no, thats-thats an old card. Umm, I wanted to get out of
that and-and do something where I can really help people and-and make a difference.
Rachel  Wow! What do you do now?
Melissa  (quietly) Im a party planner. Ill see you tomorrow.
(Exits.)
Rachel  Okay! (Joins the rest of the gang.)
Joey  Hey guys! Look whos back! Its Ray-ray!
Rachel  Shut up that was my friend Melissa from college.
Ross  She seems really, really fun!
Rachel  Shes actually very sweet and we used to be very close.
Monica  Wait a minute, she isnt Shes not the one who you
Joey  (excitedly) Who you what? Who you what?!
Rachel  (To Monica) Yes.
Monica  Wow!
Joey  (excitedly) Wow? Wow what?! Wow what?! Who youwhat?!!
Rachel  Its not a big deal!
Monica  (To Joey) They were lovers.
Ross  What?!
Joey  What?!
Rachel  No we werent! It was nothing! It was one night, senior year we
went to a party, had a lot of sangria and yknow, ended upkissing for a
bit.
Ross  So thats two of my wives.
[Scene  Monica and Chandler's, Monica is working on the seating chart while Chandler
looks on and Rachel reads.]
Monica  (telling Chandler the seating arrangement) Okay so this is where the
band is. (Points.) And this is where the bar is. (Points) And all these pins have
peoples names on them. (She has pins to show the seating at each of the tables.) And
Rach, here you are. (Points to Rachels place.)
Rachel  Oh wow. Why dont we just take me (Grabs her pin) and put me with a
Manhattan in my hand, talking to the cute bartender. (Puts her pin at the bar and laughs.
Monica just glares at her.) These pins arent for playing are they?
Monica  (To Chandler) Okay, the red ones are my guests and the blue ones are
yours.
Chandler  This is so sad. I mean, I only have like ten pins.
Monica  Chandler, relax its not a contest. (To Rachel) Certainly not a
close one.
Joey  (entering) Hello!
Rachel  Hey!
Joey  Hey Rach. (Stares at her.)
Rachel  Stop picturing it!!
Monica  Okay, I think thats it. The seating chart is done. This is our
wedding. They all look like theyre having fun dont they?
Joey  Hey, so where are my parents gonna be?
Monica  Oh! (Gets up) Lets see, wellif this is the wedding hall then
umm (Walks away) youre parents will be at home in Queens.
Joey  What theyre not invited?! Oh no, thats terrible! Theyre
gonna be crushed!
Monica  Why would they think theyre invited?
Joey  (looking around) You got me. I dont
Monica  Joey!
Joey  Well, Im sorry. I thought parents were coming! Yknow? Your
parents are comin! Chandlers parents are comin! Rosss parents are
comin!
Monica  Rosss parents are my parents!
Joey  Well-wellsee? Parents are comin!
Chandler  Yknow I think we should invite them.
Monica  Oh please, you just want more blue pins.
Chandler  Well this is just sad!
Monica  All right, all right. Maybe I can fit them in if I just do some
rearranging. But uh, Rachel may actually have to sit at the bar!
Rachel  That is not a problem.
Joey  (leaning down to her) Maybe youll order a little sangria?
Rachel  Oh, get out of here! (Jumps back and walks away.)
[Scene  Ralph Lauren, Rachel is showing Chandler the selection of tuxedos.]
Rachel  (motioning to a rack) So now, these are all the tuxedos that we make and
if theres anything that you like, we can make you a deal. Anything at all. (Grabs a
few) But these are the three that Monica pre-approved.
Chandler  Well, thanks a lot for hookin me up Rach. I want you to know
that I want you to attend our wedding as my guest.
Rachel  Im Monicas maid of honor. Okay? Dont try to blue pin
me!
Chandler  (sees another rack) Well, whats the deal with these? These-these
look nice.
Rachel  Oh they are nice. We-we custom-make tuxedos for celebrities and then
when theyre done with them they just send em back.
Chandler  You mean like for award shows?
Rachel  Some of them.
Chandler  You mean these tuxes have been down the red carpet with people
yelling, "You are you wearing?! You look fabulous!"
Rachel  Honey, might I suggest watching a little more ESPN and a little
less E!?
Chandler  Okay, who wore those? (Points to the tuxedos.)
Rachel  Umm, well lets see uh, this one is Tom Brokaw.
Chandler  Not bad.
Rachel  (reading a tag) This one is uh Paul ONeil.
Chandler  Whos that?
Rachel  He plays for the Yankees. Seriously, ESPN! Just once and a while,
have it on in the background. (Chandler nods and Rachel grabs another tux) Ooh, this one
was Pierce Brosnan!
Chandler  Pierce Brosnan?
Rachel  Uh-huh.
Chandler  Are you serious?
Rachel  Yeah.
Chandler  007?! This is James Bonds tux?!
Rachel  Yeah.
Chandler  Oh, I have to get married in James Bonds tux!
Rachel  Its a pretty cool tux.
Chandler  Oh, its not just that, I would be Englands most powerful
weapon. Jet setting heartbreaker on her majestys secret service. A man who fears no
one; with a license to kill. (Worried.) Would Monica let me wear this?
[Scene  Joey and Rachel's, Joey and Phoebe are moving chess pieces around on the board
and hitting the timer at random.]
Joey  We should really learn how to play the real way. (Moves another piece.)
Phoebe  I like our way. Oh! (Grabs a piece and jumps a bunch of Joeys like
in Checkers.) Chess!
Joey  Nice move.
Phoebe  Yeah.
Rachel  (entering) Hey!
Joey  Hey!
Phoebe  Hey!
Rachel  So Joey I just hooked Ross and Chandler up with some tuxedos for the
wedding, do you need one?
Joey  No, Im performing the ceremony. Im not wearing a tux.
Rachel  Well, what are you going to wear?
Joey  Multi-colored robes! Ooh, and maybe a hat.
Rachel  Huh. Does Monica know about this?
Joey  I dont think so.
Rachel  Can I please be there when you tell her? (Joey nods yes.)
Phoebe  Hey oh, Rach wait! Do you want to go to a movie tonight?
Rachel  Oh, yknow what? I cant. I have to have dinner with that
Melissa girl.
Joey  (excitedly) Can I come?! I wont even talk! Youll just hear the
noise from my video camera.
Phoebe  What is this? Whats going on?
Joey  Oh good! Can I tell her?! Can I tell her?!
Rachel  Well, do you want to hear what actually happened or Joeys lewd
version?
Phoebe  Joeys!
Joey  Okay
Rachel  Hey, come on! I had this friend from college and I made the stupid
mistake of telling Joey that one timeshe and I yknowkissed a little bit.
Phoebe  (laughs) Yeah, Im sure that happened.
Rachel  It-it did!
Phoebe  Sure!
Joey  Hey. (Laughs then seriously) It happened!
Rachel  Yeah, it was senior year in college. It was after the Sigma Chi luau and
Melissa and I got very drunk! And we ended up kissing! For several minutes!
Phoebe  (To Joey) Which means she had a couple spritzers and a quick peck on the
cheek.
Joey  Why are you taking this away from me?
Rachel  Yeah, why is it so hard for you to believe?!
Phoebe  Okay! I justI didnt know that you are a lesbian. (Joey
smiles and nods lewdly.)
Rachel  Im not saying that Im a lesbian! Im just saying that
this happened!
Phoebe  Okay, it just seems pretty wild and youre soyknow
sovanilla.
Rachel  (shocked) Vanilla?!
Phoebe  Yeah.
Rachel  Im not vanilla! Ive done lots of crazy things! I mean I
got-I got drunk and married in Vegas!
Phoebe  To Ross.
Rachel  All right, yknow what? If you dont want to believe me about
this, why dont you just come with me to dinner tonight and she will tell you.
Phoebe  Okay! All right! Yeah! Cause I just cant picture it.
Joey  Oh-ho, you should get inside my head.
[Scene  Central Perk, Chandler is on the couch reading as Ross enters carrying a
garment bag.]
Ross  Hey! Guess what I got for your wedding! (Holding up his garment bag.)
Chandler  A freakish thin date with a hanger for her head?
Ross  No. Rachel hooked me up with a tux! But not just any tux, Batmans
tux!
Chandler  What?
Ross  Thats right! Made expressly for Val Kilmer and worn by him in the
hit filmthat Batman film he was in.
Chandler  You cant wear that! Im wearing the famous tux! James
Bonds tux!
Ross  So?
Chandler  SoIf you wear that youll make mine less special.
Ross  Well, you need something to make this day special? Hello! You-you-you have
the most special thing of all! You are marrying the woman you love.
Chandler  Please, dont take away my cool thing. Please?! Pretty please?!
Ross  Pretty please? Not very uh, 007.
Chandler  Look, its my wedding day okay? If you were getting married I
would never do anything to upset you.
Ross  When I got married you slept with my sister.
Chandler  That was pretty 007.
[Scene  Monica and Chandler's, Monica is still working on the seating chart as Joey
enters.]
Joey  Hey.
Monica  Hey. Oh good-good youre here! All right, I figured it out.
Im gonna take two tables of eight, Im gonna add your parents, and Im
gonna turn them into three tables of six. Okay? And I called the caterer; I added two
extra meals, we are good to go!
Joey  Yeah, theyre not coming.
Monica  (looking at him) What?!
Joey  Somehow they got the idea that you only invited them because of me.
Theyfeel a little unwanted.
Monica  Oh thats too bad. Its true, but too bad.
Joey  Look Mon, if you could just call my mom
Monica  Oh Joey!
Joey  Come on! Look just-just telllet her know that you really want them
to be there. Lets not forget, this is a woman that has sent you many lasagnas over
the years.
Monica  No she hasnt.
Joey  Is it her fault that some of them didnt make it to you?
Monica  Well, what am I going to say?
Joey  I dont know. Just uh, just tell em it was a mix-up with the
invitations, orNo-no-no! Blame it on the post office. They hate the post
office. And the Irish! But I dont think you can blame it on them so (He dials
the phone and hands it to Monica.)
Monica  (on phone) Hello? (Listens) Yeah, hi! Mrs. Tribbiani? (Listens) Hi, this
is Monica Geller. (Listens) Yeah Im just calling to say that Chandler and I uh,
really hope you can make it to the wedding. Yeah, apparently a bunch of invitations that
we sent werent delivered. Umm, I guess there was some screw up at the damn post
office! (Joey nods his approval.) (Listens) T-Tell me about it! (Listens) Yeah, yeah, the
US Post Office? No, more like US lost office! (Listens) What are they Irish?! (Joey gives
her a thumbs up.)
[Scene  A restaurant, Melissa, Rachel, and Phoebe are talking.]
Melissa  anyway, his name is Allan and weve been going out for three
years. He was my first client when I became a party planner. He was planning a party for
his girlfriend at the time. Oh well. (Rachel and Phoebe politely laugh) And he was Theta
Beta Pi at Syracuse.
Rachel  Oh. Oh, thats great!
Melissa  Hmm Phoebe, were you ever in a sorority?
Phoebe  Of course! Yeah, I was uh, umm Thigh Mega Tampon.
Melissa  What one?
Phoebe  Yeah! Yknow, we were really huge too, but then they had to shut us
down when Regina Philange died of alcohol poisoning.
Melissa  Oh, isnt a shame when one girl ruins it for the whole bunch?
(Phoebe agrees by grunting.)
Rachel  (changing the subject) Anyway, speaking of drinking too much. I was uh,
tellin Phoebe about that one crazy night after the Sigma Chi luau where you and I
uh, we made out.
Melissa  (shocked) What?
Rachel  Remember?! Wecome on both had the sarongs on, and we had the-the
coconut bikini tops
Melissa  Yeah?
Rachel  we went back the house and we got really silly and wewe made
out.
Melissa  Oh wow, Ray-ray I have no idea what youre talking about.
Phoebe  Really?!
[Scene  Monica and Chandler's, Monica is on the couch as Chandler disgustedly enters.]
Chandler  Ross is Batman!
Monica  Well, he did manage to keep his identity secret for a long time.
Chandler  Rachel got Ross the tuxedo that Val Kilmer wore in Batman. Okay Batman
is so much cooler than James Bond!
Monica  What are you talking about?! 007 has all those gadgets!
Chandler  Batman has a utility belt!
Monica  007 has a fancy car!
Chandler  Batman has the Batmobile!
Monica  007 gets all the ladies.
Chandler  Batman has Robin! (Pause) We get ESPN right?
Monica  How about you go put on your 007 tuxedo and Ill make you a nice
martini.
Chandler  Actually, I dont like martinis.
Monica  How about a Youhoo with a funny straw?
Chandler  Ooh, yum! (Runs into the bedroom.)
Joey  (entering) Hey.
Monica  Hey.
Monica  The show?!
Joey  Right. Right. The wedding, gotcha. But I mean, its gonna start a
little late right? I mean, weddings start late. Right?
Monica  Have you ever been to one of my weddings?
Joey  Ah. Yeah. Well look, the thing is its the same day as my
nieces christening and I really want my parents to be there in time to see me.
Cause my parts just in the beginning Im not even in the rest of the
showWedding!
Monica  The wedding starts at six.
Joey  Okay. Okay, I totally hear ya. Oo how about this? I vamp a little
til they get there?
Monica  Youll vamp?!
Joey  Yeah! Yeah yknow, like warm up the crowd. Ask em where
theyre from. Cause in Joey Tribbiani you get a minister and you get an
entertainer. Im a minis-tainer! (Rapping) There is no one better! There is no one
greater!
[Scene  The restaurant, continued from earlier.]
Rachel  How can you not remember us kissing?!
Melissa  I dont know. I dont remember a lot of things that never
happened.
Rachel  Wh Come on! Remember? We were on the sleeping porch! We
couldnt stop giggling? And our coconuts kept knockin together?
Phoebe  Oh, somewhere Joeys head is exploding.
Rachel  Yeahbut come onListen, Im sorry I dont want to
make you uncomfortable, but I told Phoebe that it happened and she doesnt believe
me.
Melissa  Im sorry Ray-ray. I mean if I thought it happened I would say it.
Maybe I passed out and you did stuff to me while I was sleeping.
Rachel  No!!
Phoebe  Rachel, its okay. You dont have to do this. I believe you.
All right? Okay, if-if you say that you kissed Melissa, then you kissed Melissa.
Rachel  Thank you Phoebe.
Melissa  She didnt.
Phoebe  I know.
[Scene  Monica and Chandler's, Monica and Chandler are working on the seating chart as
Ross enters carrying his tux around.]
Ross  Hey!
Monica  You just carry that around?
Ross  Yes. I find it to be something of a conversation piece.
Monica  Between you and
Ross  Gunther. (To Chandler) Hey-hey! Why dont we put them on? Yknow
get a picture of Batman and James Bond together.
Chandler  I would but mine doesnt fit. The pants are a little tight.
Monica  A little tight? I could see double-oh and seven in those pants.
Ross  Well that stinks. I was looking forward to us wearing our celebrity tuxes
together.
Chandler  Well, does that mean that youre not going to wearing yours?
Ross  What are you kidding? Its Batmans tux!!
Chandler  (standing up) Let me try it on!
Ross  Okay, but just the jacket. Double-oh and seven are not gettin in
there.
Chandler  (trying on the jacket) Okay. Holy double-vented comfort Batman! (Finds
something in the pocket) Whats this?
Ross  What?
Chandler  An invitation for the At First Sight premiere? Oh my God! Val
Kilmer didnt wear this in Batman! He wore it to the premiere of some tooty-fruity
love story where he played a blind guy!
Ross  Let me see that! (Grabs the invitation and reads it.) Oh man!
Chandler  The only superpower you have is a slightly heightened sense of smell.
(Hands him the jacket and walks away.)
Joey  (entering) Hey! Uh, Monica? Chandler? Can I talk to you guys for a second?
Monica  All right thats it, I give up! Whatever you want you can have it!
You wanna sing a song? You wanna do a dance? You want your mom stand at the Alter and
scream racial slurs? I dont care!
Joey  No! No, I-I just wanna thank you guys for what you did for my parents,
that was really sweet. Theyre so happy they get to be a part of your special day.
Monica  (defeated) Oh.
Chandler  Well, youre welcome. And tell them were really glad
theyre coming.
Joey  Okay. I will. Ohh! Check out what they got me to wear for the ceremony!
(Runs to his apartment and returns wearing a rather silly hat.) Huh? I wear it like this
when I marry you guys, and then this (He tilts it to the side of his head) is for party
time.
[Scene  Outside the restaurant, Melissa, Phoebe, and Rachel are emerging.]
Rachel  It happened! I am telling you it happened!
Melissa  Okay. (To Phoebe) Well, it was great meeting you. And uh Rachel, I-I
dont think Ill be calling you (hails a cab) because umm, yknow
youve gotten weird. (The cab pulls up.) Take care you guys.
Rachel  What?! Wait a minute! No wait a minute! (She does so.) Okay? Look, that
night was the one wild thing I have ever done in my entire life, and Im not
gonna let you take that away from me! Okay, so if you dont remember that, maybe
you will remember this! (She grabs Melissa and kisses her on the lips.)
Melissa  My God! You love me!
Rachel  (shocked) What?
Melissa  Of course I remember our kiss. I think about it all the time. I can
still hear the coconuts knockin together I (Phoebe is shocked.) I just
didnt want to tell you cause I didnt think that youd return my
love, and now that you have (Leans in to kiss Rachel.)
Rachel  (moving away) Whoa! Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa! Whoa! Whoa!
Melissa  Aww, look whos being suddenly shy. You cant tell me you
dont feel what I feel. Nobody can kiss that good and not mean it. (Goes in again.)
Rachel  (moves away again) I-I-I-Im justIm just a good kisser!
Melissa  (suddenly frightened) Shut up!
Rachel  Im sorry!
Melissa  (laughs) Oh you dont have to be (Laughs again) sorry.
ImIm obviously kidding. Im not in love with you. (To Phoebe)
Im not in love with her. I dont hear coconuts banging together. Yeah, I
dontpicture your face when I make love to my boyfriend. Anyway, I gotta go.
Ehkiss good-bye? (Rachel stares at her stunned.) No? Okay. (Hurries into the cab and
drives off.)
Rachel  Wow! I mean I had no idea that that was gonna
Rachel  What the hell was that?!
Phoebe  I just wanted to see what all the fuss was about.
Rachel  And?
Phoebe  Ive had better.
[Scene  Ralph Lauren, Rachel is hooking Chandler up with another tuxedo.]
Chandler  (yelling from the changing room) All right! I found one that fits!
Rachel  Well yknow what they say, the 23rd times the
charm. (Chandler enters.) Aww, look at you all handsome!
Chandler  Whose is it?
Rachel  Oh does it matter?! All that matters is that you look so handsome.
Chandler  Whose is it?
Rachel  I dont want to say.
Chandler  Oh, come on! I dont care! Come on! Whose is it?
Rachel  Diane Keeton.

[Scene  Monica and Chandler's, Monica is at the kitchen table and Chandler is in the
living room.]
Monica  Do you realize that four weeks from today were getting married?
Four weeks baby!! Four weeks!!!
Chandler  Do you realize you get louder each week?
Monica  Theres still so much to do. Have you written your vows yet?
Chandler  I figured Id buy those. Pat, Id like to buy a vow.
(Laughs)
Monica  Sweetie, you know I have no sense of humor when it comes to the wedding.
Chandler  Right. So uh, have you written yours yet?
Monica  No! But I know exactly what Im going to say.
Chandler  Do you happen to know what Im going to say?
Monica  (handing him a pad of paper and a pen) Lets just do it right now.
Okay? It wont be hard. Just say whats in your heart. (She goes back, sits
down, and starts feverishly writing.)
Chandler  (watching in her) (in his head) Look at her go! She must love me
more than I love her! Whats wrong with me? Ooh, dont open that door.
[Scene  Joey and Rachel's, Chandler is getting help writing his vows from Joey and
Ross.]
Chandler  (writing) Monica, there are no words (To Joey and Ross) There
are no words! This should not be this hard!
Joey  All right, uh (To Ross) Oh hey, youve done this before Ross,
well what did you say when you made up your vows?
Ross  Well with Carol, I promised never to love another woman until the day I
die. She made no such promise.
Chandler  Im so pathetic! Monica knows what she wants to say! You
shouldve seen her. Writing, writing, writing!
[Scene  Monica and Chandler's, Monica has hit a writers block as Rachel and
Phoebe enter.]
Rachel  Monica what?
Phoebe  What?!
Rachel  What is the emergency?!
Monica  You have to help me! Im supposed to be writing my vows and all I
have is this! (Shows them what shes been working on.)
Rachel  Well, I like the pretty little drawing of you in the wedding dress.
Monica  Thank you.
Phoebe  Yeah, except your breasts look kinda small. (Points.)
Monica  Those are my eyes! Those are my breasts. (Points.)
Phoebe  Oh! Yeah! (Monica glares at her.)
Ross  Well, why dont you just start with something simple. Like umm,
Monica from the moment I met you, I knew I loved you.
Chandler  Yeah, Im not sure I can do that.
Ross  ...everyone, this is Chandler!
Fat Monica  Hi, I'm Ross's little sister.
Chandler  (seeing her) Okay.
Rachel  Okay. Okay. Okay. Umm, maybe you can start with, "Chandler, even
though we were friends; there was a part of me that always knew I wanted more."
Chandler  All right, theres a nuclear holocaust, Im the last man on
Earth. Would you go out with me?
Monica  Ennnh.
Monica  Ooh, are we allowed to lie in the vows?!
Phoebe  Well maybe you dont talk about your feelings back then. Maybe you
just say something about yknow all the things that hes taught you. Like
(They all try to think about one example and dont succeed.) Or all the things you
taught him.
Monica  Now everybody knows the basic erogenous zones. (She starts labelling
them) You got one, two three, four (Chandler is shocked to find out theres more than
three), five, six, and seven!
Chandler  (shocked) There are seven?! (Points to one) Thats one?
Monica  Its kind of an important one!
Chandler  Oh, yknow-yknow what, I was looking at it upside down.
Rachel  Well, yknow, sometimes that helps. (She realises what that
couldve meant.)
Monica  All right. Umm, you could uh start out with a little 1, a 2, a 1-2-3, 3,
5, a 4, a 3-2, 2, a 2-4-6, 2-4-6, 4, (Rachel starts getting worked up) 2, 2, 4-7, 5-7,
6-7, 7 7..77-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7(mouths 7)! (They both lean back
on the couch satisfied.)
Joey  Oh, I got it! How about saying something like, "Monica
Chandler  (writing) Monica
Joey  "when I look back over our time together"
Chandler  (writes what Joey said and waits for him to go on) Yeah?
Joey  Well, I cant do everything! Look back over your time together.
Phoebe  Oh, look, twins. Hi, guys. Oh, cute, cute.
Monica  No fair. I don't even have one. How come they get two?
Chandler  You'll get one.
Monica  Oh yeah? When?
Chandler  All right. I'll tell you what. When we're 40, if neither one of us are
married, what do you say you and I get together and have one?
Monica  Why won't I be married when I'm 40?
Chandler  Oh, no, no. I just meant hypothetically.
Monica  Ok, hypothetically, why won't I be married when I'm 40?
Chandler  No, no, no.
Monica  What is it? Is there something fundamentally unmarriable about me?
Chandler  (trapped) Uh, uh.
Monica  Well?
Chandler  Dear God! This parachute is a knapsack! (throws himself over the back
of the chair he was sitting in)
Ross 
Monica 
Chandler  Nice try.
Monica  Wait, wait, wait! (She puts a Shriner's hat on the turkey.)
Chandler  Look, Monica
Monica  Look! (She puts a big, yellow pair of sunglasses on the bird.)
Chandler  This is not going to work.
Monica  I bet this will work! (She starts dancing and Chandler cracks up.)
Chandler  You are so great! I love you!
Monica  What?
Chandler  Nothing! I said, I said "You're so great" and then I just, I
just stopped talking!
Monica  You said you loved me! I can't believe this!
Chandler  No I didn't!
Monica  Yes, you did!
Chandler  No I didn't!
Monica  You love me!
Chandler  No I don't! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!
Chandler   Yknow I was thinking, what if I uh, unpack here?
Monica  Then all your stuff would be here.
Chandler  Well, what if all my stuff was here?
Monica  Then youd be going back and forth all the time, I mean it
doesnt make any sense.
Chandler  Okay. What if we lived together and you understand what Im
saying?
Monica  You wanted it to be a surprise.
Chandler  Oh my God.
Monica  Chandler In all my life I never thought I would be so lucky.
(Starting to cry.) As tofall in love with my bestmy best Theres a
reason why girls dont do this!
Chandler  Okay! (He joins her on one knee) Okay! Okay! I'll do it!  Oh God,
I thought (Starting to cry, pauses) Wait a minute, I-I can do this. (Pause) I
thought that it mattered what I said or where I said it. Then I realized the only thing
that matters is that you, (Pause) you make me happier than I ever thought I could be.
(Starting to cry again.) And if youll let me, I will spend the rest of my life
trying to make you feel the same way. (Pause as he gets out the ring.) Monica, will you
marry me?
Monica  Yes.
Joey  (yelling through the door) Can we come it yet?! Were dying out here!
Monica  Come in! Come in! (Joey, Rachel, and Phoebe burst through the door.)
Were engaged!!!
[Scene  Central Perk, Phoebe and Rachel are on the couch as Joey and Ross enter.]
Joey  Hey!
Ross  Hey!
Rachel  Hey!
Phoebe  Hey!
Rachel  Hey, what have you guys been up to?
Ross  Oh, we were helping Chandler write his vows, but he kicked us out because
Joey kept making inappropriate suggestions.
Joey  How is "Monica, I love your sweet ass," inappropriate?
Ross  Hows Monica coming along with her vows?
Phoebe  Well lets just say its shes lucky she has a sweet ass,
cause shes not so good at the writing.
Ross  I cant believe in four weeks theyre gonna be married!
Phoebe  Well lets just hope it works. Yknow nine out of ten
marriages end in divorce?
Ross  Phoebe thats not true.
Phoebe  Yeah, youre right. Hows the Mrs.?
Rachel  I cant believe theyve been together for three years.
Joey  (shocked) Has it been that long?!
Ross  Believe me, it seems like less because they hid it from us for so long.
Joey  Hey, it's me! I'm comin' in!
Chandler  I've had a very long, hard day.
Joey  Ahh, I'm gonna go get some chicken. Want some?
Chandler  Ahh, no thanks. No chicken, bye-bye then.
Joey  Okay.
Chandler  Are you okay? I'm so sorry, he wouldn't leave. He kept asking me about
chicken.
Monica  Chicken? I could eat some chicken.
Chandler  Hey Joe!
Chandler  Yeah, can I get a 3-piece, some cole slaw, some beans, and a Coke(Yelps
in pain as Monica grabs him underwater)Diet Coke.
Rachel  I dont know why they didnt just tell us.
Joey  I know! I mean its not like we werent cool about it.
Joey  (To Chandler) You?! (To Monica) And-and you?!
Monica  Yes, but you cannot tell anyone! No one knows!
Joey  How?! When?!
Chandler  It happened in London.
Joey  IN LONDON!!!
Chandler  The reason we didn't tell anyone was because we didn't want to make a
big deal out of it.
Joey  But it is a big deal!! I have to tell someone!
Chandler  No-no-no-no-no! You can't!
Monica  Please? Please?! We just don't want to deal with telling everyone, okay?
Just promise you won't tell.
Joey  All right! Man, this is unbelievable!
Monica  (on phone) I can't wait to be with you!  I'll just tell Rachel I'm
gonna be doing laundry for a couple of hours.
Chandler  (on phone) Laundry. Huh. Is that my new nickname? (Rachel is
absolutely stunned, she opens her mouth in absolute amazement.)
Monica  (on phone) Awww, y'know what your nickname is, Mr. Big
Rachel  Arghh!! (She quickly hangs up the phone and starts to pace around
wondering what to do.)
Phoebe  (looking out the window) Oh, look! There's Monica and Chandler! (Starts
yelling.) Hey! Hey, you guys! Hey! (Chandler and Monica start taking each other's clothes
off.) Ohh!! Ohh! Ahh-ahhh!!
Rachel  What?!
Phoebe  (screaming) Ahhh!! Chandler and Monica!! Chandler and Monica!!
Rachel  Oh my God!
Phoebe  CHANDLER AND MONICA!!!!
Rachel  OH MY GOD!!!
Phoebe  OH!! MY EYES!!! MY EYES!!!!
Rachel  Phoebe!! Phoebe!! It's okay!! It's okay!!
Phoebe  NO! THEY'RE DOING IT!!!
Rachel  I KNOW!! I KNOW!! I KNOW!
Phoebe  YOU KNOW?!!!
Rachel  Yes, I know! And Joey knows! But Ross doesn't know so you have to stop
screaming!!
Ross  (entering) What's going on?
Phoebe and Rachel 
Rachel  (trying to divert his attention from the window by jumping up and down)
HI!! Hi!
Ross  What?! What?!
Rachel  Nothing! Oh God, we're just so excited that you want to get this
apartment!
Ross  Actually, it looks really good. (Turns towards the window and now Phoebe
starts jumping to divert his attention.)
Phoebe  (Screaming incoherently.) Get in here!!! (Motions to join her and
Rachel.)
Phoebe  Okay, so now they know that you know and they don't know that Rachel
knows?
Joey  Yes, but y'know what? It doesn't matter who knows what. Now, enough of us
know that we can just tell them that we know! Then all the lying and the secrets would
finally be over!
Phoebe  Or, we could not tell them we know and have a little fun of our
own
Rachel  All right honey, we'd better go if we wanna catch that movie.
Monica  Bye!
All  Bye!
Phoebe  Bye Chandler! (She walks up to him.) (Quietly.) I miss you already. (She
pinches his butt.)
Chandler  (after they've left) Okay, did you see that?! With the inappropriate
and the pinching!!
Monica  Actually, I did!
Chandler  Okay, so now do you believe that she's attracted to me?
Monica  Ohhh, oh my God! Oh my God! She knows about us!
Chandler  Phoebe knows about us!
Joey  Well I didn't tell them!
Monica  Them?! Who's them?
Joey  Uhhh, Phoebe and Joey.
Monica  Joey!
Joey  And Rachel. I would've told you but they made me promise not to tell!
Monica  Oh man, they think they are so slick messing with us! But see
they don't know that we know that they know! So
Chandler  Ahh yes, the messers become the messies!
Phoebe  I'll have to get back to you on that. Okay, bye! (Hangs up.) Oh my God!
He wants me to come over and feel his bicep and more!
Rachel  Are you kidding?!
Phoebe  No!
Rachel  I can not believe he would do that to MonWhoa! (She stops suddenly
and slowly turns to point at Joey. Joey is avoiding her eyes.) Joey, do they know that we
know?
Joey  No.
Rachel  Joey!
Joey  They know you know.
Rachel  Ugh, I knew it! Oh I cannot believe those two!
Phoebe  God, they thought they can mess with us! They're trying to mess with
us?! They don't know that we know they know we know! (Joey just shakes his head.) Joey,
you can't say anything!
Joey  I couldn't even if I wanted too.
Chandler  Listen, this is totally getting out of hand! Okay? She wants me to put
lotion on her!
Monica  She's bluffing!
Chandler  Look, she's not backing down! She went like this! (He does a little
mimic of her dance.)
Phoebe  He's not backing down. He went to get lotion.
Joey  (entering the hall) Oh man! Aren't you guys done yet?!
Rachel  Joey look, just look at it this way, the sooner Phoebe breaks Chandler
the sooner this is all over and out in the open.
Joey  Ooh!
Rachel  Okay!
Joey  I like that! (To Phoebe) Oh, okay! Show him your bra! He's afraid of bras!
Can't work 'em! (He swiftly rips open the front of Phoebe's dress revealing her bra.)
Phoebe  Joey! (Examining the dress.) Wow, you didnt rip off any buttons.
Joey  It's not my first time.
Monica  You go back out there and you seduce her till she cracks!
Chandler  Okay, give me a second! (Pause) Did you clean up in here?
Monica  Of course.
Chandler  Oh, you're-you're going?
Phoebe  Umm, not without you, lover. (She slowly walks over to him and is
showcasing her bra.) So, this is my bra.
Chandler  (swallowing hard) It's very, very nice. Well, come here. I'm very
happy were gonna have all the sex.
Phoebe  You should be. I'm very bendy. (Pause) I'm gonna kiss you now.
Chandler  Not if I kiss you first.
Phoebe  Ooh.
Chandler  Well, I guess there's nothing left for us to do but-but kiss.
Phoebe  Here it comes. Our first kiss.
Chandler  Okay! Okay! Okay! You win! You win!! I can't have sex with ya!
Phoebe  And why not?!
Chandler  Because I'm in love with Monica!!
Phoebe  You're-you're what?!
Chandler  Love her! That's right, ILOVEHER!!! I love her!! (They
walk together and hug.) I love you, Monica.
Monica  I love you too Chandler. (They kiss.)
Phoebe  I justI thought you guys were doing it, I didn't know you were in
love!
Joey   So that's it! It's over! Everybody knows!
Monica  Well actually, Ross doesn't.
Chandler  Yes, and we'd appreciate it if no one told him yet.
Ross  (He notices something through the window.) No! No! Wh What are you
doing?!! (Dr. Ledbetter is slowly backing away.) GET OFF MY SISTER!!!!!!!!!!!!!
[Scene  Central Perk, Phoebe, Rachel, Joey and Ross are talking.]
Phoebe  Yknow, youre friends getting married, its gotta
change things.
Rachel  You really think it would be that different?
Phoebe  How could it not be? I mean pretty soon theyre gonna be having
kids, and then theyre just gonna be hanging out with other couples who have kids.
And then maybe theyre gonna have to leave the city to be near a Volvo
dealership.
Rachel  Well, things change.
Joey  I dont want them to move to a Volvo dealership!
Ross  Itll be okay Joe.
Joey  Im sorry, I justI like things the way they are.
Rachel  Hey, who's this little naked guy?
Ross  That little naked guy would be me.
Rachel  Aww, look at the little thing.
Ross  Yes, yes, fine, that is my penis. Can we be grown-ups now?
Chandler  Who are those people?
Ross  Got me.
Monica  Oh, that's Nana, right there in the middle. (Reads the back) 'Me and the
gang at Java Joe's'.
Rachel  Wow, Monica, you look just like your grandmother. How old was she there?
Monica  Let's see, 1939... yeah, 24, 25?
Ross  Looks like a fun gang. (They all look at each other and smile)
Joey  Ooh, look-look-look-look-look! I got Monica naked!
Ross  (looking) Nono, that would be me again.
Monica  Hey, you guys!
Phoebe  Hey.
Joey  Hey.
Chandler  Whats going on?
Rachel  Well, we were just talkin about you guys gettin married and
how great it is.
Joey  Yeah, you can get a Volvo. If thats what you really want.
Monica  Oh thats so sweet.
Chandler  So we both finished our vows.
Phoebe  Oh!
Joey  Hey!
Rachel  Oh, can we read them?
Monica  Yeah, I dont hear Chandlers and he doesnt hear mine.
Rachel  Okay.
Phoebe  Okay.
Phoebe  (To Monica) Oh, thats beautiful.
Joey  (To Chandler) (laughing) Funny one! Thats good!
Rachel  (To Monica) Monica, will-will you marry me?
Joey  What? I dont get it.
Ross  (To Chandler) Oh man, this is hilarious.
Monica  Chandler!!
Chandler  Dont worry honey, well make yours funnier.
[Scene  Monica and Chandler's, Ross and Joey are reading Chandlers new vows.]
Chandler  Okay, what do you guys think?
Ross  (quietly) Dude!
Joey  (starting to cry) I have never known love like this.
Chandler  You really like it?
Ross  Dude! How-how did you write this?
Chandler  I stole Monicas and changed the name.
Ross  You cant do that!
Joey  If he goes first he can!

[Scene  Monica and Chandler's, Phoebe, Monica, and Rachel are sitting around the
kitchen table as Ross enters.]
Ross  Hey!
Monica  Hey!
Ross  Hey uh Mon, I saw the Porsche parked out front, can I get the keys?
Thought Id take that bad boy out for a little spin.
Rachel  Wait a minute! (To Monica) You let Ross drive the Porsche and
when I ask you, you say youre the only one whos allowed to drive it.
Monica  Yeah, well hes my brother! And plus he drives so slow he could
never hurt it.
Ross  Its a car Monica! Not a rocket ship!
Monica  Whatever Ross! Just replace the bulbs in the brake lights after
youre done.
Joey  (entering) Hey!
Ross  Hey!
Phoebe  Hey!
Joey  Saw the Porsche out there Mon, lookin good. When do I get to take
that baby out again?
Rachel  (shocked) You let Joey drive it?!
Phoebe  Ive never driven it! Okay? Not once! Okay once. Okay, I drive it
all the time.
Monica  Nice work everybody! So much for the yknow, "You can drive
it, but dont tell Rachel" plan!
Rachel  Wow! I cant believe you lied to me.
Phoebe  Okay, I can fix this! Okay Monica, Rachel thinks all you can talk about
is the wedding. (Rachel glares at her.)
Monica  Great! Well Rachel, the reason why I wont let you drive the
Porsche is because youre a terrible driver. There! That wasnt about the
wedding.
Ross  Look Rach if-if you want to go for a ride in the Porsche Ill be glad
to take you for a quick spin around the block.
Joey  Yeah, you got a couple hours?
[Scene  Central Perk, Rachel is there as Ross enters with his all his hair sticking
straight up.]
Ross  Whew! That was a brisk ride!
Rachel  Take the top down did ya?
Ross  Only way to fly.
Rachel  Come on Ross give me the keys! Monica does not know what
shes talking about! I am an excellent driver!
Ross  Youre fast and irresponsible. That adds up to a bad driver.
Rachel  Well in High School, that added up to head cheerleader.
Ross  Did you see the look that girl just gave me? Huh? She mustve seen me
cruising in the bad boy.
Rachel  I think shes checking out your beehive Ross.
Ross  What?! (Checks his hair.) Give-give me a brush.
Rachel  Gimme the keys!
Ross  No way!
Rachel  Well no brush!
Ross  Fine! Yknow what? It doesnt matter, because, if I remember
correctly, there is a comb on the floor of the bathroom.
Rachel  (to the woman) Alimony. (Runs outside.)
[Scene  Monica and Chandler's, Monica and Phoebe are counting the invitations as
Chandler exits from the bathroom.]
Monica  Chandler, we still havent gotten an RSVP from your dad.
Chandler  Oh! Right. Umm, maybe thats because I didnt send him an
invitation.
Monica  Chandler! Hes your father; he should be at the wedding.
Chandler  I dont even know the man. Okay? Were not the close. I
havent seen him in years.
Monica  Well what are you gonna do when he finds out he wasnt even asked?!
Chandler  Well he doesnt have to know! Its not like we run in the
same circles. I hang out with you guys, and he stars in a drag show in Vegas.
Phoebe  Ooh, I think I wanna trade circles.
Chandler  Trust me, you dont want him there either. Okay? Nobody is gonna
be staring at the bride when the father of the groom is wearing a back-less dress.
Monica  So what! As long as hes not wearing a white dress and a veil I
dont care.
Phoebe  Okay, I think I need to do some shopping. (Gets up and leaves.)
[Scene  A Street, Rachel is throwing her coat into the Porsche and getting in.]
Rachel  Ahhh! (Gets in.) Ooh, nice!
Rachel  My God!
Ross  What do you think youre doing?!
Rachel  Just washing the windshield. (She turns on the wipers forcing Ross off
of the hood.)
Ross  There is no way I am letting you drive this car! So why dont
you just hand over the keys?
Rachel  Oh.
{Transcribers Note  She puts the key into the ignition, which is on the left side
of the steering wheel. Does anyone know why that is? Its a tradition left over from
Porsches racing history. The worlds greatest endurance race is the 24 Hours of
LeMans. Which is in France and runs for 24 hours straight from noon on Saturday through
the dark of night and finishes at noon on Sunday.  In the 60s LeMans had a unique
start where the drivers would actually start the race outside of the car and across the
track. At the start of the race, the drivers would run across the track, get in the car,
buckle up, start the car, and drive off. Porsche wanted to reduce the amount of time that
took. Since all cars to that point had the ignition switches on the right side of the
steering wheel, that required the drivers to use their right hand to grab the seat-belts,
put the car in gear and start it. The drivers left hand did nothing. Porsche in
order to save a few seconds in a 24-hour race; moved the ignition switches to the left
side of the steering wheel so that the driver could start the car with his left hand while
grabbing the seat-belts with his right hand. Thats why every Porsche car built since
then has the ignition on the left side of the steering wheel.}
Ross  No ah-ah-ah! Do not start this car! (She starts the car.) Okay!
Okay! I will give you twenty bucks if you get out of this car right now! (He looks for the
twenty Rachel stole and doesnt find it.)
Rachel  Look Ross, if youre so freaked out, just get in the car!
Ross  With you?! Yeah right!
Rachel  All right. (She starts off.)
Ross  (grabbing the car) Okay! Okay! Okay! (He gets in, but into the back seat.)
Rachel  What are you doing?! Get in the front!
Ross  In the death seat?!!
Rachel  Oh my
[Scene  Central Perk, Joey and Phoebe are on the couch as a man enters.]
Man  Hey guys!
Joey  Hey!
Phoebe  Hey sweetie!
Man  Ready to go?
Phoebe  Yeah! Sure! Ooh, I left my purse up at Monicas. Ill be right
back. (She goes to get it.)
Man  (stopping her) Wait a minute!
Phoebe  What? (He leans in to kiss her.) Oh. (They kiss and Phoebe pauses.) Ooh.
(Pause) Whoa! That one kept going. (Exits.)
Joey  So! You and Phoebe huh? How long have you been going out?
Man  Over a month.
Joey  Wow! Maybe uh, maybe you and I ought to get to know each other a little
better.
Man  Sure, Id like that.
Joey  So uh, whats your name?
Man  (laughs) Its Jake.
Joey  Joey. (They shake hands.) Hey Jake, do you like the Knicks?
Jake  Yeah, big fan.
Joey  Me too! Theres a game on Tuesday do you wanna go?
Jake  Yeah that would be great! Let me make sure Im not doing anything
Tuesday. (He bends over to open his bag, when he does so his pants slide down his butt
revealing a pink lace secret.)
[Scene  Monica and Chandler's, Monica is entering from the bedroom carrying two bags of
luggage.]
Monica  Here! (She sets a bag down in front of him.)
Chandler  Whats this?
Monica  Its your suitcase. Were going to Las Vegas.
Chandler  Are you serious?! I mean like eloping?! No more stupid wedding stuff?!
No more these flowers or these flowers or these flowersThink of the money well
save!! (Monica just looks at him.) Were not eloping. I love the flowers. Can our
wedding be bigger please?
Monica  Were going to Las Vegas to see your dad. Its time you two
talked, and I want to get to know my father-in-law.
Chandler  Yknow we already went over this and I won!
Monica  No you didnt. Oh and honey just so you know, now that youre
marrying me, you dont get to win anymore.
Chandler  Look forget it okay? I dont want to go. I dont want to see
him. I dont wanna.
Monica  Chandler, look I-I know that your dad embarrassed you. I know
Chandler  No-no all kids are embarrassed by their parents, youd
have to come up with a whole new word for what I went through. When I was in High School,
he used to come to all of my swim meets dressed as a different Hollywood starlet.
Yknow its hard enough to be fourteen. Youre skinny. Youre wearing
speedoesThat your mom promised that you would grow into! And you look up into the
stands and theres your dad cheering you on dressed as Carmen Miranda. We was wearing
a headdress with real fruit that he will later hand out to your friends as a
healthy snack!
Monica  Hey, the point is that he was at everyone of your swim meets and he was
there cheering you on! Okay? Thats a, thats a pretty great dad.
Chandler  He had sex with Mr. Girabaldi!
Monica  Whos Mr. Girabaldi?
Chandler  Does it matter?!
Monica  Chandler, youre not fourteen anymore. Okay? Maybe its time
that you let that stuff go. If your fathers not at your weddingyoure
gonna regret it for the rest of your life.
Chandler  Yeah o-okay, but Im just doing this for you.
Monica  Yes!
Chandler  So I really never get to win anymore?
Monica  How much did ever really win before?
[Scene  Central Perk, Phoebe is there as Joey enters.]
Joey  Pheebs!
Phoebe  Hey!
Joey  Listen, you know how uh, when youre wearing pants and you lean
forward I check out your underwear?
Phoebe  Yeah!
Joey  Well, when Jake did it I saw thathe was wearing womens
underwear!
Phoebe  I know. They were mine.
Joey  Oh. (Laughs.) No! No wait, thats weird!
Phoebe  No, its not! We were just goofing around and I dared him to try
them on.
Joey  Thats weird!
Phoebe  Im wearing his briefs right now.
Joey  Thatskinda hot.
Phoebe  I think so too. And that little flap? Great for holding my lipstick.
Joey  Yeah, I wouldnt know about that.
Phoebe  And! Yknow what Jake says? That womens underwear is actually
more comfortable. And he loves the way the silk feels against his skin.
Joey  Yeah well next thing you know, hell be telling you that your high
heels are good for his posture!
Phoebe  There is nothing wrong with Jake! Okay? He is all man! Im thinking
even more than you.
Joey  Oh yeah, he looked like a real lumberjack in those pink laceys.
Phoebe  Im just saying that only a man completely secure with his
masculinity could walk around in womens underwear! I dont think you could ever
do that.
Joey  Hey! I am secure with my masculinity.
Phoebe  Okay whatever.
Joey  Youve seen my huge stack of porn right? (Phoebe nods.)
[Scene  The Porsche, Rachel is driving along a highway and Ross has finally moved to
the death seat and is terrified.]
Rachel  God. I forgot how much I love driving. I have got to get my
license renewed.
Ross  (shocked) You dont have a valid drivers
licenseOkay that is it! Pull over right now!
Rachel  Oh Ross youre so tense! You just gotta relax okay? Just need to
relax all right? Just need to relax (She takes her hands off of the wheel.)
Ross  (grabbing the wheel) What-what are you doing?! Are youOkay
thats not funny! Just stop horsing around!
Rachel  I am not horsing around okay? I am Porsching around.
Rachel  Uh-oh. (She starts to pull over.)
Ross  Okay, stay calm. Nothing is going to happen to you, you are not in that
much trouble.
Rachel  Really? You think so?
Ross  I was talking to myself! Youre going down!
[Scene  Joey and Rachel's, Joey is walking from the bathroom to his bedroom and walks
past a pile of Rachels laundry, which just happens to include a selection of
panties. He stops, goes back to the basket, looks for Rachel, picks up a lavender thong,
and heads for his bedroom. However, he decides he doesnt like his selection and goes
back this time picking up a red low-cut silk brief and heads for his room, flexing along
the way to prove his masculinity.]
[Scene  Las Vegas, we have the typical glamour shots of Vegas and the strip before we
arrive at 4 Queens bar, where Chandler and Monica are sitting at a table waiting for the
show to start.
A Waiter in Drag  (to Chandler and Monica) Has someone taken your order yet?
Monica  Uh oh yeah, she did. Uh, he did. (To Chandler) She? (To the waiter)
Im-Im sorry Im new. I dont
Waiter in Drag  (To Chandler) Hm-mmm?
Chandler  Yeah, I just ordered a beer! (Pounds the table.)
Waiter in Drag  Youre straight. I get it. (Walks away.)
Monica  I still say that if we had called your dad we coulda gotten better
seats.
Chandler  No! No! I dont want him to know were yet! Im not
sure Im ready for that. And besides hes not gonna be too happy to see me
either.
Monica  Why not?!
Chandler  I dont know if Ive told you this, but hes kinda
tried to get in contact with me a lot over the last few years
Monica  What?!
Chandler  Yeah, hes made phone calls, written letters, he even came to New
York, but I always said I was too busy to see him. Yknow its all very Cats
in the CradleI dont want to get into it. (The show starts.) Here we go.
Announcer 
Helena  Hello darlings.
Chandler  And theres daddy!
[Scene  The Porsche, they have pulled over and are awaiting the cop to come talk to
them.]
Rachel  Okay. Switch places with me! Switch places with me! Come on! Ill
go under, you go over!
Ross  Yeah, Ill get right on that.
Rachel  Oh come on Ross!! (She tries to switch places with him and goes under
his leg.)
Ross  No Rach! Come on! No-no! Yeah, Im sure we wont get arrested
for this.
Rachel  (sexily) Hi officer, was I going a little too fast?
Ross  Oh my God.
Policeman  Can I see your license please?
Rachel  Oh yes, absolutely! Yknow, its weird uh, but I had a dream
last night where I was stopped by a policeman. And then he uhwell I probably
shouldnt tell you the rest.
Policeman  Your license?
Rachel  (handing it to him) Yes. Here you go Officer uh, Handsome.
Policeman  Thats Hanson.
Rachel  Oops sorry, my mistake.
Ross  Dear Lord!!
Policeman  Wow!
Ross  Here it comes.
Policeman  This is a great picture.
Rachel  Really?! You think so? Yknow, I had just rolled out of bed.
Policeman  Yeah? Well you look phenomenal.
Ross  Well she should, it was taken ten years ago!
Rachel  Yknow youre-youre probably wondering about the old
date on there.
Policeman  Yes I am.
Rachel  Yeah.
Policeman  Youre an Aquarius, huh?
Rachel  I bet youre a Gemini.
Policeman  Nope.
Rachel  Taurus?
Policeman  Nope.
Rachel  Virgo?
Policeman  Nope.
Rachel  Sagittarius?
Policeman  Yep.
Rachel  I knew it! I knew it, ahh.
Policeman  Well I tell you what
Rachel  Yeah?
Policeman  Youre not gonna speed anymore right?
Rachel  I wont speed.
Policeman  And you promise youll get this taken care of right away?
Rachel  I promise.
Policeman  And in the meantime you better let him drive. Does he have a license?
Rachel  Yeah!
Policeman  Can he handle the stick?
Rachel  Oh well
Ross  I can handle the stick!!
[Scene  4 Queens Club, Helena Handbasket is singing.]
Helena  I feel pretty. Oh so pretty. I feel pretty and witty and(She
holds the mike out to the audience.)
All  Gay!
Monica  That cant be your father.
Chandler  Believe me, Ive been saying that for years. Oh my God!
Monica  What?
Chandler  Thats Mr. Girabaldi playing the piano.
Helena  (singing) For Im loved by a pretty wonderful boy!
(Applause.) Hello! And welcome to the show. I see some of our regulars in the audience.
And a couple of irregulars. (He starts going into the audience.)
Chandler  Hes coming into the audience. Hes coming into the
audience.
Monica  Relax! Youll be fine. (Chandler exhales and turns off the table
light.) Oh much better. Youre invisible now.
Helena  (standing at a table and asking the guy sitting there) Where are you
from?
Guy  Bakersfield.
Helena  Im sorry? (Holds out the mike.)
Guy  Bakersfield!
Helena  No-no I heard! Im just sorry.
Chandler  It cant happen like this. Okay? Ill meet you back at the
hotel.
Helena  (to Chandlers back) Oh look, a standing ovation already! So early
in the show. Oh turn around honey; let me see your pretty face. (He slowly turns around.
Helena recognizes him.)
Monica  Can we have our drinks please?! WaiterUh, tress!
[Scene  Central Perk, Phoebe is sitting on the couch as Joey enters strutting.]
Joey  Hey Pheebs! (He sits down next to her.)
Phoebe  Hey!
Joey  Check it out. (He turns around, pulls down his pants, and shows Phoebe
that hes got panties on.) How much of a man am I?!
Phoebe  Wow! Nice! Manly and also kind of a slut.
Joey  Yknow, Im beginning to see what Jake was talking about.
Phoebe  Uh-huh.
Joey  The silk? Feels really good!
Phoebe  Huh.
Joey  Yeah! And-and things arent assmashed down as I thought they
were gonna be.
Phoebe  Thats great Joe!
Joey  Yeah! And you have so many more choices than you do with
mens underwear!
Phoebe  Uh-huh.
Joey  Bikini, French cut, thong! And-and the fabrics! Youve got cotton,
silk, lace! And yknow what Ive always wondered about?
Phoebe  Hmm?
Joey  Pantyhose! Yknow? They way they start at your toe and go all the way
up to here (He mimed that and stops when he realized he went to far.) I should go
take these off shouldnt I?
Phoebe  I think its important that you do.
[Scene  4 Queens Club, scene continued from earlier.]
Helena  So whats your name?
Chandler  (resigning himself to his fate) Chandler. (He quickly sits down.)
Helena  Chandler? What an unusual name! You mustve had terribly fascinating
parents.
Chandler  Oh, theyre a hoot.
Helena  (To Monica) And who is your friend?
Monica  Im-Im Monica.
Helena  Monica! Where are you from?
Monica  New York.
Helena  Im not very fond of New York. Queens I like. (Noticing
Monicas ring.) Ooh, what is this sparkle something! (Shows the audience who
woos.) Honey! Huh?
Chandler  Actually Monica and I are engaged.
Helena  Really?! Congratulations. Whens the big day?
Monica  (looks at Chandler) Inin two weeks.
Helena  (disappointed) I see. Well, I wish you both a lifetime of
happiness. (To a bald guy.) So youre bald?
Chandler  Wait! Wait! Wed really love it if you could be there.
Helena  We? (Looks at Monica who nods.)
Chandler  I know it would make me happy, maam.
Helena  Well I wouldnt miss it for the world. Oh! Im getting all
misty here! Youd think I was having my legs waxed or something. (Goes back on
stage.)
Monica  (To Chandler) You okay?
Chandler  Yeah. Thanks for making me do this.
Helena  Before we go on with the show, I just want to say to the bride and groom
how lucky they are to have found each other. In every life, a little rain must fall.
Fortunately, in my life (Four guys wearing rubber boots, shorts, hats, and nothing
else carrying umbrellas run onto the stage.) (Singing) Its raining men!
The Chorus Line 
Helena  Its raining men!
The Chorus Line 
Chandler  (To Monica) When I was growing up Iplayed the one on the far
left.
[Scene  The Porsche, cars are whizzing by and honking their horns on both sides very
quickly as Ross creeps along.]
Rachel  Remind me to introduce you to someone!
Ross  Who?
Rachel  Fourth gear!!
Ross  What?! What does he want?! I wasnt doing anything!
Rachel  Well maybe he saw your hand slip briefly from the ten and two
oclock position.
Ross  Maybe its uh Sergeant Sagittarius coming back to flirt some more!
(They pull over.)
Rachel  Its a different guy!
Ross  Good evening officer.
Policeman  Do you know how fast you were traveling back there?
Ross  Ah no. I dont, but it could not have been more than sixty.
Policeman  Youre right. It was 37. (Rachel laughs.)
Ross  I mean youre not gonna give me a-a ticket for driving too slow are
ya?
Policeman  Thats right.
Ross  Yknow of-officer I uhI had the weirdest dream last night
Rachel  Oh my God!
Policeman  Your license please.
Ross  (laughs) You dont-you dont want to hear about my dream
OfficerPretty?
Policeman  Its Petty. (He grabs Rosss license.) Ill be right
back with your ticket. (Walks back to his car.)
Rachel  (pause) You have a son!
Ross  I know. I know.
[Scene  Central Perk, Joey is returning from having removed Rachels panties.]
Phoebe  Feel better?
Joey  Yeah! Much! Listen uh, not that Im yknow insecure about my
manhood or anything yknow, but I think I need to hook up with a woman like right
now.
Phoebe  Yeah, I understand.
Joey  Yeah! Okay! (He notices a beautiful woman sitting behind the couch and
goes to talk to her.) Hey! Hi!
Woman  Hi!
Joey  Yknow, you look familiar. Do I know you from somewhere?
Woman  I dont think so.
Joey  Oh! Maybe its because Im on television. Im an actor on Days
of Our Lives.
Woman  Wow!
Joey  Yeah.
Woman  Really?!
Joey  Hm-mmm.
Waitress  (to the woman) $4.50 please.
Joey  Oh, let me get this. (He takes out his wallet, but the panties come with
it. The woman and waitress are shocked.) (Realizing) (To the woman) These are for you.

Monica  Do you realize this is probably the last time well all be here in
the coffee house as six single people?
Phoebe  Why?! Whats happening to the coffee house?! (Monica looks at her.)
Oh! (Realizes.)
Chandler  Yep! From now on its gonna be the four of you guys and me and the
misses. The little woman. The wife. The old ball and chain.
Monica  Old?
Chandler  The young hot ball and chain.
Monica  Thats much better.
Rachel  (checking her watch) Op! We gotta go! (The girls stand up.)
Ross  Oh, where are you guys going?
Monica  Were gonna pick up the wedding dress then were gonna have
lunch with mom. (Joey stands up.)
Ross  Ah. Joey youre-youre having lunch with my mom?
Joey  No, I-I just heard lunch. But yeah, I can go. Sure! (They all exit.)
Ross  (To Chandler) Yknow what? Actually Im kinda glad theyre
leaving cause uh, I need to talk to you about something.
Chandler  Whats up?
Ross  Well this uh, this may be a little awkward.
Chandler  Listen, if you want to borrow money, its kind of a bad time. Im
buying dinner for 128 people tomorrow night.
Ross  No, itsIts not that. Umm, now what Im going to say to you,
Im not saying as your friend. Okay? Im-Im saying as it as
Monicas older brother.
Chandler  But youre still my friend?
Ross  Not for the next few minutes.
Chandler  During this timeare you, are you still my best man?
Ross  Nope.
Chandler  Do I still call you Ross?
Ross  Okay! You guys are getting married tomorrow and-and I couldnt be
more thrilled for both of you, but as Monicas older brother I-I have to tell you
this. If you ever hurt my little sister, if you ever cause her any unhappiness of any
kind, I will hunt you down, and kick your ass! (Chandler laughs.) What?
Im-Im-Im serious! (Chandler laughs harder.) ComeHey! Dude! Stop
it! Okay? Im-Im not kidding here!
Chandler  (smiling) Hey, I hear what your saying, okay? And, thanks for the
warning.
Ross  No problem.
Chandler  So are wefriends again?
Ross  Yeah.
Chandler  Okay. (Pause) You wont believe what Monicas older
brother just said to me!
[Scene  Monica and Chandler's, the girls are having breakfast.]
Rachel  What cha doing Mon?
Monica  Im making a list of all the things that are most likely to go
wrong at the wedding. Now, that way I can be prepared.
Phoebe  What are they?
Monica  Well, so far I have uh, my brides maids dresses wont get
picked up, my veil gets lost, or I dont have my something blue.
Rachel  Hey! Those are all the things Im responsible for!
Monica  I had to go with the odds Rach.
Joey  (entering) Hey! You guys! Remember that audition I had a while ago and
didnt get the part?
Rachel  The commercial?
Joey  No!
Phoebe  That play?
Joey  No!
Monica  That other play?
Joey  Nooo!
Phoebe  The movie?
Joey  Yes!!
Phoebe  Ohh!
Joey  Yes thats the one about the soldiers who fight in World War I!
Phoebe  Oh, yeah! Back then yknow, we called the Great War. It really was!
Joey  Well anyway, the guy they wanted backed out and now they want me! I start
shooting today!
Phoebe  Congratulations!
Rachel  Oh thats great!
Monica  Wait! Wait! Wait! You cant start today! Todays the rehearsal
dinner!
Joey  Oh no, Ill be done by then.
Monica  Oh. Well then way to go you big movie star!
Joey  I know! All right, Ill see you guys over there! Im off to
fight the Nazis.
Rachel  Oh, wait Joey! We fought the Nazis in World War II, not World War I.
Joey  Whoa! Okay. Yeah well, who-who was in World War I? (Rachel pauses as she
thinks.)
Phoebe  Go ahead.
Rachel  Youre gonna be late! Go! Go! (He runs out.)
Monica  Who did we fight in World War I?
Rachel  Mexico?
Phoebe  Yes! Very good.
[Scene  Pier 59 Studios, Joey is in costume and standing at the craft services table.
He checks his pockets and finds some prop coins in a pouch, which he replaces with some
cookies.]
The Assistant Director  (approaching) Hey Joey! Were ready.
Joey  Yeah! Me too. (He pats his pocket.)
The Assistant Director  (to another actor) Richard? Were ready for you.
(Richard approaches.) Joey Tribbiani? This is Richard Crosby hes playing Vincent.
Joey  Im doing my scenes with you?
Richard  Nice to meet you Joey.
Joey  Wow! I cant believe this! This is incredible. I mean you just won an
Oscar!
Richard  No I didnt.
Joey  I think you did.
Richard  I think I lost. Three times.
Joey  UhCookie?
The Director  (approaching) Okay! Were about an hour away from getting the
scene lit. So uh, if you guys dont mind, can we run it a couple of times?
Richard  Yeah, sure.
The Director  Okay, all right. Lets do it. (He walks off.)
AndAction!
Joey  We have to find the rest of the platoon!
Richard  Forget the platoon! The platoon is gone! (He is spitting on the hard Ps
and Ts.)
Joey  (wiping his face) What?!
Richard  (still spitting) The platoon is dead! Face facts Tony!
Joey  (wipes face) So what are we gonna do?! We have no reinforcements! No-no
food!
Richard  No, we still have food in the basement! I saw potatoes and some dry
pasta!
The Director  Hang on a minute! Joey, you keep touching your face. Is something
wrong?
Joey  (glances at Richard) No. Nope, I uhI thI thought it might be
kind of a cool character thing. Yknow? Hes uh, hes a face toucher.
(Behind his back, Richard is nodding no.)
The Director  I dont think so. Lets take it back to Richards
last line. (Walks off.) Action!
Richard  We may not have any weapons, but we still have food. In the basement I
saw potatoes and some dry pasta, and a few tins of tuna! (Joey backs away and wipes his
face again.)
[Scene  Monica and Chandler's, Monica is standing in the kitchen ready to leave for the
rehearsal dinner.]
Monica  Honey, we gotta go!
Chandler  (entering from the bedroom) Okay. Heres a question you never
have to ask. My dad just called and wanted to know if he could borrow one of your pearl
necklaces.
Monica  (laughs) I dont have anything like that, but let me go see if
Rachel does.
Chandler  Yes, include more people in this.
Monica  Hey, do you realize that at this time tomorrow well be getting
married?
Chandler  Wait a minute! I have a date tomorrow night.
Monica  I just, I cant believe that we made it!
Chandler  Well you dont have to sound so surprised.
Monica  Im sorry butnothing.
Chandler  What?
Monica  Wellhonestly ever since we got engaged I have been waiting for
something to, to flip you out.
Chandler  Honestly? Me too.
Monica  Really?
Chandler  Yeah. Yknow I keep thinking that something stupid is gonna come
up and Ill go allChandler. But nothing has.
Monica  Ohh, Im so glad. Thank you so much for staying so calm during
this. I mean its really, its made me stay calm. (Chandler just looks at her.)
I coulda been worse!
Chandler  Okay. Ill be right there.
Monica  (voice on answering machine) Hi! If youre calling before Saturday,
youve reached Monica and Chandler. But if youre calling after Saturday,
youve reached Mr. and Mrs. Bing! Please leave a message for the Bings!
[Scene  The Rehearsal Dinner, Chandler and Monica are greeting guests as they arrive. A
woman enters.]
Monica  Hey Maureen! (They hug.) Gosh! Hey uh, Chandler? This is my cousin
Maureen.
Chandler  Were the Bings.
Rachel  Hi! Oh you guys look so beautiful!
Chandler  Mr. and Mrs. Bing! (Walks away.)
Ross  (walks up) Wow Monica! Hey, just so you know I had my uh, older brother
chat with Chandler.
Monica  What is that?
Ross  Well II told him that if he ever hurt you I would hunt him down and
kick his ass! (The girls all laugh.) What?! What?! What is the matter with everybody?! I
am serious! I would kick his ass! (The laugh harder.)
Phoebe  Ross, please! My make-up! (He walks away angrily.)
Chandler  Hi.
Mrs. Bing  Chandler!
Chandler  Mom. Thanks for wearing something. (They hug.) (Shes wearing a
tight dress with a lot of cleavage showing.)
Mrs. Bing  Oh honey! This is so exciting! I thought we screwed you up so bad
this day would never come. Oh and just think. Soon therell be lots of little Bings.
(He freaks out and loosens the tie again.)
Monica  Mrs. Bing? Here, these are my parents umm, Judy and Jack Geller.
Mrs. Geller  (shaking her hand) Its lovely to meet you.
Mr. Geller  (shaking her hand) So are you his mother or his father?
Mrs. Geller  Jack!
Mr. Geller  What?! Ive never seen one before!
Monica  Dad! Theres Ross (points), why dont you go talk to him?
Mr. Geller  I didnt even have a chance to act as though Im okay with
it!
Mr. Bing  (entering) Hello all!
Chandler  Hidad.
Monica  Hi Mr.Bing.
Mr. Bing  Nora!
Mrs. Bing  Charles.
Monica  It-its so great to see you both here.
Mr. Bing  Yes! Although, I think we may be seeing a little too much of some
people. Arent you a little old to be wearing a dress like that?
Mrs. Bing  Dont you have a little too much penis to be wearing a dress
like that?
Chandler  Oh my God! (He and Monica walk away.)
Mr. Geller  of course you can kick his ass son.
Mrs. Geller  You could kick anyones ass you want too.
Ross  Thanks you guys. (Walks away happily and his parents smile.)
Monica  Oh, Rach! Rach! Umm hey, could you do me a favor and would talk to
Chandlers dad and try to keep him away from Chandlers mom?
Rachel  Yeah! But I dont know what he looks like!
Monica  He is the man in the black dress.
Rachel  Man in the black dress (Monica walks away and Rachel looks around
to find a woman in a black dress.) (To her) Hi! Im Rachel! Im a friend of
Monica and Chandlers!
Woman  Im Amanda.
Rachel  Oh I get it! Amanduh!
Ross  (clinking a wine glass) Can I have everyones attention please?
Im uh; Im Ross Geller.
Mr. Geller  Doctor Ross Geller.
Ross  Daddad, please! As I was saying umm, Im Dr. Ross Geller. Uhh,
and Im the best man. And uh, this marriage is doubly special for me umm, because not
only is the groom my best friend but uh, the bride is my little sister. And, shes
the greatest sister a guy could ask for. So if youd all please join me in raising a
glass to the, the couple were here to celebrate. (Everyone does so.) To the Bings.
All  To the Bings!
[Scene  Monica and Chandler's, Monica, Phoebe, and Rachel are in the kitchen.]
Monica  All right, Im gonna go steam my wedding dress okay? Who wants the
responsibility of making sure nothing happens to it?
Rachel  Ill do it.
Monica  Who wants it? Anybody?
Rachel  I said Ill do it!
Monica  Nobody wants to do it? All right, Ill do it myself.
Rachel  Monica! Im not gonna screw it up!
Monica  Yknow what? Youre right, Im sorry. Actually you were a
big help tonight. Yeah, and thanks for putting my grandmother in the cab and making sure
she got to the hotel safely.
Rachel  Well of course that is what Im here for!
Monica  Okay. Sorry. (Monica goes into the bathroom.)
Rachel  Ugh! (To Phoebe) What grandmother?
[Scene  Joey and Rachel's, Joey is wearing sunglasses and as he exits his bedroom, Ross
enters the apartment.]
Joey  Hey! Where have you been?
Ross  Oh, taking my parents back to the hotel.
Joey  Oh.
Ross  What? Are you going back to work?
Joey  Yeah.
Ross  Nice shades.
Joey  Thanks. Yeah, I figure if I wear these in my scenes at least I wont
get spit in the eyes, yknow?
Ross  And if I remember correctly, Ray Ban was the official sponsor of
World War I!
Joey  Great! All right. Ill see you later. (He starts to leave.)
Ross  Hey, wheres Chandler?
Joey  Uh, I think hes in Rachels room. See ya. (Exits.)
Ross  (going up to Rachels closed door) Chandler? (He opens the door and
looks inside and doesnt see him.) Chandler? (He checks the bathroom and still
doesnt find him. He then finds a note on the counter. He picks it up and reads it.)
[Scene  Monica and Chandler's, Phoebe and Rachel are in the kitchen as there is a knock
on the door. Rachel answers it.]
Ross  Hey!
Rachel  Hi!
Ross  Is uh, is Monica here?
Rachel  Shes steaming her dress, why? Whats up?
Ross  I think Chandlers gone. (He hands her the note.)
Rachel  What?!
Ross  He left that.
Rachel  (reading the note) Tell Monica Im sorry.
Phoebe  (walking up) Whats up? (Rachel hands her the note and she reads
it.) Tell Monica Im sorry. (Pause) Tell her yourself!
[Scene  The Hallway, Ross, Phoebe, and Rachel are discussing the note.]
Phoebe  Oh my God! Chandler just left though!
Rachel  Yeah but, maybe its not what we think. Maybe its tell Monica
Im sorry Idrank the last of the milk.
Phoebe  Or maybe he-he was writing to tell her that-that hes changed his
name, yknow? Tell Monica Im sorry.
Ross  I think it means he freaked out and left!
Phoebe  Dont be so negative! Good God! Isnt it possible that Sorry
is sitting in there (Joey and Rachels apartment) right now?!
Rachel  Okay. Phoebe, I-I think Ross is right. What are we gonna do?
Ross  LookOkay, Im just gonnaIm gonna have to go find
him and bring him back! Okay? You-you make sure Monica does not find out, okay?
Rachel  Okay.
Phoebe  (pointing at Ross) Okay but if you dont find him and bring
him back, I am gonna hunt you down and kick your ass!
Ross  (scared) I will, I will find him.
[Scene  The Movie Set, Joey is getting his make-up touched up as Richard approaches.]
Richard  Hey Joey, could you uh, go through these lines with me? (Hes
holding a script.)
Joey  Oh man! They-they just redid my make-up!
Richard  Just the last two pages.
Joey  All right.
Richard  I found the picture!
Joey  Picture? What picture?
Richard  Could you uh, could you lower your script? I need to see your face so I
can uh, play off your reaction.
Joey  Okay uh, look I know youre a great actor, okay? And you play all
those Shakespeare guys and stuff
Richard  Oh, thanks.
Joey  But youre spittin all over me man!
Richard  Well of course I am!
Joey  You know youve been spitting on me?!
Richard  Thats what real actors do! Annunciation is the mark of a good
actor! And when you enunciate, you spit! (Spits on the t)
Joey  (wiping face) Wow! Didnt know that.
Richard  Great!
Joey  Thanks! Okay-okay check it out! (Reading from the script) Picture? What
picture? (He pauses then spits) Eh?
[Scene  Central Perk, Gunther is behind the counter as Ross enters looking for
Chandler.]
Ross  Gunther have you uh, have you seen Chandler?
Gunther  No. No, I havent seen him.
Ross  Oh damn!
Gunther  Hes getting married tomorrow right?
Ross  Yes. Yes. Dont worry. Everythings fine. Well uh,
well see you tomorrow at the wedding.
Gunther  I wasnt invited.
Ross  Well then well-well see you the day after tomorrow. (Walks
away slowly, but notices something.) Mom?! Dad?! (Theyre sitting by the window.)
What-whatwhat you guys doing here?!
Mr. Geller  Well you kids talk about this place so much, we thought wed
see what all the fuss is about.
Mrs. Geller  I certainly see what the girls like coming here.
Ross  Why?!
Mrs. Geller  The sexy blonde behind the counter. (She waves at Gunther who waves
back.)
Ross  (shocked) Gunther?!
Mr. Geller  Your mother just added him to her list.
Ross  What? Your-your list?
Mrs. Geller  Yeah, the list thatof people were allowed to
sleep
Ross  Yes! No-no! I know, I know what the list is! Mom! Look if you see
Chandler, could you just let him know Im looking for him?
Mr. Geller  And if you see Rita Moreno, let her know Im looking for her.
[Scene  The Movie Set, Richard and Joey are doing a scene.]
The Director  Action!
Richard  I found the picture!
Joey  What picture?!
Richard  The picture of my wife! In your pack!
Joey  You went through my personal property?
Richard  Why do have a picture of Paulette in your pack?!
Joey  (pause) Because Vincent, we were lovers. (Pause) For two years!
The Director  Cut! Wonderful!
Joey  Great scene yeah?
Richard  Oh youre awesome! And, in that last speech? You soaked me.
Joey  Thanks a lot.
The Assistant Director  (To Joey) Heres your call sheet for tomorrow.
Joey  Oh, Im-Im not working tomorrow.
The Assistant Director  You are now.
Joey  No! No! I cant! You gotta get me out of it! Ive got plans!
(Spits.) Important plans! (Spits on the Ps.)
[Scene  Monica and Chandler's, the next morning, Rachel and Phoebe are eating
breakfast.]
Rachel  (closing the door) Ross said theres still no word from Chandler.
Phoebe  Oh man.
Rachel  Oh but he did say that they found the grandmother wandering down fifth
avenue.
Phoebe  Okay. Well theres one down.
Monica  (entering from her room, excitedly) Im getting married today!!!
(She trips and falls.) (Getting up) I think I just cracked a rib. But I dont care
because todays my wedding day! My day is finally here!! (Runs back into her room.)
Phoebe  Yknow she might not even notice hes gone.
Monica  (re-entering) Im gonna start getting ready! (Goes back into her
room.)
Rachel  God! DontWe cant let her start getting ready! This is
too awful! Oh God, but wait shell be in the gown and then he wont show up and
then shes gonna have to take off the gown
Phoebe  Shhh! Stop it! Stop it Rachel! You cant do this here! (She drags
her into the bathroom.)
Rachel  Im sorry. Im sorry. Its justIts just so
sad!
Phoebe  Yeah, but youve got to pull yourself together! Monica cant
see you like this! Then shell know somethings wrong!
Rachel  I know. I know. Oh God. (Looking around) Theres no tissue! Can you
grab me some toilet paper?
Phoebe  Yeah. (Looks.) Oh, thats gone too. This is Monicas
bathroom right?!
Rachel  Oh!
Phoebe  No-no! I-II found one.
Rachel  Okay.
Rachel  Oh thank you! (Wiping her nose.) Oh God! (She throws it out.) Can I have
another one?
Phoebe  (looking into the trash can) Sure. (Reaching into the trash can.) Do you
need some floss? (Grabs a piece of it.)
Rachel  Oh God I just can not imagine what is gonna happen if Chandler
doesnt show up!
Phoebe  Oh heres a whole bunch.
Rachel  Oh, I mean shes gonna be at the wedding waiting for him and people
will be whispering, "Oh that poor girl." Yknow? Then shell have to
come back here and live all alone.
Phoebe  (finding something interesting in the trash can) Oh my God!
Rachel  What?
Phoebe  There was a pregnancy test in the garbage, and its positive.
Monicas pregnant. (Rachel covers her mouth.) So I guess she wont be totally
alone.
[Scene  Monica and Chandlers bathroom, the scene is continued from earlier.]
Rachel  Oh my God!
Phoebe  I know! Monicas gonna have a baby! Hey, can this count as her
something new?
Rachel  Oh my God!
Phoebe  Hey, do you think this is why Chandler took off?
Rachel  No, she had to have just taken that test because I took out the trash
last night.
Phoebe  Oh God, this is turning into the worst wedding day ever! The bride is
pregnant. The groom is missing. And Im still holding this. (She throws the test back
into the trash.)
Rachel  Okay Phoebe, we can not tell anyone about this.
Phoebe  Right.
Rachel  Okay?
Phoebe  Yeah, okay. Hey, wait. Do you know what kind of birth control she was
using?
Rachel  No. Why?
Phoebe  Just for the future, this is hardly a commercial for it.
[Scene  Joey and Rachel's, Ross is just hanging up the phone as Rachel and Phoebe
enter.]
Rachel  Anything?
Ross  No! I talked to Joey on the set, he hasnt heard from him. I-I-I
talked to Chandlers parents again!
Phoebe  You told them he was missing?
Ross  No! I made it seem like I was just calling to chat. Pretty sure, they both
think Im interested in them.
Rachel  All right, weve got to tell her hes gone. (Starts to leave.)
Ross  No! Hey! Hey! We cant!
Rachel  Ross, shes gonna start getting ready soon!
Ross  Well, cant you at least stall her a little? Ill-Ill go
back to some of the places I went last night.
Rachel  All right, well how much time do you need?
Ross  Well how much time before she absolutely has to start getting ready?
Rachel  One hour.
Ross  Give me two.
Rachel  Then why do you ask?!
Ross  Okay, wish me luck.
Phoebe  Okay. Im going with you.
Ross  Why?!
Phoebe  Ross, youre tired. Youve been looking all night. And clearly
you suck at this.
Rachel  All right, Ill see you guys later.
Phoebe  Okay. Wait, do you know how youre going to stall her?
Rachel  Ill figure something out.
Phoebe  All right. Good luck.
Rachel  Thanks.
Monica  Hey! Okay, so I thought wed start with my make up and then do my
hair.
Rachel  Okay uh, but before you do that. I-I, I need you to talk to me.
Monica  About what?
Rachel  Umm Im never gonna getting married!
Monica  Yeah you will! The right guy is just around the corner! Okay, are we
done with that?
Rachel  No Monica! Im serious! Oh, maybe I should just forget about it.
Become a lesbian or something.
Monica  Any woman would be lucky to have ya.
Rachel  Well maybe it would make me feel better if I slept with Joey.
Monica  (jumping up) Rachel! You okay?
[Scene  The Movie Set, Joey is reporting for work.]
Joey  Excuse me, Aaron? (The director turns around.) Hi! Umm, I have a little
problem with the schedules. Originally, I wasnt supposed to work today, and I have
this wedding that I really have to be at. Its my best friends, and Im
officiating so I really cant work past four.
The Director  Joey, you gotta stay until the end. We cant stop filming
just for you. Its not like its your wedding. (Starts to walk away.)
Joey  Im having surgery!
The Director  What?!
Joey  Yeah, I-I just made up the stuff about the wedding because I didnt
want you to worry about me. But, Im having surgery today.
The Director  What kind of surgery?!
Joey  Transplant.
The Director  But youre supposed to work on Monday.
Joey  Hair transplant.
The Director  But youre not bald.
Joey  Its not on my head.
The Director  Look Joey, theres nothing I can do. Besides, youre
probably gonna be out by four anyway. Weve just got one short scene. Its just
you and Richard, and God knows hes a pro. Youll be fine. (Walks away and sees
Richard entering.) Morning Richard.
Joey  Hey! Youre here! Great! Great! Great! Lets get going buddy,
weve got a scene to shoot!
Richard  Im wearing two belts.
Joey  Are you drunk?
Richard  No!
Joey  Yes you are!
Richard  All right.
[Scene  A Street, Phoebe and Ross are exiting a pizza place.]
Ross  We are never gonna find him! Hes one guy in a huge city!
Phoebe  Oh my God! Is that him? (She points at someone.)
Ross  That is an old, Chinese woman!
Phoebe  He could be in disguise, yknow.
Ross  Aw, yknowYknow, maybe were-were just
approaching this all wrong. If youre Chandler and-and you wanna hide, where is the
last place on Earth people would think youd go?
Ross  So this is your office?
Chandler  How did you guys find me? I knew I shouldve hid at the gym!
Phoebe  What the hell are you doing?!
Chandler  Panicking! And using the Internet to try to prove that Im
related to Monica. How is she?
Ross  Shes fine. She doesnt know youre gone. And she
doesnt have to know, okay? Now come on, were going home.
Chandler  No! No! No! I cant do that!
Phoebe  Why not?!
Chandler  Because if I go home, were gonna become the Bings! I cant
be the Bings!
Ross  Whats wrong with being the Bings?
Chandler  The Bings have horrible marriages! They yell. They fight. And they use
the pool boy as a pawn in their sexual games!
Ross  Chandler, have you ever put on a black cocktail dress and asked me up to
your hotel room?
Chandler  No.
Ross  Then you are neither of your parents!
Chandler  Its not just their marriage! I mean, look at yours. Look at
everybodys! The only person that can make marriage work is Paul Newman! And
Ive met me; I am not Paul Newman. I dont race cars! I dont make popcorn!
None of my proceeds go to charity.
Phoebe  But look Chandler, right now, no one has a lower opinion of you than I
do. But I totally believe you can do this.
Chandler  I want to. I love her so much, but Im afrIts too
huge.
Ross  Yknow, okay. Youre right. It is huge. So why dont we
take it just a little bit at a time? Okay? Umm, forget getting married for a sec; just
forget about it. Can you just come home and take a shower?
Chandler  Well yeah, but then
Ross  (interrupting him) YeahNo-but-but-but-but! Were just gonna go
home and take a shower. Now, thats not scary right?
Chandler  Depends on what you mean by we.
[Scene  Monica and Chandler's, Rachel is still trying to stall Monica.]
Rachel  The nights are the hardest. (Checks her watch.) But then the day comes!
And thats every bit as hard as the night. And then the night comes again
Monica  (interrupting) The days and nights are hard! I get it! Okay? Look umm,
Rachel Im sorry! I have to start getting ready! Im getting married today!
Rachel  I know. At dusk. Thats such a hard time for me.
Monica  (getting up) Im gonna go put my make up on, we have to be at the
hotel in an hour! (Starts for the bathroom.)
Rachel  Okay. But wait!
Monica  What?!
Rachel  Lets go to lunch.
Monica  I cant go to lunch!!
Rachel  Right.
Rachel  Oh good God! Ive fallen down! (She trips and falls.)
Monica  (entering) Whats going on?
Rachel  Okay. All right. (Gets up.) Honey listen. When I tell you what Im
about to tell you, I need you to remember that we are all here for you and that we love
you.
Monica  Okay, youre-youre really freaking me out.
Rachel  We cant find Chandler(Phoebe sticks her head and motions
that they found Chandler)s vest. We cant find Chandlers vest.
Monica  How can that be?! Oh wait! Wait! Are you, are you serious?!
Phoebe  (entering) Found the vest! I mean were gonna have to keep an eye
on it, yknow make sure we dont lose it again
Rachel  Oh!
Monica  Oh wow! Okay. Dont scare me like that okay? I mean for a minute
there I was like, "Oh my God! The worst has happened!"
[Scene  The Movie Set, Joey and Richard are in the middle of a scene. They are both
holding swords.]
Joey  I would sooner die in this hellhole then see her back with you!
Richard  That can be arranged.
The Director  Lets reset.
Joey  What?! He got me! Owwwwww!!!
The Director  Lets take it from there.
Richard  (To Joey) Are you a little off today? Its going terribly slowly.
Joey  Look, my best friends are getting married in like an hour. Okay? And
Im the minister. Please! Please! Can you pull it together?
Richard  Of course! Im-Im sorry. I-Id hate you to miss
anything like that on account of me. I can do this!
Joey  Thank you. Thank you.
The Director  Still rolling, annnnd action!
Joey  I would sooner die in this hellhole then see her back with you!
Richard  Now, that can be arranged! (He brings his sword back and drops it,
causing it to fly over the wall.) Slippery little bugger!
[Scene  The Hotel, Monicas room, Mr. and Mrs. Bing are staring at each other
while Phoebe looks on.]
Phoebe  So-so you two were married huh? What happened? You just drift apart?
Mrs. Geller  Here comes the bride.
Phoebe  Oh my God Monica!
Monica  I wanna wear this everyday.
Rachel  You look so beautiful.
Monica  (starting to cry) Im so happy for me.
Rachel  Hello?
Joey  (on phone) Hey! Did Chandler show up yet?
Rachel  Yeah, we got him back. Everythings fine.
Joey  Damnit!
Rachel  What? Why? Where are you?
Joey  Im still on the set!
Rachel  Joey! The wedding is in less than an hour!
Joey  I know! Im sorry! The guys drunk, they wont let me go
until we get this.
Rachel  Oh my God! Im gonna have to find another minister.
Joey  No! No, Im the minister! All right, look-look, put em both on
the phone, Ill marry them right now.
Rachel  Ugh! Joey, I have to go.
Joey  Hey! Dont you hang up on me! Ill marry you and me right now! I
have the power!
[Scene  Chandlers Hotel Room, Ross is getting Chandler ready.]
Ross  There you go. You put on a tuxedo! Now that wasnt so scary, was it?
Chandler  No.
Ross  Im telling you, just a little bit at a time.
Chandler  Yeah okay. Well, whats the next little bit?
Ross  Getting married. (Chandler panics.) Okay. Okay. You can, you can do that
too! Just like youve done everything else!
Chandler  Yeah. Youre right. Hey I-I can do that.
Ross  Yeah.
Chandler  Okay, excuse me for a minute. (Starts to leave)
Ross  WhHeyWhoa-whoa, where, where you going?!
Chandler  Ross, I am not gonna run away again! I just want to get a little fresh
air.
Ross  Okay.
Chandler  Okay.
Chandler  Oh fresh air!
Phoebe  (To Rachel) Wait! Maybe, maybe youre overreacting! You do that
yknow.
Rachel  Well Phoebe, we gotta do something! (They turn the corner.) Well,
yknow. I mean theres no way Joeys gonna make it in time. So Im
gonna through the hotel and see if theres any other weddings going on.
Phoebe  Okay. Oh but dont tell them Monicas pregnant because, they
frown on that.
Rachel  Okay.
Phoebe  Okay.
[Scene  The Hotel, Rachel is walking through the ballroom area and comes upon the sign
for the Anastassakis/Papasifakis wedding.]
Rachel  Anastassakis/Papasifakis wedding, excellent! {Its a good thing
Jennifer Aniston is Greek, because she had to pronounce those names. Luckily for me, they
were written on a sign.}(The happy couple emerges.) Congratulations. (To the best man and
maid of honor) Mazel Tov! (The rabbi emerges.) Hi! Oh, great hat. (Hes wearing an
interesting hat and she takes him over to talk.) Listen umm, I need you to perform another
wedding. Can you do that?
The Rabbi  I dont know. Are they Greek Orthodox?
Rachel  Yeah! Yeah. Theyretheyre-theyre my friends, uh,
Monica Stephanopolus and uh, and Chandler Acidofolus.
[Scene  Monicas Hotel Room, Chandler and Monicas parents and Phoebe are
there as Ross enters.]
Ross  Hi! (To Mrs. Bing) Hi! (Mr. Bing starts rubbing his arm.) Hi. Has umm,
anyone seen Chandler?
Mr. Geller  I thought he was with you.
Ross  He-he was with me umm, were playing a little game, yknow? Hide
and seek.
Mr. Geller  You cant ask us son, thats cheating.
Ross  (pause) Youre right, thanks for keeping me honest dad.
Mrs. Geller  Well, he better not come by here. He cant see the bride in
the wedding dress.
Mrs. Bing  As I recall when we got married, I saw the groom in the wedding
dress.
Mr. Bing  But that was after the wedding, its not bad luck then.
Mrs. Bing  Honey, it isnt good luck.
Ross  Oh my God! Monica!
Monica  I know! Hey, hows Chandler doin?
Ross  Great. Hes doing great. Dont you worry about Chandler.
Monica  Are you okay?
Ross  Uh-huh.
Monica  Well, youre-youre sweating.
Ross  These-these are beads of joy.
Monica  Oh thats sweet. Dont touch me.
Ross  Uh Phoebe, can I see you for a second?
Phoebe  Yeah!
Phoebe  Whats going on?
Ross  Chandlers gone again!
Phoebe  Oh my God! Why would you play hide and seek with someone you know is a
flight risk?!
[Scene  The Movie Set, Joey is walking up to the director, pleading with him to let him
go.]
Joey  Aaron! You gotta let me go. The guys hammered!
The Director  Im sorry Joey, as long as hes here and hes
conscious were still shooting.
Richard  You wouldnt happen to have a very big fork?
Joey  So I uh, I just talked to the director. Thats it, were done
for the day.
Richard  Well have we finished the scene?
Joey  Yeah! Youyou were wonderful.
Richard  As were you.
Joey  So I got your car, its right outside.
Richard  Why? Are we done for the day?
Joey  Thats what you told me.
Richard  Oh, thank you. Youre welcome. (He stands up, staggers to the
couch, and starts to lie down.)
Joey  No-no-no! We gotta go! Come on! (Joey picks him up in a firemans
carry and carries him out.) Here we go.
Richard  Is that my ass? (Hes looking at Joeys.)
[Scene  The Hotel, Phoebe and Ross are looking for Chandler.]
Ross  (turning a corner) There he is!!
Chandler  What?
Phoebe  Hey! Oh!
Ross  Youre not getting away this time mister! Unless you want that ass
kicking we talked about!
Chandler  Ross! (He starts to get up.)
Ross  Hiiii-Ya!! (Chandler lies back down.) Im serious! Youre not
walking out on my sister!
Chandler  (standing up) Thats right! Im not!
Ross  Then where the hell have you been?!
Chandler  I know about Monica.
Phoebe  You know?!
Ross  What?
Chandler  Yeah, I heard you and Rachel talking.
Ross  What?! What?! Talking about what?!
Chandler  You dont know?
Ross  Know whatIf somebody doesnt tell me whats going on right
now
Phoebe  What? Youll hi-ya?
Chandler  Monicas pregnant.
Ross  Oh my God. Oh my God! And youre-youreyoure not
freaking out?
Chandler  Well I was! Then I went down to the gift shop because I was out of
cigarettes
Phoebe and Ross 
Chandler  Big picture please! So I was in the gift shop, and thats when I
uh, saw this. (He holds up a little, tiny baby jumper that reads I (heart) New York.)
Yeah, yknow what? I thought anything that can fit into this, cant be scary.
Phoebe  Well you obviously didnt see Chucky 3.
Chandler  But come on, look at how cute and small this is! So I got it to give
Monica so shed know I was okay.
Ross  Dude. (Hugs him.)
Mr. Geller  Way to go son! I knew youd find him!
[Scene  The moment we waited for has finally arrived. Its time for Monica and
Chandlers wedding. Weve got violins playing Every Breath You Take,
weve got guests seated, and Chandler starts walking down the aisle with his parents
on either arm.]
Mr. Bing  Our little boy is getting married.
Mrs. Bing  Oh look at you! So handsome!
Chandler  You look beautiful mom. (His dad clears his throat.) You look
beautiful too dad. I love you both. (He kisses his dad on the cheek) Im so glad you
here. (He kisses his mom.)
The Rabbi  Are you Chandler?
Chandler  Are you Joey?
Ross  Huh. This is nice.
Phoebe  What?
Ross  Ive never walked down the aisle knowing it cant end in
divorce.
Mrs. Geller  Oh I wish youre grandmother had lived to see this.
Monica  Shes right there.
Mrs. Geller  Not that old crow, my mother. (They stop and she kisses Monica on
the cheek.) Congratulations darling.
Mr. Geller  I love you sweetheart. (He kisses her and they sit down.)
Chandler  You look beautiful. Is this new? (Her dress.)
Monica  Not now.
Chandler  Okay.
Monica  (To Chandler) Who is this?
The Rabbi  I am Father Kalebasous.
Chandler  (in Monicas ear) Hes Greek Orthodox.
Rachel  (leaning in) As are you
The Rabbi  Let us begin. Dearly beloved
Joey  (entering) Thats my line! (He walks up the aisle and to the rabbi) I
can take it from here, thanks. (To all) Dearly beloved, Im sorry Im a little
late. You may be confused by this now, (Hes still in costume) but you wont be
Memorial Day weekend 2002. Well, lets get started before the groom takes off again.
Huh? (Monica is shocked and looks around.) We are gathered here today, to join this man
and this woman in the bonds of holy matrimony. Ive known Monica and Chandler for a
long time, and I can not imagine two people more perfect for each other. And now,
as Ive left my notes in my dressing room. We shall proceed to the vows. Monica?
Monica  (To Rachel) He took off?
Rachel  Go on! Go on. (She turns back to Chandler.)
Monica  Chandler, for so long II wondered if I would ever find my prince,
my soul mate. Then three years ago, at another wedding I turned to a friend for comfort.
And in stead, I found everything that Id ever been looking for my whole life. And
nowhere we arewith our future before usand I only want to spend it with
you, my prince, my soul mate, my friend. Unless you dont want to. You go!
Joey  Chandler?
Chandler  (To Ross) No, thats okay. (Ross nods and retreats.) Monica I
thought this was going to be the most difficult thing I ever gonna had to do. But when I
saw you walking down that aisle I realized how simple it was. I love you. Any surprises
that come our way its okay, because I will always love you. You are the person I was
meant to spend the rest of my life with. You wanna know if Im sure? (He leans in and
kisses her.)
Joey  You may not kiss the bride. So, I guess by the powers vested in my by the
state of New York and the Internet guys, I now pronounce you husband and wife. Oh wait! Do
you take each other?
Chandler  I do.
Monica  I do.
Joey  Yeah you do!
Ross  Rings?
Joey  Aw crap! Okayuhuh lets-lets do the rings.
Joey  We good? Yeah? Good? Once again, I pronounce you husband and wife. (To
Chandler) Now kiss her again.
Chandler  (To Monica) I love you. And I know about the baby.
Monica  What baby?
Chandler  Our baby.
Monica  We have a baby?
Chandler  Phoebe found your pregnancy test in the trash.
Monica  I didnt take a pregnancy test.
Chandler  Thenwho did?
Phoebe  Oh and theyre gonna have a baby.
Rachel  Uh-huh.
{Transcribers Note  There was no trailer for this episode. See you in season 8;
which will start this fall.}
Transcribers Note  This is stuff we never saw from all of the seasons, so for all
of the scene settings I will be using the current arrangements. Even though some of the
out takes take place when Chandler was living with Joey and Rachel was living with Monica,
when Joey and Chandler were living in Monica and Rachels, and the current
arrangements.
[Scene  Central Perk, the cast of Friends along with Conan OBrien are sitting and
talking.]
Jennifer  Once and a while.
Lisa  From time to time.
Conan  For example, I dont have to memorize lines. You guys actually have
to remember what to say and you probably forget from time to time. Yes?
Matthew  Our energy just comes way up when theres an audience here and
when that happens, something happens between your brain and your mouth sometimes and it
just doesnt, it just doesnt work.
Ross  Uh, oh-oh, umm no you didnt. I did.
Chandler  Oh uh-uh, no-no-no-no-uh-uh. (He starts laughing, causing everyone
else to laugh.)
Phoebe  So, we realize thatOh no (She resets herself) Im
telling it! Im telling it (She loses it.)
Joey  Ha-ha. LookCome on, I dont know what to door say. (He
laughs.)
Joey  Ha-ha, very funny. I dont know what to do! Yknow? Holy crud!
Joey  Ha-ha-ha, very funny. Look, I dont know what to do! (Long pause, as
everyone cracks up.)
Courtney  It is one of those days!
Phoebe  Xcusa seniora, voulez-bere quakay[Beep]uck it!
Matt  Wow Pheebs, you-you speak gutter?
Conan  You still get nervous everybody just before a show?
Matthew  Absolutely.
Lisa  Everybody.
Courtney  Its amazing like all week long weve-weve been saying
the same lines and then the audience is here and we will mess up, and if you mess up once,
then youll get nervous because youllyou know youll probably mess
up again.
The Director  Action!
Monica  (holding her hand in front of her face) When you were little you slept
through-through the Grand Canyon.
The Director  Watch again that hand.
Courtney  Thisll be five/ten takes.
The Director  Okay.
Courtney  Okay. You know its gonna happen.
The Director  Once again, and action!
Monica  (the hands still there) When-when you were little you slept
through the Grand Canyon. (She actually itches her nose this time.)
Courtney  Oh! Okay! Im gonna try it without the coffee cup cause I
think its the left hand thats messing me up.
Monica  When you were little you slept through the Grand(Pointing
again)Oh fffff.
Monica  Sorry, lets go back! Cause youve got more to say.
Lisa  Do I? Absolutely. Absolutely. Yeah, thats your fault. Isay.
Lisa  I love you.
Courtney  I love you! (They hug.)
Conan  But there must be, there mustare a lot of moments over the years
where youre just trying to do your job, something goes wrong.
Joey  Hey and, this is a little extra something for yknow, always being
there for me.
Matthew  Hey Joey! The camera hit our wall!
Matt  What?!
David  Ahh! Sh(Beep)it that hurt!
Jennifer  Are you okay?
Chandler  Hey Rach! (She breaks up and goes back into Monicas.)
Joey  Oh yeah? Then how come I keep(He notices that the marker board they
use has been left on the entertainment center and holds up his discovery.)
Monica  It was so wild! We told em we were the Gundersons in
16
Courtney  (laughing) I spit on her!
Jennifer  (to Lisa) Operation. You had a fun one.
Lisa  Oh yeah!
Jennifer  With Operation.
Conan  It was a little game. Yeah, with an electric buzzer.
Phoebe  Oh-ooh, and I brought Operation, but umm I lost the umm (It
starts buzzing) Its making a noise.
Lisa  But le Blanc really doesnt mess up much.
Conan  You dont verbally mess up, but sometimes physically? You mess up.
Matt  I have had some clumsy moments I guess you can call em.
Lisa  He fell down once! And we re-did it and we went back. And
he(laughs)he was afraid he was gonna fall down
Conan  You could actually see him trying not to fall down.
Joey  Pheebs! (He looks down as he goes down the step to make sure he
didnt fall again.) Check it out! (He starts laughing when he realized what he did.)
Courtney  This particular time when he continued to fall or yknow, try not
to fall, I was in the room with Matthew and Matthew was like, "Should I do it?"
Joey  Pheebs! Check it out! Check it out! Check it out! Check it out! (Hands her
one.)
Phoebe  Ooh, Soap Opera Digest!
Conan  Matthew, you have a reputation with the rest of the cast that sometimes
you like to, you like to fool around a bit. I mean like if somethings naturally
going wrong you like to get in there and juice it a little bit. True or false?
Matthew  I dont necessarily like to juice things
Courtney  He said true or false!
Joey  Oh! Ooh-ooh!
Monica  What are you doing?!
Joey  Youre still a tiny bit on fire there.
Monica  Oh geez! Okay! Thanks!
Richard  It was great seeing you the other night.
Monica  Well, it was good to see you too. Did you come down here to tell me
that?
Richard  Noo! I came down here to tell you something else. I came here
to tell you I still love you.
Chandler  What the fu(beep)ck are you doing?!
Conan  Now you guys work with animals a lot. You had to work early on with a
monkey
Jennifer  That damn monkey.
Conan  That damn monkey.
Rachel  Okay. Okay, see now the one with the feather boa? Thats Dr.
Francis. She used to be a man. Oh look! There(Marcel (Katie) jumps away)Okay.
(And runs behind her on the back of the couch for a little while.)
Jennifer  Katie. Geez! See Katie, come hereKatie! (Katie spills some
popcorn.) Katie, come here Katie. (She obeys and sits where shes supposed to.) Very
good.
Jennifer  Lisas laugh thoughTheresIts so
infectious. Its one of those thingsjust forget about it. Once it starts,
its all gone.
Rachel  No yknow, I dont want to switch! Come on! I can throw wet
paper towels here!
Phoebe  Well at Monicas you can eat(Suddenly cracks up.)
Lisa  Okay, shh yeah. Cause its not silly.
The Director  Here we go.
Jennifer  Okay.
The Director  Andaction!
Rachel  No-no Ph-Ph-Ph-Ph (She starts laughing.)
Jennifer  (to Lisa) Ready?
Lisa  Yeah.
Conan  And then it just builds on itself and theres no doing the scene
after. I mean you probably wait and really get it together and do it.
David  For me, I have a hard time with le Blanc in particular. When-whenI
mean when
Conan  (to Matt) You bastard.
Matt  Yeah, what did I do?
David  I keep a straight face he-he delivers like this look, a reaction to
you, or a certain take, I-II mean I find it so funny.
Joey  Mornin
Ross  Mornin
Joey  I mean what kind of an actor, what kind of an actor cant even say,
"Hmm, noodle soup?"
Matt  Thats a good one? (They both laugh.)
David  Now, we should go back and take the other line.
Matt  Okay, Ill just put a little more booze on there. (Pours some more
on.)
Ross  I think, subconsciously
Joey  (cracking up) Nope, you lost me.
David  No! Come on!
Joey  Okay, the next situation is for Rachel. The wedding is about to start you
walk into the back room and you find Monica taking a nap with Ross. (Ross lies on the
floor.) Ill be Monica. Go! (He jumps down and cuddles up with Ross.)
Ross  (jumping up) No! No! No!
Conan  Well be right back with more Friends, less me.
Courtney  Im doing my brother.
Matthew  Thatsgross.
Conan  You uh, youve worked withThey always say a performer should
never work with pets or children.
Jennifer  Aww, the kids.
The Director  Action.
Rachel  Okay. NowWhat is my first line?
Ben  (prompting her) What did we agree?
Jennifer  Okay
David  The good thing about the young kids though, theyre completely
unpredictable. Which is a lot of fun as an actor to respond with. But there was one
story
Jennifer  Oh little Ben.
David  Where the story was that I was anticipating that I would be around to
hear my sons first words spoken. But the scene was about that he wasnt
supposed to be able to speak and, uh for some reason when we started doing the show
Ross  Hi! Were visiting!
Rachel  Yay!
Ross  Its Ben and his Da-Da. Da-Da? Can you say Da-Da? Yknow, you
might as well say it because I told your
Ben  DaDa.
Ross  Can you say Da-Da? See, Im gonna tell your mommies you said it
anyway, so you might as well try
Ben  DaDa.
Ross  Huh?
Ben  DaDa.
David  Yeah, hes saying Da-Da.
Matt  And then sometimes during the show yknow but youre like, the
scenes going one way but youre just tempted to say something another time.
Like, do you remember that one where Monicas baking cookies in our old apartment?
Jennifer  Shes trying to intrigue us to hang out with her.
Matt  Yeah, shes trying to waft the smell across the hall to get us to
come hang out in her new place, and were sitting there eating pizza and I think it
was you (Points to Lisa) that said
Phoebe  What do I smell?
Matt  I think I was supposed to say, "I dont know," and go over
and open the door. And I went
Phoebe  What do I smell?
Joey  (Pause) Sorry. (Raises his hand in shame.)
Matt  (everyone laughs) And then it was like four takes later before we could
get through it with a straight face.
Phoebe  What do I smell?
David  Le Blanc.
Phoebe  What do I smell?
Joey  I dont know, but it smells good. (He gets up and heads for the door
only to stop short and start laughing.)
Conan  But audiencesYou have a live studio audience and they must love
that. They must love it when they see you guys playing.
Chandler  What are you guys doing?
Ross  Nothing.
Joey  Nothin.
Conan  So that you will intentionally do something
thattheyll-theyll intentionally screw it up?
Courtney  Yeah!
David  Yeah!
Matt  (noticing the laughter) Why? Whats the matter?
Conan  (to Courtney) You-youve worn a fat suit on the show. And, a lot of
people love you in the fat suit. Do you like wearing the fat suit? Is it fun?
Courtney  Im melting!
Courtney  They made me dance, in the fat suit.
Conan  I-I heard some of you guys talking about this earlier, but sometimes
theres just a word that someone has to say that youll get hung up on. And
itll justthe way you say the word is funny to everybody else.
Ross  That tastes like feet!
Matt  It tastes like (mimicking him in a high-pitched voice) feet!
David  Okay, were good.
The Director  Action!
Ross  That tastes like feet!
Matt  Sometimes the dialogue itself is just so funny and
youllwell be rehearsing during the week and you
justwhatever-whatever the joke is; its so funny we cant get through it
in rehearsal and just
Jennifer  You just know.
Matt  You-you mentally make a flag on it and you say, "Okay show night,
Im justIll never be able to get through this."
Monica  Are you saying that you dont want to get with this?
Chandler  You see, I dont say(Starts laughing.)
Phoebe  (spitting the cookie out onto a napkin) Oh, sweet
Je(Beep)sus! Oh! Monica, these are the (laughing) cookies they serve in hell!
Chandler  (noticing the woman on the screen) Whoa! Shes purty!
Joey  Oh yeah, and shes really nice too! She taught me about yknow,
how to work with the cameras and smell-the-fart acting.
Monica  Joey?
Rachel  Im sorry
Ross  Excuse me, what?
Conan  When you have to do physical business for a scene, I mean there must be;
there must be a lot of funny moments when you have to physically do a task as part of a
scene.
David  Yeah, Rachel, Chandler, and Ross had to try to get a couch up a
staira very narrow New York stairwell and that was probablyI-I think it was
the hardest Ive-Ive laughed in my life period.
Ross  Pivot! (They pivot) Pivot! (They pivot) Okay, pivot! Piv-at! (He starts
laughing.)
Ross  Pivot! Piv-at! Piv-at!!
Chandler  Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!!
David  Pivat!! (In a high pitched voice) Pivat!!!
Conan  Youve done over 150 episodes, but your favorite moments that 80
years from now youll be thinking about?
Matthew  It is when were able to crack each other up.
Chandler  Monicas gotta have the phone in the right place
and(Frantic babbling.)
Ross  (To Chandler) All right! All right! All right! (To Joey) We are
fixing it.
David  Hes gone. Hes
David  We enjoy watching each other. And I settle for watching each others
performance, and we like each other.
Ross  Oh the bands ready! And wellI-Iwe gotta do what the band
says, right? I dont care about the stinkin band!!
Conan  Okay Friends gang, thanks for doing it.
David  Well thank you so much.
Jennifer  Thank you Conan!
Matthew  Well thank for coming here, its good to see you.
Phoebe  Thank you my babies. (Waves good-bye.)
Monica  Oh what are doing?!
Joey  Youre still a tiny bit on fire there!
Monica  I think you got it!
Courtney  Im sorry, I messed up.
Matt  Ill do it again and again if you want.
Ross  No-no! Ill-Ill (He takes too much and some falls out of
his mouth, which starts him laughing.)
David  That is too much!
Matthew  Let me start that again.
