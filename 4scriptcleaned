Joey  (lying on a beach towel, recapping what happened in the last episode)
Okay, so we went to the beach, because Phoebe found out about this lady who knew her mom
and dad, and I dont really know what happened with that.
Phoebe Sr.  (to Phoebe) Im your mother.
Phoebe  Ehh?
Joey  (voice-over) Oh, and then Monica joked that she wouldnt go out with
a guy like Chandler...
Chandler  (to Monica) (in a funny voice) Hi there. (Monica turns her head away
in disgust)
Joey  (voice-over) ...and he couldnt let it go, and... I dont really
know what happened with that either.
Joey  (voice-over) Oh-oh! And then Rosss new girlfriend, Bonnie, shows up
and Rachel convinced her to save her head. And then Ross and Rachel kiss, and now Ross has
to choose between Rachel and the bald girl and I dont know what happened there
either...
Joey  Y'know what, hold on, let me go get Chandler. (gets up and leaves.)
[Scene  The beach house, its the same scene from the end of last year, with Ross
in front of the two doors of Rachels and Bonnies rooms, trying to decide which
door to choose. He finally chooses the one his right and goes in.]
Ross  (surprised) Hi!
Rachel and Bonnie  Hi!
Bonnie  Rachel was just helping me out. My head got all sunburned.
Ross  Awww.
Bonnie  (to Rachel) Thanks a million.
Rachel  Oh, youre welcome a million.
Bonnie  (getting up and leaving) (to Ross) Okay, Ill see you in our room.
Ross  Yeah. (closes the door, and goes over and kisses Rachel.)
Rachel  (softly) Oh my God.
Ross  I know.
Ross  (stopping suddenly and getting up) Okay, I gotta go.
Rachel  Whoa! What?! Why?!
Ross  Well, I-I gotta go break up with Bonnie.
Rachel  Here?! Now?!
Ross  Well, yeah. I cant-I cant stay here all night, and if I go in
there shes-shes gonna wanna... do stuff.
Rachel  Well, cant you tell her that you are not in the mood?
Ross  No, she likes that. Yeah. Faking sleep doesnt work either, I
cant tell you how many mornings I woke up with her...
Rachel  (interrupting) Whoa-ho.
Ross  Whoa-oh, okay! Yeah, why am I telling you that?
Rachel  I dont know.
Ross  Yeah, yeah. (opens the door) It wasnt every morning.
Rachel  Oh, making it worse!
Ross  Okay.
[Scene  Phoebe Sr.s house, its right after she told Phoebe that shes
her birth mother.]
Phoebe Sr.  So I guess youd like to know how it all happened.
Phoebe  I-I mean I, well I think I can figure it out. I guess y'know I was born,
and everyone started lying their asses off!
Phoebe Sr.  Noo! No! It wasnt like that I... Remember how I told you how
Lily, Frank, and I we were, we were close. Well, we were, we were very close.
Phoebe  How close?
Phoebe Sr.  Well, the-the three of us we were, kind of umm, a couple.
Phoebe  I dont even know how that would work!
Phoebe Sr.  Well, we were...
Phoebe  (interrupting) Im not asking!
Phoebe Sr.  Well, any how, some how I got pregnant, and, and I was scared. I was
stupid and sellfish, and I was 18 years old. I mean, you remember what its like to
be eighteen years old?
Phoebe  Yeah. Lets see, my had Mom killed herself, and my Dad had run off,
and I was living in a Gremlin with a guy named Cindy who talked to his hand.
Phoebe Sr.  Well, Im so sorry. I thought I was leaving you with the best
parents in the world, I didnt even hear about your Mom and Dad til a couple of years
ago, and by then you were already grown up. I dont know, youre here, and I
would, I would really, I would like to get to know you.
Phoebe  Yeah, well, everybody does! Im a really cool person. And y'know
you had 29 years to find that out, but you didnt even try! Y'know what, you walked
out on me, and Im just, Im gonna do the same thing to you.
Phoebe Sr.  Wait!
Phoebe  I dont ever want to see you again!
Phoebe  (walking back in with her hand over her eyes.) Umm, wheres my
purse?
[Scene  The beach house, Joey and Chandler are sitting at the dinner table, Monica is
looking in the fridge.]
Monica  (closing the fridge in disgust) Shoot! Were out of soda.
Chandler  (jumping up) Oh, Ill go out and get you some.
Monica  Really?!
Chandler  Nope! Because Im not your boyfriend. (to Phoebe, whos
entering) Hey Pheebs, how did it go?
Phoebe  Well, umm, my Moms friend, Phoebe, is actually my birth Mom.
Chandler  I found a dried up seashores.
Monica  Sweety, what are you talking about?
Phoebe  Oh, my new Mom, who-whos a big, fat abandoner! (starts to go
upstairs)
Joey  Whoa, wait, Pheebs, wait a second! Dont you wanna stay here and talk
about it?
Phoebe  No. Im just, I wanna, I need to be alone.
Phoebe  (turning around, insistently) Monica!
Monica  Oh.
[Scene  The beach house, Rachels bedroom. She is finishing up writing something
as Ross walks through the door.]
Ross  Its over.
Rachel  Oh, was it awful?
Ross  Well, it was loong. I didnt even realise how late it was, until I
noticed the 5 oclock shadow on her head. (They both start to laugh, then stop
themselves quickly.) Anyway, she didnt want to stay. I called a cab; she just left.
Rachel  I wrote you a letter.
Ross  Ohh! Thank you! I like mail. (He goes to kiss her again, but she turns
away.)
Rachel  (handing him the letter) Its just some things Ive been
thinking about. Some things about us, and before we can even think about the two of us
getting back together, I just need to know how you feel about this stuff.
Rachel  Well, Ill be waiting for you, just come up when youre done.
Ross  Okay, Ill be up in, (looks at the letter) 18 pages. Front and back.
Very exciting.
[Scene  The beach house, the next morning. Ross is passed out on the kitchen counter.
He wakes up with a start and has one of the pages of the letter stuck to his face.]
Ross  Oh. (looks at his watch) Oh-oh. (takes a drink of coffee and resumes
reading the letter)
Rachel  (coming down the stairs) Hey! (Ross jumps up, and quickly puts the
letter back together, pretending like he has just finished it.) What happened to you? Why
didnt you come up?
Ross  Done!
Rachel  You just finished?
Ross  Well, I wanted to be thorough. I mean this-this is clearly very, very
important to you, to us! And so I wanted to read every word carefully, twice!
Rachel  So umm, does it?
Ross  Im sorry.
Rachel  Does it?
Ross  Does it? Does it? Yeah, I wanted to give that whole Does it?
part just another glance.
Rachel  What are you talking about, Ross, you just said that you read it twice!
Look, y'know what, either it does or it doesnt, and if you have to even think
about it...
Ross  (interrupting) No, Rach, no. I dont, I dont, I dont have
to think about it, in fact, Ive decided, Ive decided that, that it.......does.
Rachel  Are you sure?
Ross  Oh, sure! Im sure.
Rachel  I know. (Hugs him more violently this time and pushes him back away from
the letter.)
[Scene  The beach. Chandler and Monica are out getting some sun.]
Chandler  All right, theres a nuclear holocaust, Im the last man on
Earth. Would you go out with me?
Monica  Ennnh.
Chandler  Ive got canned goods.
Joey  (jumping up in a hole that he is digging, he is shoulder deep) Hey, you
guys! Take a look at this! (Chandler and Monica jump up and go over to the hole.) Check
this baby out, dug me a hole!
Chandler  Excellent hole, Joe.
Joey  Oh no! No!! My hole!!
Monica  (screaming in pain) Ow!! Ow!!!
Joey  (climbing out of the hole) What?! What?!! What is it?!
Monica  Jellyfish sting! Oh, it hurts! It hurts!! It hurts!!
Chandler  Well, can we help?! You want us to take you back to the house?!
Monica  Its like two miles!
Joey  Yeah, and Im a little tired from digging the hole.
Monica  Oh damn the jellyfish. Damn all the jellyfish!
Chandler  Weve got to do something!
Joey  Well, theres really only one thing you can do.
Monica  What?! What is it?!
Joey  Youre gonna have to pee on it.
Monica  What?!! Gross!!
Joey  Dont blame me, I saw it on The Discovery Channel.
Chandler  Y'know what, hes right. Theres something like uh, ammonia
in that, that like kills the pain.
Monica  Well forget it! It doesnt hurt that (tries to take a step) baaad!!!!
Joey  If you want some privacy you can use my hole.
[Scene  The beach house, Phoebe is coming down the stairs all packed and ready to go.]
Phoebe  Well, Im ready to get the hell out of here! (Sees Ross and Rachel
cuddling on the couch.) Oh. Are you? Are you?!! (they nod Yes.) Ohh!
Thats so great!! Ooh, not for Bonnie. (they nod No.) But for you, yay!
Ohh.
Ross  Hey!
Rachel  How was the beach?
Monica  Nothing, I dont know.
Ross  What happened?
Monica  Nothing. Im gonna take a shower.
Chandler  Me too!!
Joey  Me too.
Phoebe  Okay, Im gonna put this (her suitcase) in the car.
Rachel  Ooh, I have to go pack. (Gets up to do so.) It really does?
Ross  It does. It really and truly does.
Ross  (finding the part) (looks up in disgust) It so does not!!!
[Scene  Central Perk, Ross is telling Joey and Chandler about the letter.]
Ross  She wants me to take responsibility for everything that went wrong
in our relationship. I mean she goes on for five pages about, about how I was unfaithful
to her! (Both Joey and Chandler shrug their shoulders as to say Well...)
(yelling) WE WERE ON A BREAK!!!!!
Chandler  Oh my God! If you say that one more time, Im gonna break
up with you!
Ross  Fine! Fine! But this break-up was not all my fault, and she, she says
here, (reading from the letter) If you accept full responsibility... (to
Chandler and Joey) Full responsibility! ...I can begin to trust you again. Does that
seem like something you can do. (yells at Joey) Does it?!!
Joey  No?
Chandler  Look, Ross, you have what you want, youre back with Rachel. If
you bring this up now youre gonna wreck the best thing that even happened to you.
Ross  (calming down) Yeah, I know. I mean, no, youre right. Yeah I guess
Ill let it go. But you-you understand how-how hard it is to forget about this.
Joey  Sure, its hard to forget! But that doesnt mean you have to
talk about it! A lot of things happened on that trip that we should never, (to Chandler)
ever talk about.
Ross  What the hell happened on that beach?!
Joey  Its between us and the sea, Ross!
[Scene  A hallway in an apartment building. Phoebe is knocks on a door and it opens.]
Phoebe  (to the person that answered the door) Hi, Ursula.
Ursula  Hey!
Phoebe  Okay, well umm, I know that we havent talked in a long time, but
umm okay, our Mom is not our birth Mom. This-this other lady is our birth Mom.
Ursula  Right, okay, the one that lives in Montuak, umm-hmm.
Phoebe  (shocked) You know her?!
Ursula  No, I umm, I read about her in Moms suicide note.
Phoebe  There-there was a suicide note?! (Ursula nods Yes.) Well, do
you still have it?
Ursula  (disgusted) Hang on. (She goes into her apartment and slams the door in
Phoebes face.)
Phoebe  I cant believe you didnt tell me there was a suicide note!
Ursula  Yeah. So how have you been doing?
Phoebe  I, umm, shut up!
Phoebe  (reading from the note) Good-bye Phoebe and Ursula. Ill miss
you. P.S. Your Mom lives in Montauk. You just wrote this!
Ursula  Well, its pretty much the gist. Well, except for the poem. You
read the poem, right?
Phoebe  Noooo!!
Ursula  All right, hang on! (She takes the note, goes back into her apartment
and slams the door shut.)
[Scene  Monica and Rachel's, Chandler, Monica, and Joey are sitting at the table eating
dinner and not talking. Ross and Rachel are outside cuddling on the balcony.]
Monica  Pass the cheese, please.
Monica  My God, you cant even look at me! Can you?
Joey  Nope.
Chandler  (jumping up) Hey! Phoebe! We can talk to Phoebe!!
Phoebe  No. Im-Im to depressed to talk.
Chandler  Ill give you a thousand dollars to talk to us.
Ross  (coming back in with Rachel) Hey, you guys! What do you, what do you think
about making that beach trip an annual thing?
Chandler, Monica, and Joey  NO!!!
Rachel  All right, thats it, you guys! What happened out there?
Monica  What? We took a walk, nothing happened. I can back with nothing all over
me.
Ross and Rachel  Come on!
Ross  What happened? Joey?
Joey  All right. (gets up)
Monica  (stopping him) No! Joey, we swore wed never tell!
Chandler  (running over and joining Monica) Theyll never understand!
Joey  Well, we have to say something! We have to get it out! Its eating me
alive!! Monica got stung by a jellyfish.
Monica  (interrupting) All right!! All right. (walks slowly into the living
room) I got stung. Stung bad. I couldnt stand. I-I couldnt walk.
Chandler  (following Monica) We were two miles from the house. Scared and alone.
We didnt think we could make it. (He goes to put his hands on Monicas
shoulders but for some reason can quite complete the action and pulls back.)
Monica  I was in too much pain.
Joey  And I was tired from digging the huge hole!
Chandler  And then Joey remembered something.
Joey  Id seen this thing on The Discovery Channel...
Ross  Wait a minute! I saw that! On The Discovery Channel, yeah! About
jellyfish and how if you... (stops suddenly and turns to look at Monica) Ewwww!! You peed
on yourself?!
Phoebe and Rachel  Ewwww!!
Monica  You cant say that!! You-you dont know!! I mean I thought I
was gonna pass out from the pain! Anyway I-I tried, but I-I couldnt...bend that way.
So... (looks at Joey.)
Phoebe, Ross, and Rachel  (turning to look at Joey) Ewwww!!
Joey  Thats right I stepped up! Shes my friend and she needed help!
And if I had too, Id pee on anyone of you! Only, uhh, I couldnt. I got the
stage fright. I wanted to help, but there was too much pressure. So-so I uh, I turned to
Chandler.
Chandler  (wails loudly into his hands) Joey kept screaming at me, Do it
now! Do it!! Do it! Do it now!! Sometimes late at night I can still here the
screaming.
Joey  (laughs) Thats cause sometimes I just do it through my wall to
freak you out.
[Scene  Central Perk, Phoebe is finishing up a song.]
Phoebe  (singing) ...fuchsia and mauvvve. Those are the 66 colours of my
bedroommmm. (applause) Thank you, thank you. Ohh, and I invite you to count the
colours in your bedroom. (Sees that Phoebe Sr. has entered, and to her) Except for you.
You go away.
Phoebe Sr.  Ill go in a second, I-I just wanted to tell you that there
hasnt been a day where I didnt regret giving you up.
Phoebe  Okay, bye.
Phoebe Sr.  No, Im not done. I-I-I just want you to know that I, the
reason I didnt look you up was, well I was afraid that youd react, just well
like, the way, the way youre reacting right now, and cant we just, y'know,
start from here?
Phoebe  No.
Phoebe Sr.  Sorry. But just one last thing. Y'know you came looking for family.
Im family, Im it. Now, now Im done. (starts to leave)
Phoebe  But, its not like were losing anything. Y'know?
Phoebe Sr.  Yeah, I guess youre right.
Phoebe  Its not like we-we know each other or anything. Or that have anything
in common.
Phoebe Sr.  Well, I dont know. I mean its not like we dont
have anything in common. I mean I like uh, pizza.
Phoebe  I-I like pizza!
Phoebe Sr.  You do?! Wait, I like umm, the Beetles.
Phoebe  Oh my God, so do I!
Phoebe Sr.  I knew it, wow!!
Phoebe  Wait-wait-wait, wait! Puppies. Cute or ugly?
Phoebe Sr.  Ohh, so cute.
Phoebe  Uh-huh, well! But umm, still Im-Im mad at you.
Phoebe Sr.  I know. Im mad at me too.
Phoebe  Well umm, do you wanna get something to eat? Im kinda hungry.
Phoebe Sr.  Hey! Me too!
Phoebe  All right, stop it. Now youre just doing it to freak me out.
[Scene  Rachels bedroom. Ross and Rachel have just finished consummating the new
relationship.]
Rachel  Oh-hooo, I missed you.
Ross  I missed you too.
Rachel  Ooh, I was soo nervous about that letter. But the way you owned up to
everything, it just showed me how much youve grown. Y'know?
Ross  (getting miffed) I suppose.
Rachel  You have! Ross, you should give yourself credit. I mean my Mom never
thought this would work out. It was all, Once a cheater, always a cheater.
Ross  (getting angry) Umm-hmm.
Rachel  Ooh, I just wish we hadnt lost those four months, but if time was
what you needed just to gain a little perspective...
Ross  (yelling from the bedroom) WE WERE ON A BREAK!!!!!!!
Chandler  (entering with Joey) (to Monica) Coffee house?
Monica  You bet.
Ross  And for the record, it took two people to break up this
relationship!!
Rachel  Yeah! You and that girl from that copy place, which yesterday you took
full responsibility for!!
Ross  I didnt know what I was taking full responsibility for! Okay?! I
didnt finish the whole letter!
Rachel  What?!!
Ross  I fell asleep!
Rachel  You fell asleep?!
Rachel  Y'know I cant believe I even thought about getting back
together again! We are so over!!
Ross  (starts to cry) FINE BY ME!! (he opens the door and traps Chandler behind
it)
Rachel  Oh, oh, and hey-hey-hey, those little spelling tips will come in handy
when youre at home on Saturday nights playing Scrabble with Monica!!
Monica  Hey!!
Rachel  (to Monica) Sorry!! (to Ross) I just feel bad about all that sleep
youre gonna miss wishing you were with me!
Ross  Oh, no-no-no dont you worry about me falling asleep. I still have
your letter!!!
Rachel  And hey! Just so you know, its not that common! It doesnt
happen to every guy! And it is a big deal!!
Chandler  I KNEW IT!!!!
[Scene  Monica and Rachel's, Chandler and Monica are playing cards at the dinner
table.]
Monica  (sets down some cards) Gin.
Chandler  We were playing Gin? Y'know if we were a couple, we could play this
game naked.
Monica  Will you stop!
Chandler  Okay. All right.
Monica  Okay, all right, I think youre great, I think youre sweet,
and youre smart, and I love you. But you will always be the guy who peed on me.
[Scene  Chandler and Joey's, Joey is eating breakfast as Chandler comes out of his
bedroom, ripping his coat in the process.]
Chandler  Wow! That ripped! That ripped real nice!
Joey  How many times do I have to tell you! Ya, turn and sliiiide! Y'know, turn
and slide.
Chandler  You dont turn and slide, you throw it out! Im tired of
having to get a tetanus shot every time I get dressed!
Joey  Look, were not throwing it out! I built this thing with my own
hands!
Chandler  All right, how about we, how bout we sell it.
Joey  All right. But, youre gonna have to tell them. (He opens the cabinet
to reveal the chick and the duck living inside with Christmas lights and a disco ball as
decorations.)
Chandler  (nods his head) Do you mind if we stick you in another cabinet? (to
Joey) They seem all right with it!
[Scene  Monica and Rachel's, Monica and Ross are there. Monica is
checking the messages.]
Chip  (on machine) Hey Monica, its Chip.
Monica  Yesss!!
Ross  Whos Chip?
Monica  Shhh!
Chip  (on machine) Good runnin into you at the bank today, so ah,
heres my number, 555-9323. Give me a call. Later.
Monica  Chip, is Chip Matthews.
Ross  The guy who took Rachel to the prom? Why is he calling you?
Monica  Cause I ran into him at the bank, he is still soo cute.
Ross  Monica, youre so lucky! Hes like the most popular guy in
school!!
Monica  I know!! (calls him) (on phone) Chip? Hi! Its Monica. (listens)
Kay. (listens) Kay. (listens) Okay. (listens) Okay, good-bye. (hangs up) Oh my
God, we just had the best conversation!! (goes into her room as Rachel enters)
Ross  (to Rachel) I was just leaving.
Rachel  Good! Cause Ive got a product report to read, its like
eight pages, I hope I dont fall asleep.
Ross  Why? Did you write it?
Rachel  (sees Chips phone number) Wow! Look at that, Chip Matthews called.
I wonder what he wants?
Ross  Well ah, actually...
Rachel  (interrupting) I bet he sensed that I was ready to have sex with another
guy.
Ross  Well, umm, why dont you give him a call?
Rachel  Okay. (picks up phone) Are you sure you wanna hear this?
Ross  Oh, Im sure.
Rachel  (on phone) Chip! Hi, its Rachel. (listens) Rachel Green. Yeah,
umm, you left me a message. (listens) Yes you did, my roommate wrote it down. (listens)
Monica Geller. (listens) Ohh.
Ross  (whispering in her ear) Oh, thats right! He called to ask out
Monica! That-thats gotta be embarrassing!
[Scene  Central Perk, Phoebe is finishing up a song.]
Phoebe  (screaming, angrily) ...DUMB, DRUNKEN, BITCH!!! (applause) (happily)
Thank you, thanks.
Ross  (reading the newspaper) Hey, heres a question; where did you guys
get the finest oak East of the Mississippi?
Chandler  Uh-huh, first you tell us where you got the prettiest lace in all the
land.
Ross  Im reading your ad.
Joey  Looks good, uh?
Ross  Yeah.
Chandler  (reading the ad) Stunning entertainment center. Fine, (pause) fine
Italian craftsmanship. (Joey is very proud of himself)
Phoebe  Oh my God, you guys are selling the entertainment center?
Rachel  Why? I love that thing.
Chandler  You want it?
Phoebe and Rachel  Oh no.
Chandler  Ahh, Gepeto, $5,000 dollars? Are you insane?
Joey  Hey, the ad alone cost 300 bucks!
Chandler  All right look, Im changing it to 50 bucks, or your best offer.
Joey  What kind of profit is that?! And you call yourself an accountant.
Chandler  (looks at him) Nooo.
Joey  Oh. What do you do?
Chandler  I cant believe you dont know what I do for a living!
Phoebe  Yeah, I actually dont know...
Ross  Good, so do I
Rachel  Something to do with numbers?
Phoebe  Oh my God! No! Shoo! Kitty! No! No-no-no! Shoo! Come on, you! (goes over
and picks up the cat) Come on. Crazy. (looks into the cats eyes) Oh my God.
Rachel  What?
Phoebe  Nothing. Nothing.
Joey  What? Whats wrong?
Phoebe  I just, I just have this really strong feeling that this cat is my
Mother.
Rachel  You mean the mom you met in Montauk. She was a cat?!
Phoebe  No, no-no, she was a human lady. This is the spirit of my Mom
Lily, the one who killed herself.
Ross  Are you sure shes in the cat, or have you been taking your
grandmas glycoma medicine again?
Phoebe  No Dr. Skeptismo! Im sure. First of all, okay, theres the
feeling. (Chandler shrugs) Okay, and for another, how about the fact that she went into my
guitar case which is lined with orange felt. (Rachel nods her head in unsure agreement) My
Mothers favourite fish is Orange Roughy... (Joey thinks he understands, but then
nods that he has no clue.) Cats....like....fish! (Ross and Rachel are totally lost) (to
the cat) Hi, Mommy. (Rachel covers her mouth, in an Oh my God. gesture) Oh, I
havent seen this smile in 17 years!
Joey  (to Chandler) Dude, Phoebes mom has got a huge peni...
Chandler  (interrupting) Let it go!!
[Scene  Monica and Rachel's, Rachel is working as Monica enters.]
Monica  Hey!
Rachel  Umm, when were you gonna tell me that youre going out with Chip
Matthews?
Monica  Now? Is it okay if I go out with Chip Matthews?
Rachel  Nooo! Its not okay! I cant believe you would want to after
what he did to me!
Monica  What, that little thing at the prom?
Rachel  Monica! I couldnt find him for two hours! He was having sex with
Amy Welch!
Monica  Come on, that was back in high school! How could that still bother you?
Rachel  I mean why, of all people would you want to go out with Chip?!
Monica  Look, you and I went to different high schools...
Rachel  Okay, that doesnt help me, because we went to the same high
school.
Monica  You went to one where you were popular, and you got to ride off
Chips motorcycle, and wear his letterman jacket. I went to one where I wore a band
uniform they had to have specially made.
Rachel  (shocked) They had to have that specially made?!
Monica  It was a project for one of the Home Ec classes.
Rachel  (stunned) Oh my God, they told us that was for the mascot!
Monica  Back then, I thought that I would never, ever get the chance to go out
with a Chip Matthews, and now hes-hes called me up and asked me out. And the
fat girl inside of me really wants to go. I-I owe her this. I never let her eat.
Rachel  Oh, you go out with him. (goes over and hugs her)
Monica  Oh, really?!
Rachel  Yeah. Just, if its possible, could you leave him somewhere and go
have sex with another guy?
Monica  Ill try.
[Scene  Monica and Rachel's, the next morning, they are all there eating breakfast.]
Ross  So you guys having any luck getting rid of the entertainment center?
Joey  Well, there were a couple of calls last night, but ah, I dont think
any of them are gonna work out.
Chandler  Yes, Joey has a very careful screening process. Apparently, not
everyone is qualified to own wood and nails.
Phoebe  (is struggling with the cat) Stop it! Stop it! She keeps squirming,
trying to get away! Just like when she was alive.
Ross  So Pheebs, how long is your mom gonna be with us?
Phoebe  Well, Im not sure. I mean, I guess until she y'know, gets used to
the fact that theres y'know, a new mom. Y'know, I think shes worried that
y'know, shes gonna, shes gonna be replaced. (to the cat, in a funny voice)
Well, thats not gonna happen is it? Noo. (gets up) Okay, I have to return a call in
the other room.
Monica  Why cant you use the phone in here?
Phoebe  Well, Im returning a call from a certain mom at the B-E-A-C-H. I
just spelled the wrong word. (goes into Monicas room)
Ross  So, guys, am I crazy, or does Phoebes mom remind anyone of a cat?
Monica  Ross, dont start.
Ross  Come on, you-you cant tell me you actually believe that-that
theres a woman inside that cat!
Rachel  I believe it.
Ross  No you dont.
Rachel  Yes, I do.
Ross  No you doy'know what, youre not gonna suck me into this.
Rachel  Oh sure I am, because you always have to be right.
Ross  I do not always have to beokay, okay. (starts to leave)
Rachel  Jurassic Park could happen.
[Scene  Chandler and Joey's, Joey and Chandler are showing a couple of guys (Tony and
Peter) the entertainment center.]
Tony  Wow! Thats ah, thats pretty nice!
Joey  Pretty nice?
Chandler  Youll have to pardon my roommate, he wanted to marry this.
Tony  We dont have 50 bucks, but would you be willing to trade for it?
Weve got a canoe.
Chandler  Y'know, I, I really dont think we need a canoe.
Tony  You gotta take the canoe!
Chandler  All right, just, just take the entertainment center, and then when you
get home, throw the canoe away!
Peter  Were not throwing it away! I built that canoe! (starts to leave as
Tony chases after him)
Joey  (to Peter) Good for you!!
[Scene  Central Perk, Chandler, Joey, Monica, and Ross are there.]
Rachel  (entering) You guys, youre never gonna believe what I just found
tacked up on a telephone pole! (Shes holding a flyer.) Look kinda familiar?
Ross  (taking the flyer) Apparently Phoebes mother also goes by the name
Julio.
Rachel  You guys, theres a little girl in Soho looking for this cat. I
mean, you know what that means?!
Joey  (looking at the flyer) Yeah-eah! 200 dollar reward, split five ways!!
Rachel  Do we have to tell her?
Ross  Yes, we have to tell her!
Monica  Oh, but its made her so happy.
Ross  (holds up a hand) Little girl misses her cat. (hold up the other hand)
Crazy lady thinks her mother is in a cat. (gets up) Okay, y'know what, I have to go have
dinner with my son, can I trust that when you see Phoebe, you will tell her.
All  (disappointed) Yeah.
Ross  Thank you.
Rachel  I hate when Ross is right!
Monica  He is right, isnt he?
Chandler  Y'know what, I think this might be one of the times hes wrong.
All  You think?
Chandler  Oh-no, hes right.
[Scene  Central Perk, the same scene is continued from before the break.
With Joey, Monica, Rachel, and Chandler sitting on the couch.]
Phoebe  (entering, with Julio) Hi. (sits down in the chair)
Monica  Hi!
All  Hey!
Joey  Uh, Pheebs, about your mom...
Phoebe  Yeah?
Joey  (pause) Hows that going?
Phoebe  So great. Oh, we took a nap today and my Mom fell asleep on my tummy and
purred.
Joey  Thats so sweet. (pause) Im gonna get some coffee. (gets up and
leaves)
Monica  (sliding into Joeys place on the couch to try and talk to Phoebe)
Huh? Whatd ya say Joe? Ill be right there. (gets up and joins Joey)
Rachel  Pheebs...
Phoebe  I just feel so, uhh.....
Rachel  All right!!
Chandler  Im coming already!!
Rachel  Jeez!
[Scene  Monica and Rachel's, Rachel is reading at the kitchen table as there is a knock
on the door.]
Monica  (running from the bathroom to her room, wearing only a towel) Not yet!
Not yet! Not yet! Not yet! Not yet! Not yet! Not yet! Not yet! (gets to her room and
closes the door, as Rachel gets up to answer the door.)
Rachel  Hello, Chip.
Chip  Hey, Rach! How ya doin?
Rachel  Im great! Im great. Ive got a great job at Bloomingdales,
have wonderful friends, and eventhough Im not seeing anyone right now, Ive
never felt better about myself.
Chip  So ah, Monica ready yet?
Rachel  Shell be out in a second. So, Chip, hows umm, Amy Welch?
Chip  Amy Welch? Wow! I havent seen her since... So, Monica about ready?
[Scene  Chandler and Joey's, Joey is showing off the entertainment center.]
Joey  This is the unit for you my friend. Sturdy construction, tons of storage
compartments, some big enough to fit a grown man.
Guy  What?!
Joey  Oh yeah! I got in there myself once. My roommate bet me five bucks that I
couldnt, and then he stuck a board through the handles that locked me in. Yeah. It
was funny til I started feeling like I was in a coffin.
Guy  No, you, you cant fit in that thing. Thats not deep enough.
Joey  Oh yeah? (opens up the center and takes out the stereo) If I cant,
Ill knock five bucks off the price off the unit.
Guy  All right, you have yourself a deal. (shakes his hand)
Joey  Okay. (he gets in the unit and closes the door) See?! I told ya!
Joey  Sometimes I get in here just to get away from it! Hey, a nickel!!
[Scene  A street, Chip is walking Monica to his motorcycle.]
Chip  Here, we are.
Monica  Oh my God! You still have the Chipper!
Chip  The what?
Monica  Thats what we used to call your ah, your motorcycle in high
school. Y'know how a motorcycle is a Chopper, and youre Chip. Nevermind.
Chip  No, I think its cute. (kisses her)
Monica  Wow! A lipper from Chipper.
Chip  So you still in touch with anyone from high school?
Monica  Umm. Well, theres Rachel, and umm, I think thats it. How
bout you?
Chip  Oh yeah, I still hang with Simmons and Zana, y'know. I see Spindler a lot.
Devane, Kelly, and I run into Goldie from time to time. Steve Brown, Zuchoff, McGwire,
J.T., Breadsly.
Monica  Is that all?
Chip  Ehh, y'know after high school, you just kinda lose touch. Oh yeah! I ran
into Richard Dorfman.
Monica  Ohh, how is he?
Chip  Not so good, Simmons and I gave him a wedgie.
Monica  Isnt he an architect now?
Chip  Yeah, they still wear underwear.
[Scene  Chandler and Joey's, Chandler is coming home. As we walks through the door, and
without looking up, he goes to throw his keys on the foosball table, only, its gone
and the keys it the floor. He then looks up at an empty apartment; everything is gone
except for the entertainment center and that ceramic dog. Even the food in the fridge!]
Chandler  OH MY GOD!!!
Joey  (still trapped in the entertainment center) WHAT?!!
Chandler  Are you all right?!
Joey  Yeah...
Chandler  (lets him out) What happened?!!
Joey  (getting out) Awww, man! He promised he wouldnt take the chairs!!
Chandler  What the hell happened?!! How were you locked in?!! And where the hell
is all of our stuff?!!
Joey  Well, this guy came by to look at the unit and-and he said he didnt
think big enough to fit a grown man!
Chandler  SoYou got in voluntarily?!
Joey  I was tryin to make a sale!! Oh, man, if I ever run into that guy
again, do you know what Im gonna do?
Chandler  BEND OVER?!!!
[Scene  Dots Spot, Chip and Monica are on there date, eating dinner. Chip is
telling a story.]
Chip  ...and then Zana, just let one rip!! (laughs histerically)
Monica  Look, not that I enjoy talking about people who I went to high school
with, cause I do, but umm, maybe we could talk about something else? Like you, I
dont even know where you work?
Chip  You know where I work!
Monica  I do?
Chip  The movie theatre, you used to come in all the time.
Monica  You still work at the multiplex?
Chip  Oh, like Id give up that job! Free popcorn and candy, anytime I
want. I can get you free posters for your room.
Monica  Thanks, Im set. Do you still live with your parents?
Chip  Oh yeah, but I can stay out as late as I want.
[Scene  Chandler and Joey's, Rachel, Phoebe, and Julio are consoling Joey and
Chandler.]
Rachel  Wow! They really got you guys. Your T.V. The chairs.
Phoebe  Oh yeah, your microwave. The stereo.
Joey  (looking through a deck of cards) Aww, man, he took the five of spades!!
Oh, no-no-no, here it is!
Monica  (entering) Oh my God! What happened?
Chandler  Oh, umm, Joey was born, and then 28 years later, I was robbed!!
Rachel  (to Monica) So, how was your date?
Monica  Well, y'know how I always wanted to go out with Chip Matthews in high
school?
Rachel  Um-hmm.
Monica  Well, tonight, I actually went out with Chip Matthews in high school.
Rachel  Oh honey, Im sorry.
Monica  No, its okay, not only did I get to go out with Chip Matthews, I
got to dump Chip Matthews.
Rachel  Ohh! Thats so great!
Monica  I know!
Ross  (entering) Hey! So ah, what did the insurance company say?
Chandler  Oh, they said uh, You dont have insurance here, so stop
calling us.
Ross  (seeing Phoebe still with cat) You didnt tell her?! (They all kinda
shy away.) Okay, fine! Pheebs?
Phoebe  Yeah? (sees Ross) Hi!
Ross  Hi! Listen uhh, this cat belongs to a little girl. There are flyers all
over the place.
Rachel  Im sorry, sweetie. (shows her the flyer)
Monica  Hey, we can take her back with you if you want.
Phoebe  Ohh. Um-hmm. But y'know, she choose to find me. I mean, I have to
respect her decision. Right?
Chandler, Monica, Joey, and Rachel  Thats a good call. Right.
Ross  No! No! LookHey, enough is enough! Look, I am sorry that you feel
guilty or whatever about spending time with your new mom, but this is not your old mom.
This is a cat! Okay, Julio the cat! Not mom! Cat!
Phoebe  (she turns around and puts the cat on the entertainment center) Ross,
how many parents have you lost?
Ross  None.
Phoebe  Okay, then you dont know what it feels like when one of them comes
back. Do you? I believe this is my Mother. Even if Im wrong, who cares? Just be a
friend. Okay? Be supportive.
Ross  Im sorry.
Phoebe  Okay.
Ross  I dont know what to say.
Rachel  You could.... say youre sorry to her mom.
Phoebe  I think she would like that.
Ross  (goes over to Julio) Come here, here, come here, come here, (pause) Mrs.
Buffay. Sorry, about what I said, umm, it was, it was insensitive of me to say that you
were just a cat. When clearly you are also the reincarnated spirit, of my friends
mother.
Phoebe  Thank you. We both forgive you.
Rachel  So honey, what are you gonna do about the little girl?
Phoebe  Yeah, okay, listen, umm, Mom, I hope you know you still mean a lot to
me. And youre welcome to come back anytime.
Chandler  Pheebs, if she could come back as a couch, wed really appreciate
it. (Joey nods in agreement)
Phoebe  Come on, Mom, Ill take you home.
Rachel  Ill go with you.
Monica  Me too. (they all leave)
Ross  Oh! Y'know, Ive got an extra futon.
Joey  Dude, you dont have to brag! We got nothing here!!
[Scene  Chandler and Joey's, Joey and Chandler have trading the entertainment center
for the canoe. Joey is sitting in the bow, staring off into space as to envision his
future full of possibilities. Chandler is sitting at the stern, staring into space and is
looking at an uncertain future.]

[Scene  Chandler and Joey's, Chandler is sitting in the canoe as Joey runs through the
door carrying an outdoor patio table.]
Joey  Hey!! We are so in luck! Treeger said that we
could have all this cool stuff from the basement. Wait right there. (Goes back into the
hall)
Chandler  Oh no-no-no, Im, Im paddling away!
Joey  (Returning carrying a couple of rusted lawn chairs) Huh?!
Chandler  Wow! Really?! We get all this rusty crap for free?!
Joey  Uh-huh. This and a bunch of bubble wrap. And,
some of it is not even popped!
Chandler  Could we be more white trash?
[Scene  Monica and Rachel's, Monica, Ross, Phoebe, and Rachel are eating breakfast.]
Monica  (Entering from her bedroom) How desperate am I?
Rachel  Oh! Good thing Chandlers not here, he always wins at
this game.
Monica  I just told my Mom Id cater a party for her.
Phoebe  How come?
Monica  Because I need the money, and I thought that itd be a
great way to get rid of that last little schmidgen of self-respect.
Ross  Come on, I think this is a good thing. I dont think Mom
wouldve hired you if she didnt think you were good at what you do.
Monica  You dont have to stick up for her. She cant here
you.
[Scene  Chandler and Joey's, Joey is reading the paper and Chandler is getting ready
for work.]
Rachel  (entering) Hey! Umm, do you guys have any juice?
Joey  Just pickle.
Chandler  Hey uh, Rach, funny story. I ah, bumped into Joanna on the
street yesterday.
Rachel  My boss, Joanna? Wow, that mustve been awkward.
Chandler  Well, no, actually she uh, asked me if I wanted to get a
drink.
Rachel  (laughs) You ah, you didnt say Yes to that
did you?
Chandler  (laughs) No. No!
Joanna  (Coming out of the shower wearing nothing but a towel) Hello,
Rachel. (She goes into Chandlers bedroom)
Chandler  Well, not at first.
Rachel  What is she doing here?
Rachel  I dont understand! Last time you went out with her you
said she was a big, dull dud.
Chandler  Well, I think I judged her too quickly, and this time we
were able to take the relationship to the next level.
Rachel  Well, last time I almost got fired. You must end it, you must
end it now!
Chandler  Oh, come on! Its not like this is an everyday
occurrence for me! I mean usually Im pretty much just in there by myself.
Rachel  Chandler!! (He turns around quickly) Promise me, you will end
it.
Chandler  Okay, I promise, Ill end it.
Rachel  Thank you.
Chandler  I hope you know what Im giving up for ya, because
shes not just the boss in your office, if you know what I mean.
Joey  Yeah-eh-eah! (Rachel glares at him) Oh-oh, sorry, I-I knew what
he meant.
[Scene  The Geller household kitchen, Monica and Phoebe are cooking for Mrs.
Gellers party.]
Mrs. Geller  (entering) Hows the hired help?
Monica  Doing great, the quiches are coming along.
Mrs. Geller  Whats this? Blue nail polish?
Monica  Yeah, I thought it was cute.
Mrs. Geller  Ahh, thats what your Grandmothers hands
looked like when we found her.
Monica  Let me ask you a question.
Mrs. Geller  Hmm.
Monica  Why did you hire me?
Mrs. Geller  Oh, well Richard raved about the food at his party, of
course you were sleeping with him. Then I heard the food at that lesbian wedding was very
nice, I assume you werent sleeping with anybody there. Though, at least that would
be something. (Leaves)
Monica  (to Phoebe) Oh my God! Did you hear that? She hired me because
she thinks Im good.
Phoebe  Okay, I didnt hear that.
Monica  Oh yeah, she didnt hire me out of pity, it wasnt
so she could pick on me in front of her friends, she actually thinks Im good.
Phoebe  Wow! And hey, its cool if youre a lesbian! (Gives
her a thumbs up)
[Scene  Chandler and Joey's, Joey is scrapping gum off the table as there is a knock on
the door. He goes over and opens it.]
The Salesman  (Entering before Joey can say anything) Good afternoon,
are you the decision maker of the house?
Joey  Uhhhh. (Hes not sure)
The Salesman  Do you ah, currently own a set of encyclopedias?
Joey  No! No. But ah, try the classifieds, people sell everything in
there.
The Salesman  Actually, Im not buying. Im selling. Let me
ask you one question. Do your friends ever have a conversation and you just nod along even
though youre not really sure what theyre talking about?
Ross  Im telling you its totally unconstituional.
Monica, Chandler, Phoebe, and Rachel  Oh yeah, I totally agree.
Monica  I think he deserves a Nobel Prize. (Joey starts to nod
Yes.)
All  Nooo!! (Joey quickly stops nodding his head.)
Chandler  it was like the Algonquin kids table. (They all laugh,
but Joey only laughs not to be left out.)
The Salesman  (Interrupting the flashback) Excuse me, Im sorry,
you havent said anything for about two and a half minutes, are you at all
interested?
Joey  Yeah-well-yeah! Yeah-oh-yeah. Come on in.
[Scene  The Gellers Kitchen, Monica and Phoebe are still cooking.]
Phoebe  Thats weird.
Monica  What?
Phoebe  Your nails.
Monica  Oh, I know, I never wear fake ones. I just did it so my Mom
wouldnt give me grief about me biting them.
Phoebe  Oh, no, I meant that its weird that you only have nine
now.
Monica  (Looks at her nails) Oh my God. Wait a minute, I had them
put (realises) Oh my God! Its in the quiche! Oh My God!
Phoebe  Okay, dont panic. Im gonna go to the store,
Im gonna get you another set of nails, no ones gonna know, and youre
gonna look great. (She runs over to get her coat.) Oh! Oh, its cause
theyre gonna eatthats the problem.
Mrs. Geller  (entering) (to Monica) Honey, dont bite your nails.
Monica  Okay ah, please dont freak out. Umm, but ah,
theres a blue fingernail in one of the quiche cups, and theres no way to know
which one.
Phoebe  And! Whoever finds it wins the prize!
Mrs. Geller  (laughs) Im not freaking out.
Monica  Then why are you laughing?
Mrs. Geller  Its nothing, its just that now your Father
owes me five dollars.
Monica  What? You bet Id lose a nail?
Mrs. Geller  Oh no, dont be silly. I just bet Id need
these. (Opens the freezer to reveal)
Monica  Frozen lasagnas?
Mrs. Geller  Um-hmm.
Monica  You bet that Id screw up?! So all that stuff about
hiring me because I was good was
Mrs. Geller  No-no-no, that was all true. This was just in case you
pulled a Monica.
Monica  You promised Dr. Weinburg, youd never use that phrase.
Mrs. Geller  Oh honey, come on, have a sense of humour, youve
never been able to laugh at yourself.
Monica  (laughs) Thats right. My Mom doesnt have any faith
in me! Oh, thats hilarious! Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha.
Phoebe  I dont get it.
Mrs. Geller  No, I have faith
Monica  (interrupting) No! You have lasagnas! (Storms out and an
awkward silence follows.)
Oven  Ding!
Phoebe  Op, the ruined quiches are ready.
[Scene  Joannas office, Joanna and Chandler are making out on her chair. Chandler
isnt wearing any pants.]
Chandler  It just doesntfeel like were breaking up.
Joanna  No, we are. Im sad.
Chandler  Okay.
Joanna  (answering the phone) Yes. (listens) Uh, cant you wait
until tomorrow? (listens) All right. (hangs up) Unbelievable!!
Chandler  Thanks.
Joanna  No, no, that was my boss. I have to go.
Chandler  Okay. (Starts to button up his shirt)
Joanna  What are you doing?
Chandler  Im getting dressed.
Joanna  Why?
Chandler  When I walk outside naked people throw garbage at me.
Joanna  Wait. I wanna show you something.
Chandler  What is it?
Joanna  Just a little gag gift somebody gave me. (Shes holding a
pair of handcuffs) Put your hands together.
Chandler  Ah-ha, youre not the boss of me. (She kisses him)
Yeah, you are! (She handcuffs him to the chair) Ooh, saucy.
Joanna  (kisses him) Ill be back in ten minutes. (Starts to
leave)
Chandler  You are, youre gonna leave me like this?
Joanna  Knowing youre here, waiting for me I think its
kinda exciting.
Chandler  Okay. But if you dont come back soon, (She leaves and
closes the door) theres pretty much nothing I can do about it!
Joanna  (locking her door) Oh.
Sophie  Hi! I brought you back a macaroon!
Joanna  Oh great! Ill keep it in my butt with your nose. (She
grabs the cookie and walks out.)
Rachel  Thats weird, she locked the door.
Sophie  Yknow why? Shes got the Christmas bonus list in
there. I saw her working on it this morning.
Rachel  Okay, swear you wont tell, but when Mark left he gave me
a key to Joannas office. Do you wanna see the list?
Sophie  Yeah!
Chandler  Hi! (to Sophie) How are you?
[Scene  Joannas office, Chandler, still handcuffed to the chair, is looking
through the lingerie catalogue by turning the pages with his teeth. The phone rings and
Chandler answers it with his nose.]
Chandler  Hello, Joanna(Realises he doesnt know her last
name)s office.
Joanna  (on speaker phone) Im really sorry but I may be a little
while longer.
Chandler  How little?!
Joanna  A couple of hours, I feel awful.
Chandler  Look, this isnt funny! You get back here right now!
Joanna  I cant!!
Chandler  Why not?!
Joanna  Im in my bosss car!
Chandler  What?!
Joanna  Uh-oh, tunnel. (The phone gets cut off)
Rachel  (answering it) (angrily) What?!
Chandler  (in a serious, businesslike tone) Rachel, could I see you
for a moment?
Chandler  Okay, heres the situation. The keys to the cuffs are
on the back of the door. Could you be a doll and grab them and scoot on over and unlock
me? And on a totally different subject, that is a lovely pantsuit.
Rachel  You promised you would break up with her!
Chandler  I did break up with her! She just took it really, really
well!
Rachel  And the fact that you were jeopardising my career never
entered your mind?!
Chandler  It did enter my mind! But then something happened that made
it, shoot right out.
Rachel  Y'know what Chandler, you got yourself into those cuffs, you
get yourself out of them.
Chandler  No-no-no-no-no-no-no!! I cant get myself right out of
them! You must have me confused with the Amazing Chandler!! Come on, you have to unlock
me, she could be gone for hours, and Im cold, and (Stops and looks up the skirt on a
statue behind Joannas desk.)
Rachel  Oh, Chandler!! All right, this is it! (Grabs the key) You
never see Joanna again!
Chandler  Never!
Rachel  You never come into this office again!
Chandler  Fine!
Rachel  You give me back my Walkman!
Chandler  Inever borrowed your Walkman.
Rachel  Well, then I lost it. You buy me one!
Chandler  You got it! Here we go! Come on! This is great! (Rachel goes
over and unlocks the handcuffs) Ahhh! (He starts rubbing his wrist)
Rachel  Does it hurt?
Chandler  No, I just always see guys doing this when they get
handcuffs taken off them. (He runs over to where his pants are hanging) Hello sweet pants!
Rachel  Wait a minute! What are you gonna tell Joanna?
Chandler  About what?
Rachel  When she sees that youre gone, shes gonna know
that I let you out, and that I was in here, and Im gonna get fired!
Chandler  Ill make something up! Im good at lying, I
actually did borrow your Walkman!
Rachel  No, theres nothing to make up, shes gonna know
that I have a key to her office, Ive got to get you locked up back the way you were!
(She tries to drag him over to the chair, but Chandler stops her.)
Chandler  Oh-ho-ho, I dont think so!
Chandler  Well, this is much better.
[Scene  Chandler and Joey's, The salesman is trying to sell Joey the encyclopedias.]
The Salesman  So, heres somebody interesting, Joey. What do you
know about Van Gogh?
Joey  He cut off his ear.
The Salesman  And?
Joey  Im out.
The Salesman  He painted that. (Points to one of his paintings in the
book)
Joey  Wow! Thats pretty nice. I thought he cut off his ear
cause he sucked. What else you got in there?
The Salesman  Lets see, ahhh Where does the Pope live?
Joey  In the woods. No wait-wait, thats the joke answer.
The Salesman  Actually its, Vatican City. Now ahh, what do you know
about vulcanised rubber?
Joey  Spocks birth control.
The Salesman  (laughs) You need these books.
[Scene  Monicas childhood bedroom (which has been turned into a gym), Monica is
lying on the treadmill as Phoebe enters.]
Phoebe  Hey!
Monica  Hi.
Phoebe  This used to be your room? (She nods Yes) Wow! You
mustve been in really good shape as a kid.
Monica  Ohh, Im such an idiot. I cant believe I actually
thought she could change.
Phoebe  Well, who cares what your Mom thinks? So you pulled a Monica.
Monica  Oh good, Im glad thats catching on.
Phoebe  No but, why does that have to be a bad thing. Just change what
it means. Y'know? Go down there and prove your Mother wrong. Finish the job you were hired
to do, and well call that pulling a Monica.
Monica  What?
Phoebe  Okay, umm, if a kid gets straight As, his parents would
say, "Yeah, he pulled a Monica." Y'know? Or a fireman saves a baby, and they go,
"Yeah I know, he pulled a Monica." Or someone hits a homerun and the announcer
says, "Yeah, that ones outta here." Though some things dont change.
Monica  (getting up) All right, Ill go down there. But, Im
not gonna serve the lasagna. Im gonna serve something I make.
Phoebe  Wow! My breasts are really strong. (She goes and joins
Monica.)
[Scene  Joannas office, Rachel and Chandler are having a little tug-of-war with
his pants.]
Rachel  Chandler! Chandler, please, I have to get you locked up back
the way you were, I am sooo gonna lose my job, shes very private about her office.
Now I know why.
Chandler  Hey, look, youre in trouble either way! Okay? If she
comes back and sees me locked to this instead of the chair, shes gonna know you were
in here. So you might as well just let me go.
Rachel  What if I clean your bathroom for a month?
Chandler  It still wouldnt be clean. (Rachel makes an Eww,
disgusting! face) All I want is my freedom.
Rachel  Foot rubs for a month!
Chandler  Freedom!
Rachel  Ill take all of your photos and put them into photo
albums!
Chandler  Freedom! I want my freedom! Why wont you here me?!
(Opens the door) Sophie, help me! Help me!! (Sophie stands up)
Rachel  Sophie sit!!
Rachel  No! God, would you just calm down!
Chandler  Im gonna say this for the last time. Would you please
just (He moves his arm which opens the drawer and hits in the back of the head,
which proves his point.)
[Scene  Chandler and Joey's, Joey is now reading the V book, with the
salesman watching.]
Joey  Wow! Theres a lot I didnt know about vomit. (The
duck comes to the door of the bathroom, quacking.) (To the duck) In a minute. (The duck
goes back into the bathroom.)
The Salesman  So, what do you say, Joey? You get the whole set of
encyclopedias for twelve hundred dollars, which works out to just 50 bucks a book!
Joey  Twelve hundred dollars? You think I have $1200? Im home in
the middle of the day, and I got patio furniture in my living room. I guess theres a
few things you dont get from book learnin.
The Salesman  Well ah, what can you swing?
Joey  How about zero down and zero a month for a long, long time?
The Salesman  You dont have, anything?
Joey  You wanna see what I got? (He gets up to empty out his pockets)
Okay? Ive got a baby Tootsie Roll, a movie stub, keys, a Kleenex, a rock, and an
army man. Hey!
The Salesman  Okay, I-I get the picture. Uh, thanks, for your time.
(Starts to leave)
Joey  And a 50. (The salesman stops suddenly) Huh, these must be
Chandlers pants.
The Salesman  For 50 bucks, you can get one book! What will it be? A?
B? C?
Joey  Oh, I-I think Im gonna stick with the V, I wanna see how
this bad boy turns out.
[Scene  Joannas office, Rachel and Chandler are still negotiating.]
Rachel  I ah, will buy and wrap all of your Christmas gifts.
Chandler  No!
Rachel  I ah Oh! Ill squeeze you fresh orange juice every
morning!
Chandler  With extra pulp?
Rachel  (happily) Yeah!!
Chandler  No!
Rachel  Doh!! (pause) Ive got it!
Chandler  You dont have it.
Rachel  I have so got it. Theres gonna be
rumours about this, theres no way to stop it. Sophie knows, Monica and Phoebe know.
Chandler  How do Monica and Phoebe know?
Rachel  Oh, I called them. And when they ask me what I saw, I can be
very generous (Holds her hands far apart) or very (In a high pitched voice) stingy.
Chandler  (intrigued) Go on.
Rachel  I can make you a legend. I can make you this generations
Milton Berle.
Chandler  And Milton Berle has a
Rachel  Ohh, not compared to you. (Chandler nods in agreement)
[Scene  The Gellers kitchen, Phoebe is bringing in some dirty dishes.]
Monica  Well?
Phoebe  Theyre not even touching the lasagna!
Monica  Really?!
Phoebe  Oh, they love your casserole.
Monica  Yes!!
Phoebe  Its hard to believe that just a little while ago this
was nothing but ingredients.
Mrs. Geller  (entering) Well, everyone seems to be enjoying your dish.
Monica  And you?
Mrs. Geller  I thought it was quite tasty.
Monica  So if everyone liked it, and you liked it, that would make
this a success. Which would make you
Mrs. Geller  (interrupting) A bitch?
Monica  Well, I was going for wrong, but we can use your word.
Mrs. Geller  Yes, well I was wrong, and I have to say you really
impressed me today.
Monica  Wow!
Phoebe  Umm, you might even say that she pulled a Monica. (They both
look at her) (to Monica) She doesnt know we switched it. (Monica nods her head
No.)
Mrs. Geller  And the next time you cater for me, there will be nothing
but ice in the freezer. (She starts to bite her nails)
Monica  That really means a lot. Oh, and Mom, dont bite your
nails.
[Scene  Central Perk, all except Chandler, are there.]
Chandler  (hello) Hello.
Joey, Rachel, and Ross  Hey!
Monica  (in a sexy voice) Hello, Chandler. (Phoebe has a huge smile on
her face.)
Chandler  (to Rachel) I love you. (Kisses her on the forehead)
Joey  Wh-whats going on?
Phoebe  Oh.
Joey  No he doesnt!
Chandler  (checks his watch) Two hours, that lasted!
Rachel  So did you break up with Joanna?
Chandler  I think so.
Joey  Well, its good thing you got out when you did, before she
blew up like that Vesuvius.
Ross  The volcano?
Joey  Yeah. And speaking of volcanoes, man are they a violent igneous
rock formation.
Rachel  What?!
Joey  Oh yeah, lava spewing, hot ash, of course some are dormant.
Monica  Why are you talking about volcanoes all of the sudden?
Joey  Well, we can talk about something else. What do you want to talk
about? Vivisection? The Vasdeferens? The Vietnam War?
Monica  Oh! Did anybody see that-that documentary on the Korean War?
(Joey is pissed)
All  Oh, yeah. Yeah.
Phoebe  Oh God, Korea is such a beautiful country.
Ross  With such a sad history.
Chandler  Could there be more Kims?
[Scene  Rachels office, Rachel is coming in for the day.]
Joanna  (from her office) Whos out there?
Rachel  Its me! Good morning!
Joanna  Rachel, could you come in here for a moment, please?
Rachel  Yeah, sure. Umm, they didnt have poppy seed bagels, so
I (Enters Joannas office and sees her handcuffed to her chair wearing nothing
but a slip) Oh my word!
Joanna  I seem to have had a slight office mishap. Could you please
get the key off the back of the door for me.
Rachel  Oh, yeah! Yeah!
Joanna  You tell your friend Chandler that were definately
broken up this time.
Rachel  Okay.
[Scene  Monica and Rachel's, the gang is there eating breakfast. Chandler is cleaning
out his wallet.]
Phoebe  Hey! New wallet, huh?
Chandler  Yeah, it was time. The old condom ring in the leather just
doesnt say cool anymore.
Monica  Rachel!
Rachel  What?
Monica  You just put an empty carton back in the fridge!
Rachel  Oh yeah, I know, but the garbage was full.
Monica  Have you ever taken out the trash? (Hands her the garbage.)
Rachel  Well, I thought you liked doing it. (Rachel starts out the door
and stops.)
Monica  Third door on the left.
Rachel  Right!
Rachel  Oh! Hey, Mr. Treeger.
Rachel  Ummm. Oh! Im sorry. (She grabs the box and offers him a piece.)
Its a little old but
Rachel  Im sorry. I didntI dont come in here a lot.
Rachel  No.
Rachel  I didnt I never said that.
Rachel  (starting to cry) Okay, Im sorry. (Runs out still carrying the
pizza box.)
Monica  God! If youre gonna cry about it! (She grabs the box and goes to
through it out.]
[Scene  Monica and Rachel's, Continued from earlier, Rachel is now telling everyone of
her experience in the garbage room.]
Joey  Whoa-whoa, Treeger made you cry?
Rachel  Yes! And he said really mean things that were only partly true.
Joey  Im gonna go down there and teach that guy a lesson.
Monica  Joey, please dont do that. I think its best that we just
forget about it.
Rachel  Thats easy for you to say, you werent almost just killed.
Joey  All right thats it, school is in session! (Exits and slams the
door.)
Monica  (Picking up a card from Chandlers wallet.) My God! Is this a gym
card?
Chandler  Oh yeah, gym member. I try to go four times a week, but Ive
missed the last 1200 times.
Ross  So why dont you quit?
Chandler  You dont think Ive tried? You think I like having
50 dollars taken out of my bank account every month? No, they make you go all the way down
there! Then they use all of these phrases and peppiness to try and confuse you! Then they
bring out Maria.
Ross  Who is Maria?
Chandler  Oh Maria. You cant say no to her, shes like this lycra
spandex covered gymtreat.
Ross  You need me to go down there with you and hold your hand?
Chandler  No!
Ross  So youre strong enough to face her on your own?
Chandler  Oh no, youll have to come.
[Scene  Treegers apartment, Joey knocks on the door and Treeger opens it.]
Joey  Hey! You hold on pal! Now you made my friend, Rachel, cry. So now,
youre gonna go up there and apologize to her, unless you want me to call the
landlord.
Joey  Have you heard about a little something called, Not Making Girls Cry.
Joey  I have actually not heard of that.
Joey  Why dont you tell me something I dont know! (He storms out,
and once Treeger closes the door behind him, Joey makes an Oops! have.)
[Scene  Monica and Rachel's, continued from earlier, everyone is still eating
breakfast.]
Phoebe  Oh please, somebody tell me I dont have to go to work today!
Monica  Whats the matter?
Phoebe  Oh, my first massage today is this incredibly gorgeous guy, and every
time I see him I just want to do things to him that Im not allowed to charge for.
Monica  So do them for free.
Phoebe  Oh no, it is forbidden! No-no, Mrs. Potter fires people for fooling
around with clients. And its against my oath as a masseuse.
Ross  They make you take an oath?
Phoebe  No, I made myself take an oath. Yeah, no fooling around with clients and
umm, always be prepared. Yeah, that ones actually from the Boy Scouts, but it just
makes good sense.
Chandler  Why dont you just give him to somebody else?
Phoebe  No, I can handle it. No, Im a professional. (She starts to leave)
Rachel  Oh Pheebs, is that a new ankle bracelet?
Monica  Wow! And you got a petticure. Your feet are all dressed up.
Chandler  Because thats the only part of you he can see when hes on
the table!
Monica  Youre gonna do some feet flirtin!
Phoebe  I dont what your talking about. (Laughs nervously and continues to
leaqve)
Ross  Then how do you explain the toe ring?!
Phoebe  Because its Arabian princess day at work! Okay?! Leave me alone!
Rachel  Oh! My hero! What happened?
Joey  Well uh, I went down there and told him that no one treats my friends like
that and that hed better come up here and apologize. Ill see you later.
(Starts to leave)
Monica  What a minute, what did he say?
Joey  He said that he wasnt gonna apologize because you guys are living
here illegally, so instead what hes gonna do is have you evictedIll see
you later.
Rachel  What?! You got us evicted!!
Monica  I told you not to go down there!
Joey  Well he made Rachel cry!
Monica  Rachel always cries!
Rachel  Thats not true! (Starts to cry.)
Monica  Now Joey, you go down there and you suck up to him. I mean you suck like
youve never sucked before!
Joey  All right! Ill try! But if I cant, you can stay with Chandler
and I until you get settled.
Rachel  Go!!
Joey  All right, all right, all right. (Starts to leave, stops, and turns
around) I mean Ill have to check with him first, but Ill think hell be
cool with it. (Monica shoos him out.)
[Scene  Chandlers gym, He and Ross are there to cancel his membership.]
Ross  Whoa-whoa-whoa, hey! Now remember what we talked about, you gotta be
strong.
Chandler  Yes. (In a stronger voice) Yes!
Ross  One more time, "Hey, dont you want a washboard stomach and rock
hard pecs?"
Chandler  No! I want a flabby gut and saggy man breasts!
Ross  Good! Thats good!
Chandler  Okay. (They go inside) (To the guy at the desk) I wanna quit the gym.
Gym Employee  You wanna quit?
Chandler  I wanna quit the gym.
Gym Employee  You do realize that you wont have access to our new full
service Swedish spa.
Chandler  (He turns to Ross and Ross makes a Be strong sound.) I
wanna quit the gym.
Gym Employee  Okay, Dave in the membership office, handles quitters. (Both
Chandler and Ross start to make their way to the membership office.) Uh, excuse me, (to
Ross) are you a member?
Ross  Me? No.
Gym Employee  Sorry, members only.
Chandler  (horrified at the prospect of trying to quit alone and unsure about
himself) I wanna quit the gym.
Ross  Its okay man, be strong. (Chandler goes into the office.)
Gym Employee  (to Ross) So, are you a member of any gym.
Ross  No! And Im not gonna be, so you can save you little speech.
Gym Employee  Okay, no problem. (To someone out of the picture) Could you come
here for a second?
Woman  Hi, Im Maria.
[Scene  Heeling Hands Inc., Phoebes work, she is giving a massage to the guy,
Rick, she likes.]
Rick  (looking at her feet) Wow, you have really pretty feet.
Phoebe  These old things.
Rick  Would you mind spending some time on my siadic area, its been
killing me today.
Phoebe  You mean theOkay by siadic, you mean the towel covered portion.
Rick  Yeah.
Phoebe  Sure, yeah, no I can do that, yeah, because umm, y'know, the muscles in
the siadic area can get yknow, real (lifts up the towel) nice and tight. So umm,
tell me Rick, how umm, how did you injure the area.
Rick  Oh, a 16-hour sit-in for Greenpeace.

Rick  Ow! Did you just bite me?
Phoebe  No!
[Scene  Mr. Treegers apartment, Joey is there to suck up.]
Joey  Please dont kick Monica and Rachel out, this wasnt there
fault, it was mine.
Joey  No you cant do that, where would the chick and the duck live?
Joey  Noo-no-no, no, those are nicknames. Im the chick and Chandler is the
duck.
Joey  Come on man, just-just let the girls stay, Ill do whatever you want.
Joey  Yeah-yeah, absolutely.

Joey  Yeah, theres this superintendents dance, the Super Ball. I
dont know, and he wants to impress Marge, this lady super that hes a crush on.
Rachel  Well, why doesnt he practice with a girl?
Joey  Well, hes too shy, he doesnt thing hes good enough to
dance with girls yet.
Rachel  Yeah, right, he almost danced me right down thatgarbage chute.
(Starts to cry)
Monica  Oh, would you let it go already?! Youre fine!
Chandler  Hey.
Rachel  Hey! So, did you quit?
Chandler  No, I almost did, couldnt leave Ross there without a spotter!
Monica  Wait, now so you joined the gym?
Ross  And thats funny, why?
Rachel  Oh, umm, I was just yknow working out and umm Oh,
thats it.
Chandler  Were doomed. Okay, theyre gonna take 50 bucks out of our
accounts for the rest of our lives. What are we gonna do?
Monica  Well, you could actually go to the gym.
Ross  Or! Or, we could go to the bank, close our accounts and cut them off at
the source.
Chandler  Youre a genius!
Joey  Aww, man, now we wont be bank buddies!
Chandler  Now, theres two reasons.
Phoebe  (entering) Hey.
All  Hey!
Phoebe  Ohh, you guys, remember that cute client I told you about? I bit him.
Rachel  Where?!
Phoebe  On the touchy.
Ross  And thats not against your oath?!
Phoebe  No, I know! I-Im sorry, but the moment I touch him, I just wanna
throw out my old oath and take a new, dirty one.
Monica  Well, next time your massaging him, you should try and distract
yourself.
Joey  Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Like-like when Im doing something exciting and I
dont wanna get too excited, I just ahh, yknow try to thing of other
things like ah sandwiches, and ah baseball, and ah Chandler!
Chandler  Thank you, Joey.

Joey  No, its okay, but if Im Marge, my breasts are coming out my
back.
Joey  Come on man, youre not a potato.
Joey  Come on Treeger, dont say that. You just ahh, you just need more
practice. Here, come on, lets ahh, lets try it again. Come on. (they start
dancing again) Plus, it was, it was probably mostly my fault, anyway. I mean, yknow,

little dance step on the way.)

Monica  (laughing harder) You know the words! You are so into this!
Joey  All right, well maybe Im enjoying it a little bit. I mean Im
getting pretty good at it.
Rachel  Ooh, this is soo sweet, Joey our little twinkle-toes.
Joey  Hey-hey, hold on, this isnt some kind of like girly dance. All

Phoebe  Yeah! In really long hour world.
Rick  What?
Phoebe  Ugh, okay, I have an enormous crush on you. But because youre a
client, I cant ask you out, even though you give me yknow, the feeling.

Phoebe  Really?!
Rick  Yeah, really.
Phoebe  What?
Rick  Suddenly, I very aware that Im naked.
Phoebe  (laughs) Okay, quit down. (they start to kiss again)
Mrs. Potter  Mr. Simons been waiting for(sees Phoebe and Rick) Oh my
God!
Mr. Simon  Why wasnt I offered that? Id definitely pay more for
that.
Mrs. Potter  Phoebe, we have rules here, this isnt that kind of place.
Phoebe  Oh yeah, oh and I know, but this isnt what it looks like,
cause Rick is my ahh, husband.
Mrs. Potter  Oh really? Well, then youd better tell his other wife,
cause she called three times asking where he is.
Phoebe  Yes, I will tell her.

Phoebe  Its so weird, I have never been fired from anything before!
Rachel  Sweety...
Phoebe  I just-I just started walking around not knowing what to do next,
yknow? I-I started asking people on the street if they wanted massages. Then these
policemen, thought I was a whore too. Its been a really bad day, whore wise.

girl's phone number. (Rachel ignores him) Yeah-yeah, there it is, just a phone number a
really hot girl gave me. (He holds it so that Rachel can see it, she continues to ignore
him) It's no big deal, I mean it is her home phone number, but...(Rachel still ignores
him) Whoa! (Throws it in her lap) Whoa-whoops, I almost lost this baby! Yeah, the lovely
Amanda gives me her number and I-I go and drop it. (He waves it in front of Rachel's face.

Monica  Just go up to her and ask her out. (Chandler laughs) Oh, what's the
worst thing that could happen?
Chandler  I could die.
Ross  Yeah, it's-it's tough being single. That's why I'm so glad I found Amanda.
Rachel  Ross, you guys went out once. You took your kids to Chucky Cheese,
and you didn't even kiss her.
Chandler  I tell people secrets. It makes them like me.
Phoebe  (entering) Oh.
Chandler  Hey! (Phoebe sneezes)
Monica  Phoebe! You're sick, you shouldn't play. You should just go home, get in
bed, and stay there.
Phoebe  (in a nasally voice, from her cold) But I'm unemployed, my music is all
I really have now. Well music, and making my own shoes. (She puts her shoe on the table,
and it's horribly decorated) Pretty, huh? (Sneezes)
Chandler  All right, I'm gonna do it! I'm gonna get shot down. Any advice?
Monica  Just be yourself. But, not too much.
Chandler  (gets up) (softly) Wish me luck.
Ross  (loudly) Good luck!
Chandler  Wish it! (To the woman, Kathy, he likes) Hi. Hi, I-I was just sitting
over there, and uhh, Chandler. My name is Chandler. Did I say that?

waiting for a date. (Joey enters) Oh, and there he is now.
Joey  Hey!
Chandler  Hey! Hey, hey-hey, hey. (Joey kisses Kathy.)
Joey  Hey, I see you guys already met, huh?
Chandler  Yes-yes, I was just trying to figure out a way to uh, demonstrate how
I could get my exceptionally large feet into my even bigger mouth.
Joey  Didn't I tell ya? Always showin' off.
Phoebe  Before I start, I just wanna say that umm, I have a cold, so if I sneeze
in the middle of song, it's not on purpose. Oh, except the last verse of Pepper People.
(Starts to sing) Smelly cat, smelly cat. What are they feeding you? (Stops
singing) This chick sounds good. (Singing) Smelly cat, smelly--(stops singing)
Hey Gunther, be a good little boy and bring me a whiskey.
[Scene  Chandler and Joey's, Chandler is walking into the living room having just

to watch.

Chandler  Hey, listen, I'm sorry about this afternoon, y'know, if I would've
known you guys were... I never would've...
Kathy  Oh please!
Chandler  So ah, Joey tells me you two met in acting class.
Kathy  Yeah, they teamed us up as partners. Joey picked three scenes for us to
do; all of them had us making out.
Chandler  That's a good thing actually, because ah, he used to have me rehearse
with him.
Kathy  (laughs) Oh-oh-oh-oh!
Chandler  Is it on?
Kathy  No, but this wonder broom is amazing!
Chandler  Hey! (Runs over and gets his wonder broom)
Kathy  Oh my God!
Chandler  Oh! It's on! It's on!

Phoebe  It's fun, God I love how sexy I am. (Coughs really loudly.)
Joey  Oh, Kath, we should get going. We're going to by hamsters.
All  Ooh, that's great, I love those little guys.
Kathy  No, no, it's not like that. I, I work for a medical researcher.
Rachel  Well, have fun!
Kathy  Okay.
Phoebe  Well, I think it's great that the medical community is finally trying to
help sick hamsters.

Chandler  Thank you, Ross.
Ross  Yeah, he's a little sensitive right now, `cause he's so in love.
Chandler  All right.
All  Ohh!
Chandler  All right.
Monica  (turning around and doing that, "I'm making out with someone,"
thing with her hands) Ooh, umm, oh Kathy! Kathy, I love you! Oh! (She turns around and
sees Gunther staring at her and stops suddenly.)
[Scene  Monica and Rachel's, Phoebe and Monica are there.]
Phoebe  So, I need to write some depressing stuff to go along with my new floozy
voice, but nothing that sad has ever really happened to me.
Monica  Oh umm, how about your mom dying, or having to live on the streets when
you were 14?
Phoebe  Uh-huh. Oh, yeah, I could write about the time my hair did that
"Woo-hoo" thing.
Ross  (entering) Hey!
Monica  Hey!
Phoebe  Hey.
Ross  (loudly) So I'm going over to Amanda's tonight!
Monica  Rachel's not here.
Ross  Oh.
Monica  How's it going with her?
Ross  Great, actually. I'm thinking tonight, maybe the night. Yeah, I mean ah,
the kids are gonna play together and then when they're asleep, I'm thinking Amanda and I
break open a bottle of wine, and do a little "playing" ourselves.
Rachel  (entering, with a guy) Hi guys! This is Josh. Josh, these are my
friends, and that's Ross.
Monica  Hi, Josh.
Phoebe  Hi.
Josh  Dudes.
Monica  So, did you play in college? (She points to his NYU Soccer (football for
the rest of the world) sweatshirt he's wearing.)
Josh  Oh, I still do. Next year, I hope to make varsity though.
Rachel  Ross, didn't you ah, play soccer in High School? Oh no wait, that's
right. You just organized their game schedules on your Commodore 64.
Josh  Well, it's getting late, I've got to get to the game, so I'm gonna...
head.
Rachel  Okay. (He starts to leave, and Rachel grabs him and gives him a
passionate kiss.) I'll miss you.
Josh  Dope! (exits)
Phoebe  Wow, cute one!
Monica  Very!
Rachel  I know, isn't he great? It's so nice to finally be in a fun
relationship, y'know? There's nothing boring about him, and ah, I bet he's never set foot
in a museum.
Ross  Well maybe he'll get to go soon, like on a class trip or something.
Rachel  Y'know what else is really great about him, oh, what is the word for the
adult that doesn't have dinosaur toys in their bedroom?
Ross  Oh! (He bangs his fists together.)
Rachel  What was that?
Ross  Monica knows.
Monica  It's this dumb thing that Ross made up `cause he was trying to fool our
parents. It's a way of giving the finger, without actually having to give it. I remember I
cried the night you made it up, `cause it was the first time that I realized that I was
actually cooler than my older brother.
Ross  Well, I'm gonna go get ready, (Gives Monica the fist thing.) for my date
tonight, so ah, I'll just_ head.
Phoebe  Yeah, I should go to, `cause I'm playing in one hour. Hey, (clears her
voice and in her normal voice) you guys should come hear me, ooh hear me. Ooh, (tries to
sing) My sticky shoes--eww! Eww! I lost my sexy phlegm!
[Scene  Amanda's apartment, Ross is arriving with Ben.]
Amanda  (opening the door) Hi!
Ross  Hi!
Amanda  Hi Ben!
Ross  Wow! You-you look great!
Amanda  Thanks!
Ross  (she lets him in) Okay! (to her son) Hey Tommy.
Amanda  I am so glad that you could come over tonight.
Ross  Oh no-no-no, it's my pleasure.
Amanda  Okay, well, my cell phone number is right here on the counter, please
help yourself to anything in the fridge.
Ross  What?
Amanda  I appreciate this soo much, I've been trying to go out with this guy for
like a month.
Ross  I-I-I...
Amanda  (noticing the bottle of wine he has) Oh, I don't mean to be a square,
but I'd really appreciate it if you wait and drink your wine after the kids are asleep? Oh
uh, thanks for this, I hope I can do the same for you sometime. (She leaves)
Ross  Who wants to make some long distance calls?
[Scene  A street, Chandler is buying a newspaper and notices Kathy running by.]
Chandler  Kathy! Kathy! Hi!! Kathy! Kathy! (She doesn't hear him and keeps
running, Chandler starts chasing her as the theme to The Mod Squad starts to
play. First, a car almost hits him and then gets mustard splashed on him as he runs by a
hot dog vendor.) Kathy! (He keeps running and gets tangled up in the leashes of five dogs,
in desperation he throws his paper.) Fetch! Fetch it! (He frees himself and resumes the
chase) Kathy! Kathy! Kathy! (He now trips and falls into a pile of garbage, he tries to
get up and scream her name again but he has a piece of spinach in his mouth. He gets out
of the garbage and starts crossing the street by running over the hoods of a couple of
cabs.) Kathy! (He jumps in front of her and out of breath he says) Kathy.
Kathy  Hey, Chandler! What are you doing here?
Chandler  Oh, I just wanted to say, "Hey!"
Kathy  Hey!
Chandler  Okay. (He walks away disgusted with himself.)
[Scene  Monica and Rachel's, Ross is telling Monica about his new baby sitting job.]
Monica  Oh come on! You're making it sound worse than it actually was.
Ross  Her date tipped me ten dollars. (Monica laughs)
Ross  Pheebs, what are you doing?
Phoebe  Okay, I wanna be sexy again so I'm trying to catch a cold. It should be
easy, supposedly they're pretty common.
Monica  Phoebe, you'll catch pneumonia.
Chandler  (entering) Okay. You were right. I'm in love with Joey's girlfriend.
Phoebe  What?!
Ross  Are you serious?
Phoebe  Well, how-how-how is that possible? You barely know her!
Chandler  I don't know. I can't--I just, I can't get her out of my head. Y'know?
I mean, I'm a very bad person. I'm a very, very bad person. I'm a horrible person. (he
waits for a reaction, when he doesn't get one) No you're not Chandler! We still love you
Chandler!
Monica  (sneezes) Oh gosh, Phoebe, I think I caught your cold.
Phoebe  You mean you stole it! (Monica sneezes again) Don't cover your mouth
when you do that!
Joey  Hey.
Kathy  (to Chandler) We were just talking about you.
Chandler  Really?!
Joey  Yeah-yeah, I told her about the time you got drunk and fell asleep with
your head in the toilet.
Chandler  (laughs) Right in there!
[Scene  Chandler and Joey's, Chandler is playing Hide-and-Go-Seek with the chick and
the duck.]
Chandler  99...100! Ready or not, here I come! (He opens his eyes and sees that
the chick and the duck are still sitting in front of him) All right, let's go over the
concept one more time.
Joey  (entering) Hey!
Chandler  Hey!
Joey  Hey guys. (to Chandler) Listen uh, you wanna get some dinner with me and
Kathy tonight?
Chandler  Ohh, umm, y'know what, I already ate.
Chandler  Y'know I had a big meal on Monday, y'know. So that's just gonna get me
straight through the week.
Joey  Okay, I see what's going on here.
Chandler  You-you do?
Joey  Yeah! You don't like Kathy.
Chandler  You got me.
Joey  Yeah, you've been avoiding her ever since we started going out. Look, I
made an effort to like Janice, now I think it's your turn to make an
effort to like Kathy by going out to dinner with us. Right?
Chandler  Yeah. Right.
Joey  Good, and hey! My treat. (He turns to go into his bedroom then stops.) But
that's only because you're not eating anything, right?
Chandler  Okay.
[Scene  Monica and Rachel's, Rachel is returning from a date with Josh, and when they
get the door open, Rachel turns and passionately kisses Josh.]
Monica  (lying on the couch suffering from her cold) Ross isn't here.
Rachel  Oh. (She tries to walk away from Josh, by he keeps holding her) Stop it!
Josh  So I'll see you at the party? Beer's beer man, 24, 7!!
Rachel  Yeah! (Monica gives a sarcastic thumbs up) (Josh leaves) I am soo gonna
marry that guy. (looking in her wallet) Ohhh!
Monica  What?
Rachel  I think he's stealing from me.
Monica  Why?
Rachel  Because he's stealing from me!
Phoebe  (entering) Hi! It's me. And soup. (to Rachel) Hey, I just saw Josh, he
looks so yummy in your leather jacket.
Rachel  Ughh! (Storms out after him)
Phoebe  (to Monica) Here, now I don't eat chicken, so it's just noodle soup. And
there's no chicken in the broth either, so it's really just... noodle water.
Monica  Thank you so much Phoebe.
Phoebe  (picking up Monica's used Kleenex and putting some in her pocket.) Sure.
Monica  What are you doing with those?!
Phoebe  But, I need your germs! I want my cold back! I miss my sexy voice.
Monica  Sorry, Phoebe.
Phoebe  It's okay. How's the soup?
Monica  Umm. (nodding her head, "Good.")
Monica  Ohhhh!! Gross!!
[Scene  A nightclub, Chandler is having dinner with Kathy and Joey.]
Kathy  Ohh, God, guys, check it out, you can see that girl's underwear!
Joey  Is she great or what?
Kathy  (to Chandler) So? Huh? What do you think?
Chandler  Ohh, she's-she's not really my type.
Kathy  Not your type?! She's gorgeous!
Chandler  Y'know what I think it is? It's the fishnet stockings. Y'know?
Whenever I see a girl in fishnet stockings it reminds me of my father in fishnet
stockings.
Kathy  Okay. Understanding a little more why you're single. Ohh! Y'know, I have
a friend you would like, she's really pretty. And then we could double date!
Chandler  Uhh, no-no thanks.
Kathy  Okay, I've got some ugly friends, and they're all available too.
Chandler  Listen, I-I'm gonna grab a beer. (Leaves)
Joey  (to Kathy) I'll be right back. (to Chandler) What was that?
Chandler  What?
Joey  Kathy was being really nice and you just walked away. I thought we had a
deal.
Chandler  Hey, look, what do you want from me?
Joey  I want you to like her! But if that's too damned difficult for you, then
the least you can do is pretend.
Chandler  I am pretending.
Joey  Well then, do it better!
Chandler  Okay, what do you saw I go over there and say how much I like her?
(Joey gives him a thumbs up) No-no it'll be good, I can tell her much I've been thinking
about her. That I haven't stopped thinking about her since the moment I met her. That I'm
so fantastically, over-the-top, wanna-slit-my-own-throat in love with her, that for every
minute of every hour of every day I can't believe my own damn bad luck that you met her
first!!
Joey  Well, that's pretty good. But you might wanna tone it down a little.
[Scene  Monica and Rachel's, Monica and Rachel are there.]
Ross  (entering) Hey! So, uhh, Amanda just-just dropped me off. Yeah, that's one
of the things I love about her, she's...uh, she's old enough to drive. (to Monica) So uhh,
I guess you're not going to mom and dad's tonight?
Monica  No, sorry.
Rachel  Well where's Amanda?
Monica  Hey Rach, could you get me some cough drops?
Rachel  I mean y'know, I'm thinking. You could bring her, and you guys could go
up to your old room, and not make out.
Monica  Ross, cough drops, please?
Ross  At least I know she's not going out with me to get into R rated movies.
Rachel  Why don't you just marry her? Oh no, wait a minute you can't, I'm sorry
I forgot, she's not a lesbian.
Ross  You see Amanda and I have a very special...
Monica  (interrupting) You have nothing! You're not even going out! You're her
baby sitter! You have a 12-year-old girl's job!
Rachel  (laughing) Ohh, that is soo sad.
Monica  And what are you laughing at, Miss
`My-keg-sucking-boyfriend-is-stealing-from-me!'
Rachel  Hey, so he stole a couple bucks from me! At least he bought me something
with it! (Shows her, her ring)
Monica  That's mine!! Now, would you both please start acting like adults? And
get me my cough drops!
Ross  Fine.
Rachel  Sorry.
Ross  Here. (Hands her, her cough drops) (to Rachel) At least I made ten bucks
in my relationship.
Rachel  Y'know...
[Scene  Central Perk, Phoebe is there with her guitar.]
Phoebe  (singing) Platting goats are platting. Platting down the street.
Platting goats are platting, leaving little treats. (to Gunther) Does it even work
without my sexy voice?
Gunther  I like it. (sneezes)
Phoebe  Gunther, kiss me.
Gunther  What?
[Scene  Chandler and Joey's, Chandler is watching TV as Joey and Kathy are laughing in
Joey's bedroom. They get to be pretty loud so Chandler turns the TV way up.]
Joey  (opening the door wearing nothing but a sock, and holding a dart board
over the `Little General.') Hey! (Chandler turns down the TV) Now, we're not actually
gonna be sleeping in her, but do you mind?
[Scene  Monica and Rachel's, Monica, with a blanket draped over her shoulders, opens
the door to a similarly clad Chandler.]
Chandler  Can I sleep on your couch?
[Scene  Central Perk, Phoebe is singing, with everyone else present.]
Phoebe  (singing) And I'm still waiting for my paper mache man. Thank
you my babies.
Gunther  Rachel?
Rachel  Yeah.
Gunther  I don't know if you heard about what happened between me and Phoebe the
other day_
Rachel  No!
Gunther  Well, we kissed. I-I-I didn't initiate the kiss, but-but I also didn't
stop it, and I've been feeling guilty.
Rachel  (confused) Okay.
Gunther  So umm, are we cool?
Rachel  (really confused) Okay.
Gunther  I knew you'd understand.

Chandler  (entering in a bathrobe) I just walked in the bathroom and saw Kathy
naked! It was like torture!
Ross  Y'know if we ever go to war and youre captured, youre in for a
big surprise.
Chandler  It just keeps getting worse and worse! Y'know? I mean its bad
enough that Im in love with my roommates girlfriendwhich by the way, I think
she knows. Because every time were in the room together theres this weird like
energy between us. And call me crazy, but I think she likes me too. And now I have seen
her naked. I mean at least when Ive seen her with clothes on, I could imagine her
body was like covered in boles or something. But there are no boles, shes smooth!
Smooth! (leaves)
Phoebe  Wow! Could everyone totally see up his robe?
All  Yeah! Oh my God!
[Scene  Central Perk, Joey is getting a phone number from a woman (Casey) as Chandler
watches from the doorway.]
Casey  Here you go.
Joey  Great! All right, so Ill call you later.
Casey  Great! (leaves)
Chandler  (rushing up) Hey-Hey-Hey! Who was that?
Joey  That would be Casey. Were going out tonight.
Chandler  Goin out, huh? Wow! Wow! (Does a little celebration dance) So
things didnt work out with Kathy, huh? Bummer.
Joey  No, things are fine with Kathy. Im having a late dinner with her
tonight, right after my early dinner with Casey.
Chandler  (shocked) What?
Joey  Yeah-yeah. And the craziest thing is that I just ate a whole pizza by
myself! (Laughs)
Chandler  Wait! Youre going out with Kathy!
Joey  Yeah. Why are you getting so upset?
Chandler  Well, Im upsetfor you. I mean, having sex with an endless
line of beautiful women must be very unfulfilling for you. (He cant believe he just
sad that.)
Joey  What is the big deal? Its not like were exclusive.
Chandler  Look, Joey, Kathy is clearly not fulfilling your emotional needs. But
Casey, I mean granted I only saw the back of her head, but I got this sense that
shes-shes smart, and funny, and gets you.
Joey  You got all that from the back of her head?
Chandler  All right look, I think its time for you to settle down. Y'know?
Make a choice, pick a lane.
Joey  Whos Elaine?
[Scene  Monica and Rachel's, Ross and Monica are sitting on the couch playing cards,
and Phoebe is working on a new song.]
Phoebe  (singing) "Little, tiny Tarzan, swinging on a nose hair.
Swinging with the greatest of ease" Darn it! Now, I dont know who to
get to the next verse.
Ross  Oh, you could just go uh, "greatest of ease (plays air
guitar) BAH-bah-bha-bhannn." Then go right into it.
Phoebe  Yeah, ooh, I like that! Yeah. Wait! How do you know about
bah-bah-bha-bhan?
Ross  Well umm, yknow, I used to play.
Phoebe  Oh yeah, thats right, the keyboards, huh?
Ross  Yeah, just a little in high school, but then I really got into it in
college. I mean thats-thats when I really found my sound.
Monica  Oh God! Orange juice just came out of my nose, but it was totally worth
it. Oh my God, I completely forgot about your sound.
Ross  Yeah.
Monica  He used to lock himself in the basement for hours. No one was every
allowed to hear, "The Sound."
Phoebe  I wanna hear "The Sound."
Ross  Really? No. I mean, nah, I havent played in so long, and-and, well
its-its really personal stuff, yknow?
Phoebe  Come on, play that funky music white boy.
Monica  Yeah!
Ross  No, you guys, I mean my keyboards are all the way up inNo, yeah,
okay. (Runs out.)
Ross  Okay, guys.
Chandler  All right! Bring it on, you
Ross  Here we go. (Plays one note) Yknow, Ive-Ive never played
my stuff for anyone before, so its important that-that you understand its
about communicating very private emotions. (Plays another note) Yknow, umm, you
should-you should think of umm, my work as wordless sound poems. Thats what
Im
Chandler  (interrupting) Oh my God! Play!
Monica  (At a loss for words) Boy, that was-that was, umm terrific.
Chandler  Really, bitchin!
Phoebe  Wow, it was sowow!
Ross  Really?! I mean, really?!!
Rachel  Yeah, I mean, you should play in public!
Ross  Wow! Thanks, you guys. Thats uhohhh, I wanna, I wanna play you
another piece! Umm! Uh-oh! I left my uh, helicopter sounds on another disk. Ill be
right back! Okay? (Runs to fetch them) This is so nice, ImI am so
(starts to break up and leaves)
Monica  Oh God bless my dad sound proofing the basement!
Rachel  Oh, I cant believe I ever let him touch me with those fingers.
Phoebe  What are you guys talking about, I loved it! It was soo moving. Oh, plus
its just, its so different from the stuff you usually hear.
Chandler  You mean like, music?
[Scene  Chandler and Joey's, Chandler is watching Yasmein Bleeth running on TV, and the
duck starts quacking.]
Chandler  Yeah, I know what youre thinkin! Yes, yes, your breasts
are just as firm and juicy.
Chandler  Come in!
Kathy  (entering) Hey! (sees whats on TV) Oh God, is that Baywatch?
Chandler  Uh yes, but uh, I just watch it for the articles.
Kathy  So is Joey around?
Chandler  No-no, hes not back yet, but hell be here any minute. So
uh, come on in. Have a seat. Bow or stern?
Kathy  I uh, dont really have a preference. You?
Chandler  I like it in the stern. (Realizes what he just said.) of the
boat. (The phone rings, and he answers it.) (on phone) Hello.
Joey  (on the other end at a pay phone) Hey, its me. Listen Casey and I
were on our way back and had a little car trouble.
Chandler  What happened?
Joey  We broke down on the Parkway, so I have to walk back and get some
transmission fluid. And hey, listen could you please tell Kathy that Ill be there as
soon as I can.
Chandler  Why cant you tell her?
Joey  Cause I only have one quarter, and I think my time is about
to(he stops talking suddenly)
Chandler  Joey! Joey!!
Joey  Yeah?
Chandler  I thought your time ran out.
Joey  Me too, but I guess I do have a couple of more(his time runs out for
real)
Chandler  (to Kathy) Uhh, that was Joey. Hes running a little late, he
says hes sorry.
Kathy  Oh.
Chandler  So I guess its just uh, you and me then.
Kathy  Oh, okay.
Chandler  Yeah, I think it is!
Kathy  So what did you do today?
Chandler  Oh, I had an appointment to get my haircut
Kathy  (interrupting) Oh, it looks great!
Chandler  and then it got canceled.
Kathy  Well, I could cut it.
Chandler  Really?! You do that?
Kathy  Yeah, I do. Of course, I learned at my aunts dog grooming shop, but
hey, what do you say?
Chandler  Dog grooming huh? Okay, just dont make my tail too poofy.
Kathy  You have really great hair.
Chandler  Well, thanks. I grow it myself. (Kathy is running her fingers through
his hair, and Chandler catches himself enjoying it too much.) Yknow who also has
great hair is Joey!
Kathy  Yes! Yeah! Joey has great hair! Umm, Im basically done here. Just
let me get this off your neck.
Chandler  What-what cha doin?
Kathy  Checking to see if its even.
Chandler  Kay.
Kathy  Looks good.
Chandler  (jumping up to answer the phone) Oh the phone! The phones making
sounds! (On phone) Hello!
Joey  (on phone) Hey dude, its me.
Chandler  Hey its Joey!
Joey  Listen uh, Im really sorry, it looks like Im gonna be stuck
here for a while. I got the transmission fluid, but when I went to put it in the car, the
transmission wasnt there!
Chandler  What?
Joey  Yeah, it mustve fallen out a few blocks back. I just figured we hit
a dog.
Chandler  Okay.
Joey  Listen uh, could you put Kathy on, I wanna apologize.
Chandler  Oh yeah man. (to Kathy) Joey. (Hands her the phone.)
Kathy  (on phone) Hey. (listens) Oh no its fine, dont worry about
it. (listens) Yeah-no, stop apologizing, its okay. (listens) Yeah! Ill talk to
you tomorrow. (hangs up) (to Chandler) I should uh, probably go.
Chandler  Yeah. Yes! Yeah.
Kathy  I forgot my purse.
Chandler  Oh.
Kathy  No, I really did forget my purse.
[Scene  Chandler and Joey's, continued from earlier. Chandler and Kathy are still
kissing, then they stop suddenly.]
Chandler  No-no-no-no, this is bad! Its bad! This is bad!
Kathy  Horrible!
Chandler  Wait the uh, the kiss or the situation?
Kathy  No-no-no, the kiss was good.
Chandler  Okay!
Kathy  No, but thats bad!
Chandler  Ooh! Yes! Okay! Heres what we do, we-we forget it happened.
Kathy  What?!
Chandler  Okay, we-we swallow our feelings. Even if it means were unhappy
forever. Sound good?
Kathy  Can you really do that?
Chandler  I have to; hes my best friend, and youre seeing him.
Kathy  Chandler, I like Joey a lot, but with you
Chandler  (interrupting) Oh-no-no-no! Dont! Dont! See-see,
youre getting me confused, Im starting to urn.
Kathy  Im sorry. If you wanna pretend that nothing happened, I can try.
Chandler  I-I think we have too.
Kathy  Okay. Bye.
Chandler  Bye. (Kathy leaves and Chandler wonders over to and leans up against
the door.) Are you still out there?
Kathy  (outside the door) No. (Chandler opens the door and they kiss again.)
[Scene  Central Perk, Ross is performing, his music hasnt improved.]
Ross  (His voice is altered to sound like a computer.) Electrifying. (He plays
the sound of a ticking clock.) Emphatic time-time-time
Monica  (to Rachel and Phoebe) Y'know, theres a Starbucks about
three blocks down.
Phoebe  (pushing Monica back onto the couch) Its so inspired! Look at him!
Look at him go!
Ross  (with the altered voice) Thank you guys-guys-guys
Monica  (to Phoebe) Hey, arent you up next?
Phoebe  Oh no, Im not playing tonight.
Rachel  Why not?
Phoebe  I cant follow Ross! Itd be like those bicycle ridding chimps
that followed The Beetles. No.
Monica  Phoebe, Ross sucks!
Rachel  Phoebe, the place has emptied because of him.
Phoebe  Oh my God, hes not even appreciated in his own time. I would give
anything to not be appreciated in my own time!
Monica  Okay. Umm, Phoebe, you suck too.
Rachel  Yeah, Phoebe youre awful!
Phoebe  You guys. You suck too. (She hugs them both.)
[Scene  Chandler and Joey's, Joey is opening the door, but Chandler has the chain on
it.]
Joey  Aww man! I cant believe I locked myself out again! (He knocks on the
door.)
Chandler  Hang on buddy! (He goes over and unlocks the door and opens it to
reveal a fully furnished apartment.)
Joey  (rushing in) Oh my God! What happened here? Did you do all this?
Chandler  I sure did.
Joey  Why?
Chandler  Well, I just thought itd make me feel good to do something nice
for my friend.
Joey  Well, youre amazing.
Chandler  Oh no-no-no. This is amazing. (He goes over and
presses a button on a remote control that opens the entertainment center doors revealing
the TV.)
Joey  (very excited) A TV as if it appears from nowhere! Thats the dream!
Man, how did you afford this stuff?
Chandler  Well, yknow Im 29. I mean who needs a savings account.
Joey  Oh, you are the best friends anyone has ever had.
Chandler  Oh, I dont know.
Joey  Oh-no-no-no, you are! You do this, you give me the great advice, and hey
listen, I was thinking about what you said yesterday about focusing on one woman, Im
gonna do that.
Chandler  You mean with Casey.
Joey  No-no-no, I think Im gonna see how things go with Kathy. Shes
pretty cool.
Chandler  Or Casey.
Joey  No-no, Kathy.
Chandler  Could be Casey.
Joey  No. No, Kathy.
Chandler  Consider Casey.
Joey  Yknow what I think? I think somebodys got a little crush on
Casey. How bout I fix you two up? What do you think?
Chandler  That all the pieces of my life are falling right into place!
[Scene  Central Perk, Ross has just finished playing.]
Ross  (to Phoebe) Hey!
Phoebe  Hey! You were really great! You were really, really great!
Ross  Oh, thanks, thanks. So Monica tells me that uh, you dont want to
play anymore because me and y'know my talent. Is that true?
Phoebe  Well, kinda. Yeah. Yeah.
Ross  Pheebs
Phoebe  Yeah, I-I cantI mean yknow I was trying to be really
y'know okay and upbeat about it, I justI feel so dwarfed by your musical gift.
I
Ross  See but, Pheebs that-that is the exact opposite intent of my music.
Yknow my music is-is meant to inspire, and if it bothers you this much, then I
I wont play anymore.
Phoebe  Oh no. No-no-no, dont do that! How could I live with myself if I
knew I was depriving the world of your music.
Ross  Yeah, okay.
[Scene  Central Perk, Rachel and Monica are sitting on the couch and Phoebe is getting
coffee as Chandler enters. Ross is also there.]
Ross  Hey Chandler! Saw the new furniture. Very nice.
Monica  Yeah! Joey has the best boyfriend ever!
Chandler  I kissed Kathy.
Ross  What?
Monica  Are you serious?
Phoebe  Does Joey know?
Chandler  No. Is there anyway, anyway you think hell
understand this?
Monica  You obviously havent screwed over a lot of your friends. (They all
look at her) Which we all appreciate.
Ross  No the-the sad thing is, if you had told him how you felt before you
kissed her, knowing Joey, he probably just wouldve just stepped aside.
Chandler  Oh, dont say that! Dont say that. Thats not true. Is
it?
Phoebe  I think maybe, yeah.
Monica  He loves you.
Chandler  Then why didnt you tell me to do that?!!
Ross  Well, I said-I said something to Phoebe.
Phoebe  Yeah! No, thats right. And I thought it was a really good idea.
Rachel  I know, I remember that!
Monica  I remember you did.
Chandler  God!! (Sits down in disgust.) What am I gonna do?!
Rachel  Well, Chandler, youre gonna have to tell him.
Chandler  Why?! Why do I have to tell him?!
Rachel  Because you do.
Chandler  Yeah, I know.
Ross  Hey, would it be okay if I wrote a song about this.
[Scene  Chandler and Joey's, Joey is watching TV as Chandler enters.]
Chandler  Hey!
Joey  Hey! Samboucha Margarita?
Chandler  Is that a real thing?
Joey  Well, we only had samboucha, so it is now.
Chandler  Listen ah, Joe, I-I need to, I need to talk to you about something.
Joey  Whats up?
Chandler  Its-its about Kathy. Umm, uh, I like her. I like her a lot
actually.
Joey  You do?
Chandler  Yeah.
Joey  Well, youre timing couldnt be better. Shes not my
girlfriend anymore.
Chandler  What?
Joey  Yeah, she broke up with me.
Chandler  Oh uh, when?
Joey  Just now, after acting class. At first I thought she was doing some kind
of scene, thats why I let people watch.
Chandler  Oh man, I am so sorry. Are, are you okay?
Joey  Well, Ive been better. But, Im all right. So you like her huh?
Chandler  Yes, but I-I uh, dont have too.
Joey  No-no-no, no its uh, its okay.
Chandler  Yeah?
Joey  Yeah. You know why? Cause you came to me first.
Chandler  Well, I thought that would be the best thing to do.
Joey  But hey, listen just so you know, you might have youre work cut out
for you. Cause when I talked to her, I kinda got the feeling that shes into
some other guy. So
Chandler  See uh, thats-thats actually what I wanted to talk to you
about. I-I think I know who the other guy is.
Joey  Who?
Chandler  Its me. Im the other guy.
Joey  What?
Chandler  Yeah, I mean when you were late last night, Kathy and I got to
talking, and one thing to another and
Joey  And what?! Did you sleep with her?!
Chandler  No! No! No! I just kissed her.
Joey  What?!! Thats even worse!!
Chandler  How is that worse?!
Joey  I dont know! But its the same!
Chandler  Look, Im sorry! But theres nothing I can do, I think
Im in love with her!
Joey  Who cares?! You went behind my back! I would never do that to you!
Chandler  Youre right, I have no excuses! I was totally over the line.
Joey  Over the line?! You-youre-youre so far past the line, that
you-you cant even see the line! The line is a dot to you!
Chandler  Yes. Yes! Right! And I feel horrible. You have to believe me!
Joey  Is that why you bought all this stuff?! (Chandler makes a face like
"Well, kinda.") Well, yknow what I will not watch your TV, I will not
listen to your stereo, and theres a cinnamon raisin loaf in the new bread maker that
Im not gonna eat! You know why?!
Chandler  Probably because
Joey  Because its all tainted with your betrayal. From now on this
apartment is empty for me! And Im not happy about you either. (The bread maker
dings) Oh, and just so you know, I made that bread for you. (Joey walks into his bedroom
and slams the door.)
[Scene  Central Perk, Ross is playing his music. Monica, Phoebe, and Rachel are sitting
on the couch.]
Phoebe  Oh my God, hes lost it. Hes totally lost it.
Monica  (removing ear plugs) What?
Rachel  Phoebe, his music could not get any worse. There are
rats in the basement that are hanging themselves.
Ross  Thank you, thanks. (Sits down next to the girls) Yeah, I lost it.
Yknow, Im not gonna play anymore, (to Phoebe) would you, can you finish my
set?
Phoebe  After that? Yeah! No, I mean if I can help.
Ross  Yeah, like I could lose it.
Rachel  What?
Ross  I played bad on purpose guys.
Monica  Okay, so you were trying to play bad this whole time.
Ross  Yeahno, just that last song.
[Scene  Chandler and Joey's, Joey is sitting at the counter reading a magazine as the
phone rings.]
Joey  (answering phone) Hello.
Chandler  (on phone) Hey, its me. I know you cant stand to be in the
same room as me, so I just thought Id try and apologize over the phone. All I
(Joey hangs up the phone in disgust.)
Joey  (answering phone) Hello.
Chandler  Look I never should have kissed your girlfriend, but Im
(Joey hangs up the phone again.)
Joey  (answering phone) Stop callin!!
Voice  (on phone) Hey! Hey! Hey! This is 92.3, WXRK, K-Rock for our $1,000 daily
challenge.
Joey  All right!
Voice  What is the name of your roommate who is very, very sorry and would do
anything (Joey realizes its Chandler and hangs up the phone in anger.)
[Scene  Monica and Rachel's, everyone but Joey and Chandler are there getting ready for
Thanksgiving.]
Chandler  (entering) Aww, turkey! Aww, giving thanks! Aww!
Phoebe  Look everyone, its the spirit of Thanksgiving!
Rachel  So are things with you and Joey any better?
Chandler  They couldnt be worse. I spent eight hours calling him last
night, just trying to get him to talk to me.
Rachel  Oh wow, eight hours? So you could probably really use one of those
plug-in telephone headsets huh?
Ross  Should we all expect Christmas gifts that can be stolen
from your office?
Rachel  You shouldnt.
Phoebe  Speaking of Christmas, umm since Monica and I are starting a new
business and have like no money, umm, this year maybe we could do secret Santa, and then
we each only buy one gift. And-and theres the added mystery of who gets who.
Ross  Who gets whom. (They all look at him.) I dont know why I do that.
Rachel  Well, Im gonna take a nap, turkey makes me sleepy.
Monica  We havent eaten yet!
Rachel  I know, but all that work youre doing to get it ready, I
just (goes into her bedroom.)
Chandler  Hey, by any chance did either of pick uh Rachel for your secret Santa,
cause I wanna trade for her.
Phoebe  I picked her! Oh thank God you want her! Ooh!
Chandler  Wow! Why do you want to get rid of her so badly?
Phoebe  Because she exchanges every gift she ever gets, its like
impossible to get her something she likes. Come on, lets trade!
Chandler  Oh thats not true! Thats not true! I got her that backpack
and she loved it! I remember how much she was crying the day when that big dog ran off
with it (notices the look on Monica and Phoebes faces.) Oh, there was no big
dog. All right this sucks! I already got her this briefcase, and I had R.G. put on
it (Phoebe looks confused.) Her initials
Phoebe  Ohh.
Monica  Well, maybe you could give to somebody else. Ooh, like Ross Geller.
Chandler  Op, y'know what though, its kindve a girlie briefcase.
Monica  Who cares? He works in a museum!
Chandler  Hey, what time is it? The big game is about to start!
Phoebe  You dont have to do that, Ross and Joey arent here, you can
watch the parade if you want.
Chandler  Thanks.
Monica  What is wrong with this freezer?! (She jabs her arm into the freezer and
a piece of ice flies into her eye.) Ow! Ow!!
Phoebe  God, what happened?!
Monica  Oh my God, ice just got in my eye!
Rachel  (standing in her doorway) People are trying to sleep in here!
Chandler  Monica got ice in her eye, and it hurts.
Phoebe  Open it up, let me see.
Monica  Oh, yknow what, I cant, it really kills.
Chandler  Well maybe you should put some ice on it.
Phoebe  Ooh, God it looks bad.
Rachel  Honey, maybe we should take you to a doctor.
Monica  No, my eye doctor is Richard! I cant go to him when I dont
have a boyfriend!
Chandler  Hes really picky about his patients.
Phoebe  Honey, youve got to go. Whats his office number?
Monica  Like I remember his office number! (Pause) Speed dial 7.
Phoebe  (on phone) Hi! Yeah, Im calling on behalf of Monica Gellers
eye, and is um, is Richard Burke in today. (Listens) (to Monica) Hes out of town,
but does she want to see the on-call doctor?
Monica  Yes!!
Phoebe  Yes! Shes very excited about that.
Phoebe  This is so cool, til Monica gets back, its like Im
head chef and I get to make all the decisions. (She looks at the remaining butter, and
then decides to add it to the dish.)
Ross  Hey-hey, I thought she told you to follow the recipe exactly!
Phoebe  Okay, get out of my kitchen!
Chandler  (entering) All right! Okay! I think I am making some progress with
Joey, when I went into the apartment he went straight into his bedroom but he only slammed
the door once! (Ross is pleased.) I mean yeah, he gave me the finger while doing it.
Phoebe  All right I I gotta call my mom and ask her a left handed cooking
question.
Ross  So listen ah, I picked Monica for secret Santa, but Im already
getting her something for Chanukah, I was wondering if you wanna switch.
Chandler  Oh yknow what, I was already trying to trade for ah, well, you.
Ross  Really?! Wow! Thats-thats so nice, what are you gonna get me?
Chandler  I dont know R.G., I was thinking something girlie for your
office.
Ross  Yeah, well maybe Phoebe will switch with me.
Chandler  Oh no-no-no, you dont want to do that, then youre gonna
get stuck with Rachel and she exchanges every gift she ever gets.
Ross  Oh, thats not true! Ive got her lots of stuff she never took
back.
Chandler  Like?
Ross  Like uh, that gold necklace I got her last year.
Chandler  When was the last time you saw her wear it?
Ross  Well, she wore it all Christmas day, and then uh
Chandler  Big dog?
[Scene  Chandler and Joey's, Joey is repacking the furniture into boxes to return it.]
Ross  (entering) Hey!
Joey  Hey!
Ross  What are you doing?
Joey  Im sending back all this stuff that Chandler bought out of guilt.
Ross  Everything? Even the TV?
Joey  No! Im putting that in my room.
Ross  Listen, Joey, I know what he did was wrong but dont you think you
could at least hear the guy out?
Joey  Back when you and Rachel were together, if Chandler had kissed her, would
you hear him out?
Ross  Thats a good point. So uh, how long are you gonna punish him?
Joey  Five years.
Ross  Youve sentenced him?!
Joey  Hey! Dont do the crime if you cant do the time.
Ross  Joey, the guys your best friend.
Joey  No, was my best friend. Anyway, I dont know why
youre pushing for him so hard. With him out of the way as my best friend,
theres a spot open.
Ross  Oh, who? Me?
Joey  Yeah!
Ross  Wow! Im honored! And yknow what Im gonna do as my first
act as your best friend?
Joey  What?
Ross  Im gonna get you to talk to Chandler.
Joey  All right. But if you werent my best friend.
[Scene  Central Perk, Chandler and Kathy are sitting at a table and talking about
Joey.]
Kathy  Oh my God, is it really that bad?
Chandler  I walk into a room and he wont even talk to me, he just mumbles
something in Italian. And I know he only knows the bad words.
Joey  (entering) Hey Gunther, have you uh, have you seen Chandler?
Gunther  I thought you were Chandler. But umm, one of who is over
there.
Kathy  Oh.
Chandler  Hey Joe.
Joey  (Something in Italian.) (Storms out.)
[Scene  Dr. Burkes office, Rachel and Monica are waiting as the doctor arrives.]
Doctor  Ill be right with you. Okay? (to the nurse) Thanks, Wendy.
Monica  Oh my God! How cute is the on-call doctor?
Rachel  Ooh, so cute, that Im thinking about jamming this pen in my eye.
Nurse  Dr. Burke will see you know.
Monica  Oh no-no-no, not Dr. Burke. Dr. Burke is out of town. The-the on-call
doctor will see me now.
Nurse  Dr. Richard Burke is out of town. Dr. Timothy Burke, his son, will see
you now.
Dr. Timothy Burke  Ready?
[Scene  Chandler and Joey's, Joey is packing as Chandler rushes in.]
Chandler  Hey! Im sorry! That(sees that Joey is about to leave)
where are you going?
Joey  My folks.
Chandler  Oh, uh, when-when are you coming back?
Joey  I dont know. I might stay there for a few days while I look for an
apartment.
Chandler  What?!
Joey  Yeah, yknow at first I thought we could talk about this yknow,
work it out, but uh, seeing you two together I dont think I
Chandler  Hey, look, what do you want me to say? Do you want me to say that
Ill stop seeing her?
Joey  Look, its not about her. Okay? But seeing you two together just
reminds me of what you did. And I dont want to live with some one who doesnt
know what it is to be a friend. So, Ill see ya. (He starts to leave, but Chandler
grabs his bag and stops him.)
Chandler  Hey, look, I know what it is to be a friend, I just-I just screwed up!
Joey  Yeah! You did! And thats why Im leaving.
Chandler  All right look, if youre not gonna stay for me, then at least
stay for them! Okay, they have had a very difficult year! What with the
robbery and all!
Joey  When that guy was robbing us, and I was locked in the entertainment unit
for like six hours, you know what I was doing in there all that time? I was thinking about
how I let you down!
Chandler  What?
Joey  Yeah! But if wouldve know what kind of friend you were gonna turn
out to be, I wouldnt have worried about it so much! See you around!
Chandler  All right, wait! Come on! Just wait one second! There has to be
something that I can do! Something! If we still had that entertainment unit I would get in
it for six hours and think about how I let you down. (Joey looks intrigued) What?
Joey  Weve got a box. (Motions to a large wooden box next to him.)
[Scene  Dr. Burkes office, Tim is examining Monica.]
Tim  Last time I saw you, it was the morning I left for college. And you were
just standing outside The Dairy Queen.
Monica  I was probably waiting for it to open.
Tim  I gotta tell you, you look great now.
Monica  You look great too.
Tim  Youre an excellent patient!
Monica  So how does it look?
Tim  Well, youve got a little scratch on your cornea, your gonna have to
wear a patch for a couple of days.
Monica  Like a pirate?!
Tim  If that helps you.
Monica  Umm, so how long have you been working with your dad? (He looks at her)
Come on, one of us had to mention him.
Tim  I moved back here a couple of months ago.
Monica  Oh. Big family dinner tonight?
Tim  Uh. (He holds up a brown lunch bag.)
Monica  No way!
Tim  I was gonna have Thanksgiving at my girlfriends.
Monica  (disappointed) Oh.
Tim  But we broke up.
Monica  (happy) Oh.
Tim  She-she wasnt ready for a serious commitment.
Monica  (sympathetic) Oh. (in a pirates voice) So you made her walk the
plank? Aye, matie?
Tim  Youre not wearing the patch yet.
Monica  I know.
[Scene  Monica and Rachel's, Its closer to dinner. Monica has just told everyone
that Tim is coming to dinner.]
Ross  Hes coming here for Thanksgiving!
Rachel  I know, its sick.
Monica  Why is it sick?
Rachel  Because its Richards son! Its like inviting Greek
tragedy over for dinner!
Monica  Hey, come on, Phoebe, you understand dont you?
Phoebe  Yeah, I can see where Id be your best shot but, no. Im
sorry, but I think its twisted.
Ross  Yeah.
Joey  (coming out of the bathroom) Whats twisted?
Monica  Me going out with Richards son.
Joey  Ewwwww!! Ew! Ew! Ew!
Chandler  (He is now in the box, in their living room.) Sounds like a really bad
idea to me.
Rachel  Is he okay in there?
Joey  Hes fine!
Ross  Hey, y'know, Mon, if things wrong out between you and Richards son,
youd be able to tell your kids, that you slept with their grandfather.
Monica  Fine! Judge all you want to but, (points to Ross) married a lesbian,
(points to Rachel) left a man at the altar, (points to Phoebe) fell in love with a gay ice
dancer, (points to Joey) threw a girls wooden leg in a fire, (points to Chandler)
livin in a box!! (goes to her room)
Rachel  So now, what exactly is the point of the box?
Joey  Chandler?
Chandler  The meaning of the box is three fold. One (holds a finger up through
the air hole), it gives me the time to think about what I did. Two (holds up another
finger), it proves how much I care about my friendship with Joey. And three (holds up a
third finger), it hurts!
Ross  (to Rachel) Oh hey! Hey uh, you remember the necklace I gave you last
year? Can I see it?
Rachel  (worried) Why?
Ross  I just wanna check something.
Rachel  Okay. (She goes into her bedroom)
Ross  (He puts his hand over the hole on the box.) (to Chandler) Now, well
see.
Chandler  Air hole! Air hole!! (Ross retracts his hand quickly.)
Rachel  (coming out of her bedroom with a necklace) Here it is! I love it. I
wear it all the time.
Ross  (grabbing the necklace) The necklace I got you was gold, this one is
silver.
Rachel  Huh, well maybe it uh, it changed.
Ross  Oh my God! You actually exchanged it!
Rachel  Well isnt it better that I exchanged it for something that I enjoy
and that I can get a lot of use out of?
Ross  What did you get?
Rachel  Credit.
Monica  (running in from her bedroom) Ill get it! Ill get it!
Ill get it! Ill get it! Ill get it! Ill get it! Ill get it!
Ill get it! Ill get it! Ill get it! Ill get it! Ill get it!
Ill get it! Ill get it! (opens the door) Hi, Tim.
Tim  Hi. (gives her a bottle of wine)
Monica  Thank you. Come meet my friends. This is uh, Phoebe.
Tim  Hi, nice to meet you.
Monica  And Joey.
Joey  Hey!
Tim  Hi, Joey.
Monica  My brother, Ross.
Ross  Hey.
Monica  And Rachel. (Chandler clears his voice loudly) And thats Chandler.
Chandler  How do ya do.
Tim  Whats
Monica  Umm, well, hes
Joey  Hes doin some thinkin!
Chandler  What happened? What happened?!
Joey  You kissed my girlfriend!
Rachel  Ooh, I like those sunglasses.
Ross  Like em, like em? Or, Id like to get store credit for
that amount like em?
Rachel  (Swears in Italian, its the same term used by Joey earlier and
Joey nods his approval.)
Monica  All right everybody, this turkey is ready!
Tim  Where can I wash up?
Monica  Here, let me show you. Okay, the towels are hanging next to the sink,
and umm, you can use the fancy soap.
Tim  Thank you.
Rachel  Fancy soap? I thought we were savin that for the Pope!
Monica  See hes nice. Right?
Phoebe  Yeah, but Monica, do you actually want to be in a relationship where you
can actually use the phrase, "Thats not how your dad used to do it."
Tim  Wow! Everything looks great! Where should I sit?
Monica  I saved you a seat. (Motions to the one next to her.)
Rachel  (pouring the wine) Sick-sick-sick-sick.
Phoebe  Oh, Ill get it. (goes over to the door.)
Chandler  Gotcha! (laughs)
Joey  That doesnt sound like thinking to me!
Chandler  Sorry!
Joey  Yknow I dont think you should be talking at all in there! I
think youve got to much thinking to do to be talking and making jokes!
Chandler  Okay, okay, you got it!
Rachel  Ross, can you pass me the yams?
Ross  Sure! Oh, and Joeys got the mashed potatoes if you want to exchange
them.
Rachel  Would you stop?! What is the matter with you?!
Monica  Oh-ho-ho, weve got company.
Ross  Theres nothing the matter with me. See, Im not completely
devoid of sentiment, see I have feelings.
Rachel  Okay, fine. (She gets up and walks into her bedroom)
Chandler  You cant tell, but Im trying to break the tension by
mooning you guys!
Joey  All right, look! If this is just a big joke to you, then forget about it,
all right?! This means something to me! And if it doesnt mean anything to you, then
you should get out of there, otherwise youre just an idiot in a box!
Chandler  Youre right, and Im sorry! This means a lot to me! I want
you to be my friend again! I swear, I wont say another word tonight.
Joey  So are you gonna start taking this thing seriously?
Chandler  Absolutely!
Joey  That sounds like another word to me! Are you gonna take this seriously?
(Theres no response from Chandler.) Okay.
Rachel  Dont say that I have no sentiment! (Starts to show Ross
whats in the box.) This is a movie stub from our first date! This is an eggshell
from the first time you made me breakfast in bed! (Holds up a bone) This is from the
museum from the first time we were together. Okay, maybe I exchange gifts sometimes,
but I keep the things that matter!
Ross  I dont know what to say, Im sorry. Though, youre not
supposed to take these. (Points to the bone) Its like a million years old, we, we
actually, we had people looking for that.
Monica  (putting off her coat) Ooh, this always happens. (Her coat gets stuck.)
Tim  Here, let me help. (Does so.)
Monica  Thank you.
Tim  You-you have a very beautiful eye.
Monica  Yknow all my friends think this is weird.
Tim  Yknow I-I thought it was gonna be weird, I mean I almost called and
canceled, but it really isnt.
Monica  I know! I mean its like me and your dad, thats a totally
separate thing.
Tim  Oh, I totally agree.
Monica  Were just two people who find each other very attractive. Right?
Tim  What?
Monica  Nothing. Nothing.
Tim  No-no really, was-was that not okay?
Monica  No-no-no that was good, it was, that was uh, that was a goood kiss
Tim  Oh my God! It didnt remind you of
Monica  (interrupting) Dont say it!
Tim  No, but it did! Didnt it?!
Monica  Yeah!
Tim  Oh man!!
Monica  I know!
Joey  Ill get it. (Its Kathy.)
Kathy  (sees its Joey) Oh.
Joey  Hey.
Kathy  Hey. Listen, I want you to know how sorry I am
Joey  Thats okay. Chandlers the one Im mad at.
Kathy  Well, Im still sorry. Is he here?
Joey  In the box.
Kathy  (going over to the box) Chandler?
Phoebe  Oh, he-he cant talk right now.
Kathy  Why not? Whats going on?
Phoebe  Hes just trying to show Joey how much he means to him.
Kathy  By being in a box?
Rachel  Joey, had reasons.
Phoebe  They were threefold.
Kathy  Oh. Well uh, (to Chandler) you not being able to talk may make
this easier. Listen umm (She looks at the gang who are watching, they take the hint
and leave them alone.) Listen I dont wanna be someone who comes between two best
friends. I just, I cant stand seeing what this is doing to you guys, and I
dont wanna be the cause of that. So, I dont think we can see each other
anymore. Im gonna go to my moms in Chicago, Im gonna stay there for
awhile. I think this couldve be something really amazing, but yknow this is
probably for the best. Yknow? Im gonna miss you. Good-bye, Chandler.
Joey  (starting to cry) Open the box!! (Runs over to do so.)
Rachel  What?!
Joey  He can still catch her! Come on, get out of there! (He opens the box) Get
out of there!
Chandler  So?
Joey  Yeah, were gonna be fine! Get out!
Chandler  Yeah?
Joey  Yeah, you did some real good thinkin in there.
Chandler  Man, this is
Joey  Now go! Cause you can still catch her! And Merry Christmas from
youre secret Santa! (Chandler runs out and closes the door.)
Joey  All right, who got Chandler? Cause I uh, need to trade.
[Scene  Monica and Rachel's Balcony, the gang is all there watching Chandler.]
Rachel  Oh, he sees her!
Monica  Oh, hes catching up to her!
Phoebe  Oh, she sees him! Oh, theyre hugging!
Ross  Hes taking her purse!
Joey  Uhh, thats not them. Im gonna go call the police.
Phoebe  Oh, there they are!
Phoebe  All right, get a room.
[Scene  Outside Central Perk, Monica and Phoebe are showing everyone the van they
bought for the catering business. Its an old Dodge van, that has a cartoon woman
riding on a dragon painted on the side of it.]
Phoebe  Okay!
Monica  Come on, no peeking! (They are leading the gang out with there hands
over their eyes.)
Chandler  Our eyes are closed and were about to cross the street. Very
good.
Phoebe  Okayyyyy, open up!
Ross  What did you want to show us? Because all I can see is this bitchin'
van!
Phoebe  Yeah, its for our catering business!
Joey  I think I know that girl.
Monica  All right, umm, were not gonna really keep it this way though.
Rachel  No?
Phoebe  No, were gonna paint over the sword, and replace it with a
baguette.
Rachel  Oh!
Phoebe  And also, we dont know what to do with this. (She turns on a
switch and the girls nipples light up.)
Joey  Oh yeah, I definitely know her.
[Scene  Monica and Rachel's, the gang is all there.]
Monica  (to Phoebe) Remember that guy from cooking school I told you about that
put cilantro with everything?
Phoebe  Oh sure, Cilantro Larry.
Monica  Well, Im gonna fill in for him as food critic for the Chelsea
Reporter.
Monica  Wow, Monica! What an amazing opportunity to influence dozens of
people.
Phoebe  How could you say yes, what about our catering business?
Monica  Oh no-no-no, its only one night a week, and plus I get to take all
of you out for a lot of free dinners.
All  Yay!!
Phoebe  Oh, in that case(hops up and down in joy)Yay! (Monica looks
confused) That was me hopping on board.
Monica  Oh.
Chandler  (entering) Hey, you guys! Hey, Ross, quick question for ya. Are you
ready to party?
Ross  I dont know, I could maybe go out for a couple of beers, but
theres this thing about bumblebees on The Discovery Channel that I was
planning to watch.
Chandler  No-no, I dont think you heard me. Are you ready to party?!
Ross  Nooo!! Gandolf?! Gandolf is coming to town?
Chandler  Kathys with her parents, I have nothing to do, so tomorrow we
are partying with Gandolf dude!
Ross  Dude, we are sooo gonna party!
Phoebe  Wow! Okay, dude alert! And who is this guy?
Ross  Mike "Gandolf" Ganderson, only like the funest guy in the world.
Chandler  Im gonna call and get off work tomorrow!
Ross  Im gonna call after you!
Chandler  This is gonna be soo cool, dude, we never party anymore!
Chandler and Ross  Woooo!!!
Monica  All right, were you guys smoking something in the back of our van?
Joey  Really. And what do you mean you never have fun anymore? You have fun with
me, remember that time we saw those strippers and you paid me 50 bucks to eat that book?
Ross  Joey, you are gonna love this guy. Gandolf is like the party wizard!
Joey  Well, why do you call him Gandolf?
Ross  Gandolf the wizard. (Joey is still confused) Hello! Didnt you read Lord
of the Rings in high school?
Joey  No, I had sex in high school.
[Scene  Rachels office, Rachel and Sophie are sitting at their desks working as
Joanna walks in.]
Rachel  Oh, uh, Joanna I was wondering if I could ask you something.
Theres an opening for an assistant buyer in Junior Miss
Joanna  (interrupting) Okay, but that would actually be a big step down for me.
Rachel  Well, actually, I meant for me. The hiring committee is meeting people
all day and
Joanna  Oh. Well, I wish I could say no, but you cant stay my assistant
forever. Neither can you Sophie, but for different reasons.
Rachel  God, I am so glad you dont have a problem with this, because if
you did, I wouldnt even consider applying.
Joanna  Really? Well, in that case
Rachel  (interrupting) And thats Im so glad theres no
problem.
Joanna  Thats fine, actually Im on the hiring committee, so
therell be at least one friendly face.
Rachel  Ohh! Thats great!
Joanna  You know, Junior Miss is where I started. Oh, I had to sleep with the ugliest
guy to get that job.
Rachel  Really?!
Joanna  No-ho-ho! (pause) Yeah. (pause) I mean, no-no-no-no-no, dont you
worry, Im sure with your qualifications you wont need to sleep with some guy
to get that job. Although, I might need some convincing.
Rachel  Well, I, umm
Joanna  Kidding! God, I feel wild today!
[Scene  Chandler and Joey's, Chandler is getting ready to party.]
Chandler  Oh man! I am so excitedI may vomit!
Joey  Will you calm down, hes just a human guy.
Chandler  Look you dont understand, Gandolf is amazing. Yknow
youre never know whats gonna end up happening, you go out for a couple of
beers and end up on a fishing boat to Nova Scotia!
Joey  Really?!
Chandler  Oh yeah, its beautiful country up there.
Ross  (entering) Hey! Okay! I got my passport, fresh socks, and a snake bite
kit!
Chandler  Its not gonna be exactly like last time.
Joey  All right, Ill see you guys.
Chandler and Ross  Whoa-whoa-whoa!
Chandler  Whoa-wh-wh-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa!
Joey  I have an audition, but Ill definitely hook up with you later. Where
are you gonna be around noon?
Ross  Somewhere maybe along the equator?
Joey  Okay. (leaves as the phone rings)
Chandler  (answering it) Hello. (listens) (to Ross) Its Gandolf!!! (on
phone) So, are you in town? (listens) (disappointed) Oh, well, well maybe next time then.
(Hangs up)
Ross  What happened?
Chandler  Hes not gonna make it, hes stuck in Chicago.
Ross  Ohh, man! Chicago, is sooo lucky!
Chandler  Stupid, useless Canadian money!
[Scene  Bloomingdales, Rachel is meeting with Mr. Posner, Mrs. Lynch,
and Joanna the hiring committee.]
Mr. Posner  You have a very impressive resume, Ms. Green. I especially like what
I see here about implementing a new filing system.
Rachel  Thank you.
Joanna  Filing system? Oh-oh! You mean those-those little colored labels you put
on all the folders? (to the committee) It certainly did brighten up the inside of the
filing cabinets.
Rachel  Well, they uh, they-they do more than that.
Mrs. Lynch  I notice that youve been trusted with a lot of rather
important responsibilities.
Rachel  Yes, Joanna really has been an incredible mentor to me.
Joanna  Oh. And Rachel has been really incredible in getting my morning bagel
for me. Its amazing how she gets it right almost every time!
Rachel  I-I-I of course, I have more responsibilities than that.
Joanna  Oh yes, well theres the coffee too. (to the committee) Rachel can
carry two things at once!
Mr. Posner  Yes, thats very good. Now a uh, big part of this job is
cultivating personal relationships, especially with designers.
Rachel  Yes, I realize that
Joanna  (interrupting) And Rachel shouldnt have any problem with that. The
only problem might be getting a little too friendly, if you know what I mean.
Rachel  I love working with designers!
Joanna  With them, under them, whats the difference? Eh, Rach?
[Scene  Monica and Rachel's, Phoebe is there as Monica enters carrying a huge stack of
newspapers.]
Monica  Hey! My first review is out!
Phoebe  Ohh! Oh, the Chelsea Reporter, ohh, this used to keep me so warm.
Monica  All right, look at my on the back page.
Phoebe  Oh, okay! (reading) "Would I go back to Allesandros? Sure,
but Id have to order two meals, one for me and one for the guy pointing the gun to
my head." (to Monica) Wow! You really laid into this place.
Monica  Hey, they dont pay me a penny a word to make friends.
Phoebe  Ooh, I gotta go. I found a guy that who could fix up the van for
catering.
Monica  Oh! Do you need me to go with you?
Phoebe  No-no, its okay. But are we sure we dont want the waterbed?
Monica  Havent we made this decision?
Phoebe  Yeah, all right. (starts to leave)
Monica  Bye!
Phoebe  Bye!
Monica  (answering it) Who is it?
Allesandro  Its Allesandro, from Allesandros.
Monica  Oh my God.
Allesandro  I want to talk to you about your review.
Monica  Oh my God, oh my God. (on intercom) Call me on the phone!
Allesandro  Why? So you could hang up on me?
Monica  Look, I-Im never gonna let you up so you may as well just go away.
Allesandro  Just give me a chance too
Phoebe  (on intercom) Hey, do you need to get in? Here you go.
Monica  No! Phoebe!
Phoebe  Hey, Monica!
[Scene  Monica and Rachel's, continued from earlier.]
Allesandro  (entering) I want a retraction! Our food is not
inedible swill!
Monica  I couldnt eat it! I had five friends who couldnt eat it, and
one of them eats books.
Allesandro  Well our service is not grossly incompetent.
Monica  The waiter carried the breadsticks in his pants!
Allesandro  Well, you said that we except the Discover Card, which we
do not!
Monica  All right, that Ill retract. But I stand by my review, I know food
and that wasnt it. Youre marinara sauce tasted like tomato juice! You should
serve it with vodka and a piece of celery.
Allesandro  Hey! Im proud of that sauce, its delicious.
Monica  Oh my God! You own an Italian restaurant and you think that tastes
good?! Where are you even from?
Allesandro  (shyly) Lebanon.
Monica  Hand me those tomatoes, Im gonna show you what it should taste
like! Come on, hand me them.
Allesandro  How long is this gonna take? Cause I got another critic to go
yell at.
[Scene  Rachels office, Rachel is confronting Joanna about her interview.]
Rachel  (entering Joannas office) Umm, Joanna? I wanna talk about that
interview.
Joanna  I thought it went very well.
Rachel  No! It didnt! Thats what I want to talk to you about.
(starts to break up) Now, just to brief you (starts to cry) I may cry, but they are
not tears of sadness or of anger, but just of me having this discussion with you.
Joanna  Rachel, please, dont make a scene.
Rachel  Theres nobody here!
Joanna  Sophie, get in here! (Sophie enters) You see! Now youre making
Sophie uncomfortable!
Sophie  Shes not making me uncomfortable.
Joanna  Congratulations! You now just crossed the line into completely useless.
Get out. (Sophie starts to cry and leaves)
Rachel  Do you want me to quit?
Joanna  What?! What would make you think that?
Rachel  Well of those things that you said in the interview, I mean if you
believe any of them, I must not be a very good assistant. Yknow what? I
am just gonna pack up my desk, (She goes over to get all of her belongings from the desk,
which amount to a muffin and a pen) and I will be gone by the end of the day! (Realizes
she has nothing.) Well, I guess theres no use to me sticking around til the
end of the day! (Starts to leave.)
Joanna  Wait-wait-wait-wait! You can put your sad little muffin back in
its drawer. If you must know the truth, I didnt want to lose a perfectly good
assistant.
Rachel  What?
Joanna  Thats why I said all those things about your flirting and your
drinking
Rachel  My drinking?
Joanna  Oh, I mustve said that after you left.
Rachel  Said what? Exactly.
Joanna  That you enjoyed the occasional drinking binge.
Rachel  Oh my God!! Ohh, that is it! Im leaving! You are just a horrible
person!
Joanna  Wait-wait-wait-wait-wait-wait-wait-wait!! If youre gonna get all
sensitive about it! I dont want to lose you. What if I, create a position for you?
Ill make you an assistant buyer in this department.
Rachel  Say more things like that.
Joanna  You can have your own office, and a raise! Effective tomorrow.
Rachel  Id need an expense account.
Joanna  Done!
Rachel  And an assistant.
Joanna  Sophie, get in here! (Sophie peeks in around the corner)
[Scene  Chandler and Joey's, Ross and Chandler are watching TV as Joey enters.]
Joey  Hey! What are you guys doing here? I thought youd be out partying
with Gandel-worf.
Ross  Its Gandolf, and hes not coming.
Joey  So youve been sittin around here all mornin?
Ross  No! I balanced my checkbook.
Chandler  Yeah, and I-I gave first names to all of the foosball players.
Ross  I cant believe he didnt come!
Joey  So what if he didnt come! We can still go out and party ourselves!
Chandler  Oh-no, yknow with Gandolf wed be out all
night!
Ross  Yeah! Wed meet, wed meet total strangers, and hang out with
them!
Joey  Well, we could do that!
Ross  Theres other stuff too.
Joey  Well do it all, and better! Look, after tonight, Gandolf will want
to party with us, dude! Come on!
Ross  Yeah!
Joey  Yeah!
Ross  Yeah!!
Joey  Yeah!!
Ross  Its not like we dont know how to party!!
Joey  Yeah! All right? Lets go!
Chandler  And may-maybe we could end up on a boat again?
Joey and Ross  Yeah!!!
Chandler  All right!!
Ross  (to Chandler) Hey-hey-hey, when uh, when were we on a boat?
Chandler  Remember that really cold morning, you woke up and those dogs were
licking your face?
Ross  Yeah.
Chandler  Well, those were seals, man.
[Scene  Monica and Rachel's, Rachel is entering, excited.]
Rachel  Hey Mon, little question for ya! How do you think this suit will look on
an assistant buyer?
Monica  Okay, the owner of Allesandros came over to yell at me, but
instead I made him some sauce, and he offered me the job as head chef!!
Rachel  Oh my God!! You just ruined the thing I was practicing the whole way
home, but Im soo happy!
Monica  Can you believe it? I finally get to run my own kitchen!
Rachel  Ohh, youve waited soo long.
Phoebe  (entering) Hey!
Rachel  Hey, Pheebs, quick question for ya.
Phoebe  Yeah.
Rachel  How do you think this suit would look on an assistant buyer at Bloomingdales?
Phoebe  I dont know, it would totally depend on her coloring and
(realizes) You got the job!!
Rachel  Yes!!!
Monica  You got the job?! Why didnt you tell me?
Rachel  Ohh, its gonna be so great! Im gonna get to help decide what
we sell, Im gonna have an office with walls and everything. (turns to Monica)
Im gonna have walls!
Phoebe  Okay, is this the day of good news or what? I got us a job! The wedding
reception.
Monica  Ohh! Umm, Phoebe, I kinda need to talk to you about that. (Rachel
excuses herself) Umm, well I-I-I think it might be time for me to take a step back from
catering.
Phoebe  But weve only had one job.
Monica  I know, but now we have this second one and it just, it feels like
its snowballing, yknow?
Phoebe  Yeah! What are you saying?
Monica  I got offered the head chef job at Allesandros.
Phoebe  What?
Monica  Its okay, cause y'know what? You dont really need me
for the business.
Phoebe  Youre the cook! With out you its just me driving up to
peoples houses with empty trays and asking for money!
Monica  All right. But umm, I-I-Ill pay you back all the money you
invested, and you can keep the van.
Phoebe  For what? I cant believe this! I gotta get out of here. (leaves)
Monica  Phoebe, wait a minute! (runs after her, leaving Rachel alone)
Rachel  Im an assistant buyer!!
[Scene  Central Perk, Joey, Ross, and Chandler are making a pit stop on their party
tour.]
Joey  All right, so well get a little coffee, and get energized, and
well head back out.
Chandler  Yeah, all right.
Ross  Okay.
Joey  So, were having fun, right?
Chandler and Ross  Yeah.
Joey  We dont need that wizard guy. We hit a couple of clubs, talked to
some strangers, and uh, after this, well head down to the docks and see about that
boat thing.
Ross  Im kinda beat.
Chandler  Actually, me too.
Joey  Are you serious?!
Chandler and Ross  Yeah.
Joey  Thank God! Im exhausted!
Gunther  So you guys want coffees?
Joey  Yeah, but uh, I dont want to be up too late, so uh, Ill have a
decaf.
Ross  Yeah, me too.
Chandler  Actually, can I get some hot water with a little lemon? I think I
strained my voice screaming in there. Does it have to be so loud?
Joey  I cant hear a word youre saying, my ears are ringing so bad.
Ross  Im just glad I brought that extra pair of socks, yknow? I used
them as mittens, I didnt want to touch a thing in that last place.
Ross  How sad are we?
Joey  Yeah, I know.
Chandler  Yknow what? Were not sad, were not sad, were
just not 21 anymore. Yknow? Im 29 years old, damnit! And I want to sit in a
comfortable chair, and watch television and go to bed at a reasonable hour!
Joey and Ross  Yeah!
Joey  Yeah! And I like to hang out in a quiet place where I can talk to my
friends.
Chandler and Ross  Yeah!
Ross  And so what if I like to go home, throw on some Kenny G, and take a bath!
Joey  Were 29, were not women.
[Scene  Central Perk, the next day, Phoebe is there.]
Monica  (entering) Ohh, here you are. Yknow, Im-Im glad you
decided to hear me out.
Phoebe  Okay, Im hearing.
Monica  Ive been doing a lot of thinking. A lot! And umm, well, I came up
with a whole bunch of businesses you can do with your van. Okay umm, you could be flower
delivery person.
Phoebe  What?!
Monica  Or! A bakery delivery person.
Phoebe  I wa-I wa-I wa
Monica  Pizza?!
Phoebe  Monica!
Monica  All right, Ive got a whole bunch of uh-uh, stuff in this area, but
umm, Im getting the feeling that you dont want to deliver.
Phoebe  No.
Monica  Okay. Im guessing that if you dont want to deliver, you
probably dont want to pick stuff up either.
Phoebe  No.
Monica  Yknow what, lets do the catering business.
Phoebe  Really?! Are you sure?
Monica  Yeah, y'know I-I made a commitment to you. Yknow what, itd
be, itd be fun.
Phoebe  Oh! It will be fun! Ohh! Yay! Oh! Okay, ooh, lets
plan the wedding reception. (She grabs the notebook which Monica used for her ideas and
starts flipping page after page after page after page after page to find a blank one.)
Wow! You really wanted me to do something with this van. (pause)
Yknow what, I want you to take the chef job.
Monica  Really?!
Phoebe  Yeah. Thats what you really want. Yeah, I dont want to be
the reason youre unhappy, that would just make me unhappy, and I really
dont want to be the reason Im unhappy.
Monica  Thank you.
Phoebe  Besides, it might be kinda fun to form the new A-Team.
[Scene  Rachels office, she is coming in for the day carrying a picture for her
new office. Mrs. Lynch is coming out of Joannas office, carrying a box.]
Rachel  Oh, hi Mrs. Lynch! Is Joanna in already?
Mrs. Lynch  Oh my goodness! You havent heard!
Rachel  Heard what?
Mrs. Lynch  Joanna passed away last night.
Rachel  Oh my God! How?!
Mrs. Lynch  Well, she was leaving work and she was hit by a cab.
Rachel  Oh my God! Oh, I cannot believe it!
Mrs. Lynch  I know!
Rachel  Oh, God. Oh, God. (gets worried) Oh God.
Mrs. Lynch  I didnt realize that she was so close.
Rachel  Yes, so close. Mrs. Lynch, I know that this is an
emotional and difficult time, for all of us. But by any chance did Joanna send any
paperwork your way before it happened.
Mrs. Lynch  No. Nothing. Imagine, if she had just stepped off that curb a few
seconds later.
Rachel  Yes-yes, just a few seconds and shed still be with usnothing
about an assistant buyer?
Mrs. Lynch  (starting to cry) No, Im sorry. I have to go. (She leaves as
Sophie arrives.)
Sophie  (happily) Good morning!
Rachel  Oh, Sophie, I guess you didnt hear about Joanna
Sophie  I sure did! (smiles)
[Scene  Monicas new kitchen, Allesandro is introducing her to her new employees.]
Allesandro  Im so excited about having Monica come on board with us.
Although I do feel bad about having fired chef Emillio, its like losing a member of
the family. Of course, that literally is the case for several of you.
Tony, Carlos, Marie, please, tell your father how much were gonna miss him. Now, I
know that Monica has a lot of great ideas for this place, well, you all read the review.
So without much further ado, I present to you our new head chef.
Monica   Umm, I just wanna say, uh (reads from a 3 X 5 card) that with a
pinch of exictement, a dash of hard work, a dollup of cooperation, we can have the
recipe... (Looks up and sees eveyone glaring at her) Are you gonna kill me?
[Scene  Chandler and Joey's, Joey, Chandler, and Phoebe are there as Ross enters.]
Ross  Hey!
Chandler, Joey, and Phoebe  Hey!
Ross  Im sorry Im late, did I miss anything?
Phoebe  Joey stuffing 15 Oreos in his mouth. (Joey, with an obvious
mouth full, nods yes.)
Ross  15? (Joey nods again) Your personal best! (Ross takes an Oreo and
Joey mumbles, no!)
Phoebe  Where were you?
Ross  Oh, on a date. Yeah, I met this girl on the train going to a museum
upstate.
Chandler  Oh, yeah! How did you meet her?
Phoebe  Oh, which museum?
Phoebe  (just Phoebe) No, answer his.
Ross  Okay, it was just me and her at the back of the train, and I sat near the
door, so shed have to pass by me if she wanted to switch cars. She was totally at my
mercy.
Chandler  Were you so late because you were burring this woman?
Ross  No, Im getting back down cause she lives in Poughkeepsie. She
seems really great, but shes like totally great, but she lives two and a half hours
away.
Chandler  How can she be great if shes from Poughkeepsie? (laughs, at they
all look at him) That joke wouldve killed in Albany.
Joey  Done! I did it! Heh, whos stupid now? (He smiles and has cookie
remains all over his teeth.)
[Scene  Central Perk, Chandler, Joey, Rachel, and Phoebe are there.]
Chandler  Hey, look at this! (Holding a newspaper) Theyre lighting the big
Christmas tree tonight.
Phoebe  Umm, that papers two weeks old.
Chandler  All right, who keeps leaving old newspapers in the trash?! I really
wanted to take Kathy to this, I cant believe I missed it.
Rachel  Hey, yknow, at least you have somebody to miss that stuff with! I hate
being alone this time of year! Next thing you know itll be Valentines Day,
then my birthday, then bang!before you know it, theyre lighting that damn tree
again. Ohh, I want somebody! (hearing this, Gunther moves in)
Yknow, I want a man!! (Gunther leaves depressed) I mean, it
doesnt even have to be a big relationship, yknow, just like a fling would be
great.
Chandler  Really?! I didnt think girls ever just wanted a fling.
Rachel  Well, believe me, its been a long time since Ive been flung.
Joey  Well, I know what Im giving you for Christmas.
Chandler  Yknow what? Theres some nice guys at my office, do you
want me to set you up?
Rachel  Yeah! Wait a minute, its been a long time that Ive been
single. How come you never offered this before?
Chandler  Well, I have a girlfriend, Im-Im happy. So, I no longer
feel the need to go out of my way to stop others from being happy.
Rachel  Okay! No accountants. Oh, and no one from like legal. I dont like
guys with boring jobs.
Chandler  Oh and Ross was like what? A lion tamer?
All  Hey!
Phoebe  Whats wrong Mon?
Monica  Ohh, everybody at the restaurant still hates me.
Phoebe  Oh.
Monica  I thought I was making headway, everyone was smiling at me all day, I
get off work and I find out that they wrote this (puts on her chef hat) on my chefs
hat. (The hat says Quit, bitch)
Phoebe  Hey, maybe they meant to write, Quiet, bitch.
Rachel  Hey, honey! Whats the matter? (Monica shows her, her hat.) Fine, I
was just trying to be nice! Whoa!
Monica  I mean I have not been picked on this much since kindergarten and they
had to bring in someone from junior high to do the see-saw with me. (Joey laughs and
Monica glares at him.)
Joey  Ohhh!
Monica  I mean theyre trying to do everything they can to make me quit,
and if there were any other job, I would. But this is something Ive been waiting for
my whole life.
Rachel  Well, wait a minute, youre the boss! Why dont you just yell
at them? Or, fire them?
Monica  I would love too, but I cant! I mean I just cant, you know
that Im not good at confrontation.
Chandler  Hey, you know what you can do? I remember reading about this director,
I think it was Orson Wells, who at the beginning of the movie would hire somebody, just so
he could fire them in front of everybody. Then they would all know, whos boss.
Joey  Hey, Mon! Im not doing anything, why dont you fire me?
Monica  Thats a good idea! Wait, do you know how to waiter?
Joey  Good enough to get fired.
Monica  All right, youre hired!
Joey  Hey! That must be why I got fired last week! Does this Orson Wells guy
direct Burger King commercials?
Chandler  (he glares at him for a while) Yes.
[Scene  Chandlers office, he is trying to find Rachel a date.]
Chandler  I say, Drew! Are you seeing anybody right now? (Drew looks at him)
Og-ee-op, Im not asking for me, Im I mean No, Im-Im
not gay, Im not asking you out. Im not-Im not-Im not gay!
Drew  I didnt think you were gay. I do now.
Chandler  See my friend-my friend, Rachel, she wants to be set up.
Drew  Ahh, I just got out of a big relationship, Im not looking for any
thing serious.
Chandler  Oh, yknow what, that might be okay even if it was just kind of a
fling, that might be all right with Rachel.
Mike  Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa! Is this, hot Rachel, that you took to the Christmas
party, Rachel?
Chandler  (to Drew) Oh, by the way, that is her full name.
Mike  Oh wow! Im free for her!
Drew  Oh, wait a second! I didnt say I wasnt free!
Mike  Hey, Chandler, why dont we talk this over at the Ranger game
tomorrow?
Drew  Hold on, yknow I just got a box of Cubans, maybe I
bring them by your office around uh, five?
Chandler  Oh well, thats uh, a little later than I uh, generally care to
stay, but sure!
Mike  Maybe, before the game we could enjoy some eight year old some small batch
Basel Hadens.
Chandler  Well, I dont really know what that is, but lets!!
[Scene  Monica and Rachel's, Phoebe is working on a new song.]
Phoebe  Hey! You guys, Im writing a holiday song for everyone. Do you want
to hear it?
Monica, Rachel, and Joey  Yes!
Phoebe  (singing) Happy Chanukah, Monica! May your Christmas be snowy, Joey!
Happy New Year, Chandler and Ross. Spin the draddle, Rachel!
Rachel  Pheebs, thats great!
Phoebe  Oh, yay!
Rachel  But yknow umm, Rachel doesnt rhyme with draddle.
Phoebe  I know but its so hard! Nothing rhymes with your stupid name!
Joey  What are you talking about? Lots of things rhyme with Rachel. Bagel. Mail.
Jail. Bail. Able. May-pole.
Phoebe  All good, thanks. (to Rachel) Do you maybe have a nickname have like a
nickname thats easier to rhyme?
Monica  Didnt your dad used to call you Pumpkin?
Rachel  Oh yeah!
Phoebe  Pumpkin? Yeah. But did he ever call you like, Budolph?
Chandler  (entering) Hello, children!
All  Hey!
Chandler  (to Rachel) Have I got the 50 guys for you!
Rachel  Really?!
Chandler  Oh yeah, I just showed this a picture of you and guys were throwing
themselves at me! Theyre buying me drinks! Theyre giving me stuff! (to Joey)
Knicks tonight?
Joey  Sure! Where are the seats?
Chandler  Wherever! Ive got like 20!
Rachel  So, will I like any of these guys?
Chandler  Yknow what, Im gonna uh, play the field just a little
more.
Rachel  Chandler!
Chandler  Guys are signing over their 401-Ks to me?
Phoebe  (shocked) You work with robots!!
Chandler  (pause) Yes. (to Rachel) Okay, theres this one guy, Patrick, I
think youre gonna like him, hes really nice, hes funny, hes a
swimmer.
Rachel  Ohh, I like swimmers bodies!
Chandler  Yes, and his father invented that magnetic strip on the back of credit
cards.
Rachel  Op, I like credit cards!
Chandler  See, Im not bad at this fixing up thing, huh?
Rachel  Well, so what does he do?
Chandler  Oh, he works in the Fine Foods division.
Rachel  Your company has a fine foods division?
Chandler  Its a big company, I dontif youI
Joey  Now, wait a second! You make food and robots?
Phoebe  No! No, the robots just work for them.
Monica  (getting up) All right, Im gonna go to work. Does anybody have a
problem with that?
Joey  Yeah, lady, I do! I got a problem with that!
Monica  You want a problem? Ill give you a problem!
Joey  Oh, what are you gonna do? Youre gonna fire me?
Monica  You bet your ass, Im gonna fire you! Thank you.
[Scene  Central Perk, Ross, Phoebe, and Chandler are there.]
Ross  Oh, wow! I should get going. I-I got a date tonight.
Chandler  Oh yeah! With who?
Ross  You know that girl I told you about who lives up in Poughkeepsie?
Chandler  Yeah.
Ross  Not her. Yeah, this is someone else I meet, and I-I cant decide
between the two of them. Yknow the one from Poughkeepsie, even though shes a
two hour train ride away, is really pretty, really smart, and-and a lot of fun. But this
other girl, well, she lives right uptown. Yknow shes, well
shes-shes just as pretty, I guess shes smart, shes not
fun.
Phoebe  If shes no fun, why do you want to date her at all?
Ross  Well, I-I want to give her another chance, yknow? She lives so
close. And, at the end of the date, the other time, she-she said something that
wasif she was kidding was very funny. On the other hand, if she wasnt kidding,
shes not fun, shes stupid, and kind of a racist.
Joey  (entering) Hey!
Ross  Hey!
Chandler  Hey, man!
Phoebe  Hey! Ooh, how was your first day working at the restaurant?
Joey  (checks his watch) Damn! (runs out to work)
[Scene  Allesandros, Monica is cooking.]
Joey  (entering from the dining room) Hey.
Monica  Hey.
Joey  Hey, what happened to your fancy chefs jacket? (sees theres a
burn spot on it)
Monica  They baked it. I cant take this anymore. Im gonna call a
meeting tonight, Im gonna fire you tonight.
Joey  You got it! Oh-oh! (He starts patting the burned spot, which just happens
to be over her breast.)
Monica  What are you doing?!
Joey  Its still a tiny bit on fire there.
Monica  Thanks. (Joeys still patting the burn spot) I think you got it!
[Scene  Central Perk, Chandler is there.]
Rachel  (entering) Chandler!! You have the best taste in men!
Chandler  Well, like father, like son.
Rachel  Patrick and I had such a great time last night! I mean I think this
could maybe turn into something serious.
Chandler  Really?! I-I thought you werent looking for something serious? I
thought you were looking for some kind of a fling.
Rachel  Well, y'know, possibly. (pause) You didnt tell him that, though?
Right?
Chandler  Ummmmmmmm, no.
Rachel  You told this guy that I was looking for a fling?! You dont tell
the guy that!
Chandler  Why not?! Id be thrilled if I heard that some hot girl was just
looking to getoh I see.
Rachel  Oh, between you telling him that I wanted to have a fling and me putting
out on the first dateoh, hes so gonna get the wrong idea.
[Scene  Allesandros, Joey is eating some cheese.]
Monica  Hey, Joey, could you pass the cheese?
Joey  Yeah. Listen uh, Id prefer it if you didnt call me Joey. Since
I dont know anyone here, I thought itd be cool to try out a cool work
nickname.
A Waiter  (entering) Hey, dragon! Heres your tips from Monday and Tuesday.
(hands him two envelopes)
Joey  (opening an envelope) Theres like-theres like 300 bucks in
this one!
The Waiter  Yeah, people get pretty generous around the holidays. And it never
hurts to wear tight trousers.
Monica  Okay. Could the waiters gather around to hear tonights specials?
Okay, first there is a Chilean Sea Bass prepared with a Mango relish on a bagWhy is
nobody writing these down?
The Waiter  Because we can remember them.
Monica  Because your all gonna make up fake specials and make me cook them like
you did the other night?
The Waiter  Well, sure, that too.
Monica  Okay, forget the specials for a minute. Umm, all right heres the
thing, for the last two weeks I have umm, (quietly) tried really hard to create a positive
atmosphere
The Waiter  Cant hear you!
Monica  (louder) A positive atmosphere! But I-I-I have had it up to here. (She
holds her hand over her head as an afterthought.) From now on, it is gonna be my
way, or the highway! All right? Does anybody have a problem with that?!! (Joey looks at
the money hes holding, and doesnt speak up.) Hey new guy! I said, does anybody
have a problem with that?!
Joey  No maam.
The Waiter  Hey! He has a name, its Dragon. Do you wanna know your name?
Check your hat. (to another waiter) We did the hat right? (The other waiter nods yes.)
[Scene  Allesandros, continued from earlier. The other waiters are gone and
Monica is confronting Joey about his not speaking up.]
Monica  What the hell happened?!
Joey  I am so-so-so sorry. I was gonna do it! Really! But I was standing there
with 327 dollars in one hand and 238 dollars in the other hand, and I was thinking,
"Wow! Its been a long time since I had (tries to do the math in his head,
but cant) 327 + 238 dollars!"
Monica  Joey, we had a deal. That-thats why youre here! Ive
got to fire you!
Joey  And I gotta pay rent! Look, how-how about this? You dont fire me,
instead I stay here, I gain their trust, and theyll start listening to all the nice
things Ive been saying about you.
Monica  What kinda things have you been saying?
Joey  Well nothing yet, they really hate you and I want to fit in.
[Scene  Central Perk, Phoebe is working on her holiday song, Chandler is sitting on the
couch reading a magazine, and Ross is sleeping on the couch.]
Phoebe  (singing) Happy, happy Chanukah, Chandler and Monica. Very merry
Chandler  (interrupting) Oh, yknow, yknow what Pheebs?
Phoebe  What?
Chandler  Im not Jewish, so
Phoebe  So! Ross doesnt really decorate his tree with
floss, but you dont hear him complaining do you? God! (Phoebe hits her guitar which
wakes up Ross with a start.)
Chandler  Bad dream?
Ross  I wasnt sleeping.
Chandler  Oh yeah, then uh, what was Phoebes song about?
Ross  The one with the cat. I gotta go, Ive got another date.
Phoebe  So, did you pick one yet?
Ross  No, it turns out that the one from uptown was making a joke. But it was a
different joke than I thoughtit wasnt that funny. So Im still torn.
Phoebe  Well look, you dont really like the one from uptown and
youre too exhausted from dating the one up in Poughkeepsie, so I say you just end
them both. Okay? You take a train up to Poughkeepsie and break up with her, and on your
way back you break up with uptown. And then by the time you get home tonight, youre
done!
Ross  Yknow, youre right. Thank you.
Phoebe  Umm, well I had a similar problem when I lived in Prague.
Chandler  Prague?
Phoebe  Theres sooo much you dont know.
[Scene  Chandler and Joey's, Chandler is playing living room golf as Rachel enters.
Rachel sees this and holds the door open until Chandler is ready to start his swing, when
he is, she slams the door shut which causes the club to fly from his hands. He turns
around, shocked.]
Rachel  Chandler! Patrick just uh, ended things with me. Did you or did you not
tell him that I was looking for a serious relationship?
Chandler  I did! I absolutely did!
Rachel  You idiot!!
Chandler  Im sure youre right, but why?
Rachel  You dont tell a guy that youre looking for a serious
relationship! You dont tell the guy that! Now you scared him away!
Chandler  Oh, man. Im sorry, Im so-so sorry.
Rachel  Yknow, you should never be allowed to talk to
people!
Chandler  I know! I know!
Rachel  Oh! See just Im right back where I started! Aww, this sucks! Being
alone, sucks! (She sits down heavily in one of the new chairs)
Chandler  Well, yknow, youre-youre gonna meet somebody!
Youre a great catch! Yknow when I was telling all those guys about you, I
didnt have to lie once. (He sits down on the arm of her chair)
Rachel  Really?
Chandler  Yeah! You graduated Magma Ku Laude, right?
Rachel  No.
Chandler  Oh, it doesnt matter. (Kisses her on the top of her head.) Hey,
yknow what, Ive got two tickets to tonights Rangers game, you wanna come
with me?
Rachel  Cute guys in little shorts? Sure.
Chandler  Well, actually its a hockey team, so its angry Canadians
with no teeth.
Rachel  Well that sounds fun too. (They hug.)
Chandler  Have you ever been with a woman?
Rachel  What?! Chandler, what is the matter with you?!
Chandler  So there is no good time to ask that question.
[Scene  A train to Poughkeepsie, Ross is asleep against the window.]
The Conductor  The next station is Poughkeepsie. Poughkeepsie!
The Woman From Poughkeepsie  (outside Rosss window) Ross? Ross!
(she knocks on the window) Wake up! Ross! (the train starts moving) Ross! Ross!! Ross!!!
Ross!!!!
[Scene  Allesandros, Monica is cooking.]
Monica  I need more swordfish. (to one of the assistant chefs) Can you get me
some more swordfish?
Kitchen Worker  I dont speak English.
Monica  You did a minute ago!
Kitchen Worker  Well, I dont know what to tell ya!
Monica  Fine!
Monica  Okay! Very funny! Somebody let me out please?! Come on, Im cold!
(She spills something.) And covered in marinara sauce! Come on! Let me out! (the door
opens)
The Waiter  You found that handle, did ya?
Monica  Thats not funny.
The Waiter  Well thats not true.
Monica  (starting to cry) Im a good person. And Im a good chef, and
I dont deserve to have marinara sauce all over me! Yknow what, if you want me
to quit this bad, then all you have to do is
Joey  (interrupting) Hey! Chef Geller! Yknow that little speech you made
the other day? Well I got a problem with it!
Monica  You do?
Joey  You bet I do! I just ah, wasnt listening then, thats all.
Monica  Well if you want a problem? Ill give you a problem!
Joey  What are you gonna do? Youre gonna fire me?
Monica  You bet your ass Im gonna fire you! Get out of my kitchen! Get
out!! (Joey leaves) All right! Anybody else got a problem? How bout you Chuckles?
You think this is funny now?
The Waiter  No.
Monica  How about if I dance around all covered in sauce? Huh?
You think its funny now?
The Waiter  No, its really good.
Monica  Good! Now, take those salads to table 4, (to the kitchen worker from
earlier) And you! Get the swordfish! (to another assistant chef) And you! Get a haircut!
[Scene  The train, its pulling into a station.]
The Conductor  Last stop, Montreal. This stop is Montreal.
Ross  (waking up) What? (notices that there is now a beautiful woman sitting
next to him)
Woman On Train  I made a bet with myself that you have beautiful eyes. Now that
I see them, I win.
Ross  What?
Woman On Train  Were at my stop. But would you like to have coffee?
Ross  (now fully awake) Are we really in Montreal?!
Woman On Train  Yes we are. So, coffee?
Ross  Coffee sounds great. (They get up) Wait, so, so you live in Montreal?
Woman On Train  Oh, no. But its just a two hour ferry ride to Nova Scotia.
[Scene  Allesandros, Joey is coming back in with his coat on.]
Joey  Well I guess I shouldve thought about my wife and kids before I
talked back to chef Geller!
Monica  Thanks.
Joey  Yep! Looks like its gonna be a leeeeean Christmas at the Dragon
house this year.
Monica  Enough!
Joey  (leaving) Lean-lean-lean!
[Scene  Central Perk, Phoebe is singing her holiday song.]
Phoebe  (singing) "Went to the store, sat on Santa's lap.
                               
Asked him to bring my friends all kind of crap.
                               
Said all you need is to write them a song.
                               
They haven't heard it, so don't try and sing along.
                               
No, don't sing along.
[Scene  Central Perk, Frank and Alice are there talking with Phoebe.]
Phoebe  Oh my God! I cant believe my little brother is married!
Frank  Oh I know!! (Both he and Alice squeal hysterically)
Phoebe  You guys, why didnt you tell me you were eloping?
Frank  Cause it just sorta happened, yknow we were at the
courthouse, we were having lunch
Phoebe  Wait, wait, why were you at the courthouse?
Frank  We were having lunch. Yeah and then all of the sudden we were like,
"Hey! Y'know, were here, having lunch lets get married!
Phoebe  Wow, a year and a half ago I didnt even know I had a brother, and
now I have a sister too. (They all hug, and Frank and Alice start kissing.) Okay. Okay.
Stop it, dont. So, I gotta get you a gift now. Is there anything you need?
Frank  Uhh, yeah.
Alice  Weve been trying to get pregnant, uh pretty much ever since we got
engaged, we thought wed get a jump on things, yknow no ones getting any
younger.
Frank  See the thing is umm, were not able to yknow, uh, conceive.
Alice  And weve tried everything, weve seen a bunch of doctors.
Frank  Yeah, and they-and they say that our-that our only chance to have a baby
is that if they take my sperm, her egg and put it together in a dish and then put it into
another girl. So we were wondering if you could be the girl that we could put it into.
Phoebe  (shocked) Thats a really nice gift. I was thinking of like a gravy
boat.
[Scene  Monica and Rachel's, Monica, Rachel, and Chandler are trying to throw cards
into a vase.]
Joey  (entering with Ross) Hey! You guys! Check it out, check it out! (Hes
wearing a blue blazer) Guess which job I got.
Chandler  I dont know, but Donald Trump wants his blue blazer black.
Ross  What?
Chandler  Blue blazer back. He-he wants it back.
Rachel  But you-you said black. Why would he want his blue blazer black?
Chandler  Well, you-you know what I meant.
Monica  No, you messed it up. Youre stupid.
Chandler  So what job did you get Joe?
Joey  Oh, ah, tour guide at the museum. Yeah, Ross got it for me.
Rachel  Well, how can you be a tour guide, dont you have to be a dinosaur
expert or something?
Joey  No, not really. They give you all the information, its uh, its
like memorizing a script. (Making like a tour guide) "And on your left, you have
Tyrannosaurus Rex, a carnivore from the Jurassic period.
Chandler, Monica, and Rachel   Great!! Thats great!
Ross  Uh actually Joey, its the Cretasous period.
Joey  Yeah but, I can pronounce Jurassic.
Phoebe  (entering) Hey!!
All  Hey!
Phoebe  Guess what. Frank Jr., and Alice got married!
All  Oh my God!!
Phoebe  And! And, theyre gonna have a baby! (The gang is shocked.) And!
And, they want me to grow it for them in my uterus. (The gang is stunned into silence.)
Ross  My God!
Monica  Are you serious?
Phoebe  Yeah
Joey  Youre really thinking about having sex with your brother?!
Phoebe  Ewww! And "Oh no!" Itsthey just want me to be the
surrogate. Its her-its her egg and her sperm, and Im-Im just the
oven, its totally their bun.
Joey  Huh.
Monica  What did you tell them?
Phoebe  Well, they said that I had to think about it first, but what is there to
think about? Im gonna be giving them the greatest gift you can possibly give.
Chandler  Youre gonna be carrying their baby and give them a Sony Play
Station?
Rachel  Honey, this really is an incredible thing to do for them, but there are
things to think about.
Monica  Yeah, like youre gonna be pregnant. I mean pregnant.
Phoebe  I know!
Ross  Pheebs, youre talking about putting your body through an awful lot,
I mean morning sickness, uhh, labour, and its all for somebody else!
Phoebe  Yeah, whats your point?
Ross  Well, the stuff I just mentioned.
Rachel  Wow! I dont know if I could ever do that. I always figured the
first time I had a baby was with somebody I love and that baby would be akeeper.
Phoebe  Y'know you guys were a lot more supportive when I wanted to make denim
furniture.
Joey  No, Pheebs, listen, if you decide to do this, well be supportive
like crazy.
All  Yeah.
Monica  We just want you to think it through.
Rachel  Yeah, honey, maybe you can talk to somebody whos had a baby. Like
your mom?
Phoebe  My mom never gave birth. Oh! But my birth mom did.
[Scene  Central Perk, Chandler and Kathy are kissing.]
Kathy  Umm, (moves her hands down to his butt) I love this touchy. Can I
take it to work with me?
Chandler  Oh, yeah, sure, its not mine anyway. It can with the pants.
Kathy  Oh! (They kiss and she leaves)
Monica  I am so jealous.
Rachel  You guys are really rightthere arent you?
Chandler  Yes. Right where?
Monica  In the beginning where yknow its all sex and talking and sex
and talking and
Chandler  Yeah, you-you gotta love the talking.
Monica  And the sex?
Chandler  All right, we havent had sex yet. Okay, whats the big
deal? Yknow? This is special, and I want our love to grow until we move on to the
next level.
Rachel  Oh, Chandler that is so nice.
Ross  That is really nicelying! No way is that the reason!
Rachel  Why? Just because youre not mature enough to understand something
like that?!
Chandler  No, hes right, Im totally lying.
Monica  Then what is it?
Chandler  Well, Kathys last boyfriend was Joey.
Ross  And youre afraid you wont be able tofill his shoes.
Chandler  No, Im afraid I wont be able to make love as well as him.
Ross  Yeah, I was going for the metaphor.
Chandler  Yes, and I was saying the actual words.
Monica  So big deal, so Joeys had a lot of girlfriends, it doesnt
mean hes great in bed.
Chandler  We share a wall! So either hes great in bed, or she just likes
to agree with him a lot.
Monica  Sweetie, with you its gonna be different. The sex is gonna be
great, cause you-you guys are in love.
Chandler  Yeah?
Rachel  Yeah!
Ross  Just go for it Chandler.
Monica  Yeah, you should.
Rachel  Yeah, you should, really.
Monica  Go on.
Chandler  All right, all right, Ill go sleep with my girlfriend. But
Im just doing it for you guys.
[Scene  The museum, Joey is giving a tour to a bunch of school kids.]
Joey  Okay, now the Mastodon is from the semi-late Jurassic period.
Smart Kid  Isnt the Mastodon from the Pliocene Epic?
Joey  Shhh! This is a museum, no talking. Right down here, (Motions to a
fossilised dinosaur foot.) we have a large foot. (Sees Ross working in one of the display
cases.) Uhh, and over here we have Ross Geller. (Knocks on the glass) Everyone wave
Hi to Ross. Ross is one of our most important scientists, look at him, hard at
work. (Ross does the old "Putting a cigarette in your ear and pulling it out of your
mouth trick.") Okay, moving right along. Come on.
[Scene  Phoebe Sr.s house, theres a knock on the door.]
Phoebe Sr  Its open! Come in!
Phoebe  Hi!
Phoebe Sr  Hi!
Phoebe  Im sorry, Im late.
Phoebe Sr  Oh, thats okay, it gave me time to finish glazing my nipples.
Phoebe  Wow! You really go all out when youre expecting company.
Phoebe Sr  No, I was working on my pottery.
Phoebe  Oh! Ooh! Oh, I didnt know that you didpot.
Phoebe Sr  Well, yeah, mostly nudes. It combines my two passions, pottery and
erotica.
Phoebe  Ooh, erotiery!
Phoebe Sr  Hey! Okay! Well thanks for coming out to see me. I just-I just
thought it would be a very good idea to talk about this baby stuff in person.
Yknow
Phoebe  Okay.
Phoebe Sr  I really dont think its a very good idea, Phoebe.
Phoebe  Why not?
Phoebe Sr  Well, because youd be giving up a baby, and I-I really
dontI dont know if theres anything I can say that could make you
understand the pain of giving up a baby. So, umm, (Picks up a puppy in the box next to the
couch.)
Phoebe  Oh no! No-no! I understand the pain! Dont-dont hurt the
puppy.
Phoebe Sr  No-no-no, the-the puppys yours.
Phoebe  Oh, I get a puppy!!
Phoebe Sr  Well, yeah! I mean yeah, but only for three days.
Phoebe  Why?
Phoebe Sr  I realise I dont have any right to start get all parenty on you
and everything now, but umm, (Sees that Phoebe isnt paying attention and is busy
mimicking the puppy.) uhh Phoebe, would you please look at me and not the puppy,
its very important.
Phoebe  Okay.
Phoebe Sr  I mean, I know what Im talking about. I gave up two babies, and
I only wish I had someone there that had given up babies, that could tell me how terrible
it is to give up babies. I just think that, it would be something you will regret every
single day for the rest of your life. So, how ever hard it is to give up this puppy, it
would be like a million times harder to give up a child. (Phoebe is playing with the puppy
again, and not listening) I really shouldnt have given you the puppy first.
Phoebe  All right, Im sorry.
[Scene  The museums worker cafeteria, Joey is eating lunch with the rest of the
tour guides. Another tour guide tries to sit down in a seat Joey saved for Ross.]
Joey  Uhh, do you mind sitting there. Im-Im saving this for my
friend Ross.
Tour Guide  You mean Dr. Geller?
Joey  Doctor? Wow! I didnt know he had a nickname.
Tour Guide  Oh, he wont sit here. Only the people in the white coats sit
over there, (Points to there table) and only the people in the blue blazers sit here.
Joey  Well, how-how come?
Tour Guide  Thats just the way it is.
Joey  Thats crazy.
Tour Guide  Maybe its crazy in a perfect world, a world without lab coats
and blazers, but you not in a perfect world, you in a museum now. See that scientist in
the classes, he and I used to play together all the time in grade school, but
now(Turns around) Peter! Hey, Peter! Its me Rhonda! From PS-129! I shared my
puddin which you man! I gave you my Snack Pack! (to Joey) See, he pretend
he dont even here me!
Joey  I-I think everybodys pretending they dont hear you. Anyway,
look, I dont know about you and your jackets and your separate tables, but Ross is
one of my best friends, and if I save him a seat, Im telling you, he will sit
in it! (Ross enters and goes over to the white table) Ross! Ross! Over here, man! I-I
saved you seat.
Ross  Thats okay, Im cool over here. Ill catch up with you
later, Joey. (Joey is shocked.)
Tour Guide  Op, this is saved. (Joey wonders why) Gift shop.
[Scene  Monica and Rachel's, Joey is eating dinner, Monica and Rachel are sitting on
the couch.]
Ross  (entering) Hey, uh, Im really, really sorry about what happened in
the cafeteria today.
Joey  Its no big deal. Hey, yknow, you do what you gotta do. Right?
Ross  But hey, its not just me, I mean the scientists and the tour guides never
sit together.
Joey  Whatever.
Ross  Its like that everywhere, Joey! Okay, Mon, back me up here. Where
you work the uh, waiters eat with the waiters, right? And the chefs eat with the other
chefs, right?
Monica  I eat by myself in the alley because everybody hates me.
Joey  Look, Ross, really its-its no big deal. Yknow you wear a
white coat, I wear a blue blazer, if that means we cant be friends at work, then so
be it. Yknow, hey I understand. Yknow? Hey, when Im in a play and
youre in the audience, I dont talk to you, right? So its yknow,
its uh, its cool. Ill see you tomorrow. (Leaves)
Rachel  Yeah, when were in the audience he doesnt talk to us, but he
does wave.
[Scene  Monica and Rachel's, the next morning, Phoebe is there with her puppy and is
trying to sing it to sleep as Chandler enters.]
Chandler  Hi.
Monica  Hey!
Chandler  Why is Phoebe singing to Carl Mulden?
Phoebe  Ooh, yknow what, I think its time for puppy to go out again.
Come on, lets go to the balcony.
Monica  What?!
Phoebe  Umm, the street. Come on, lets go to the street. Ooh, listen,
dont go onto the balcony until after I get back. (Leaves)
Monica  (to Chandler) So, did you do it?
Chandler  Yes, yes, we had the sex.
Monica  Uh-oh, it was bad?
Chandler  It was fine, yknow? But she didnt agree with me as
strongly as she agreed with Joey. She was more like, "I see you point, Im all
right with it."
Monica  Well, it was the first time. Yknow, theres not always a lot
of agreement the first time.
Rachel  Yeah, not girls anyway, guys agree (snaps her fingers) like that.
Chandler  Look, you have to help me! Okay? I mean, I know what to do with a
woman, yknow, I know where everything goes, its always nice. But I need to
know what makes it go from nice to, "My God! Somebodys killing her in
there!"
Monica  All right, Im gonna show you something a lot of guys dont
know. Rach, give me that pad, please? (She does so and Monica starts drawing on it) All
right. Now
Chandler  Look, you dont have to draw an actual wowhoa! Shes
hot!
Monica  Now everybody knows the basic erogenous zones. (She starts labelling
them) You got one, two three, four (Chandler is shocked to find out theres more than
three), five, six, and seven!
Chandler  (shocked) There are seven?!
Rachel  Let me see that. (Monica shows her) Oh, yeah.
Chandler  (Points to one) Thats one?
Monica  Its kind of an important one!
Chandler  Oh, yknow-yknow what, I was looking at it upside down.
Rachel  Well, yknow, sometimes that helps. (She realises what that
couldve meant.)
Monica  (continuing) Now, most guys will hit uh, 1-2-3 and then go to 7 and set
up camp.
Chandler  That-thats bad?
Rachel  Well if you go to Disneyland, you dont spend the whole
day on the Materhorn.
Chandler  Well you might if it were anything like 7!
Monica  All right uh, the important thing is to take your time, you want to hit
em all, and you mix em up. You gotta keep them on their toes.
Rachel  Oo, toes!! Well, for some people. (Chandler eyes her and her toes.)
Monica  All right. Umm, you could uh start out with a little 1, a 2, a 1-2-3, 3,
5, a 4, a 3-2, 2, a 2-4-6, 2-4-6, 4, (Rachel starts getting worked up) 2, 2, 4-7, 5-7,
6-7, 7, 7..77-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7(mouths 7)! (They both lean
back on the couch satisfied.)
[Scene  The museum cafeteria, Joey is eating with the tour guides as Ross enters.]
Older Scientist  Dr. Geller, theres a seat over here. (Motions to
an empty chair at the white table.)
Ross  Thank you, Dr. Phillips, but Im having my lunch at this table, here
in the middle. Im having lunch right here, with my good friend Joey, if hell
sit with me.
Joey  (standing up) I will sit with you Dr. Geller. (He goes over to his table
and they shake hands.)
Ross  Y'know, we work in a museum of natural history, and yet there is something
unnatural about the way we eat lunch. Now, I look around this cafeteria, and yknow
what I see, I see-I see division. Division, between people in white coats and people in
blue blazers, and I ask myself, "My God why?!" Now, I say we shed these-these
coats that separate us, and we get to know the people underneath. (He takes off his coat
and throws it down.) Im Ross! Im divorced, and I have a kid!
Joey  (stands up, and throws his coat on the floor) Im Joey! Im an
actor! I dont know squat about dinosaurs!
Another Tour Guide  (standing up and removing his coat) Im Ted, and I just
moved here a month ago, and New York really scares me.
Ross  All right, there you go!
Joey  Yeah, you hang in there Teddy!
Older Scientist  Im Andrew, and I didnt pay for this pear.
Ross  Okay, good-good for you.
Tour Guide  Im Rhonda, (motions to her breasts) and these arent
real! (Joey and Ross look at each other, shocked)
Ross  Wow, Rhonda.
Another Scientist  Im Scott.
Ross  Yeah, okay, Scott!
Another Scientist  And I need to flip the light switch on and off 17 times
before I leave a room or my family will die.
[Scene  Central Perk, Phoebe, with the puppy, Monica, and Rachel are sitting on the
couch.]
Phoebe  My moms gonna be here any minute. I cant do this, I
cant give him up. Yesno, I can. I dont want to. But I can. No.
Rachel  Oo, I cant watch this, its like Sophies Choice.
Monica  Yknow, I never saw that.
Rachel  Ooh, it was only okay.
Phoebe  Ooh, I cant do this. My mom was right. If I cant-if I
cant give him up, then theres no way I can give up a baby. Ohh, God, Frank and
Alice are gonna be so crushed. What-what else, what else can I give ema
kidney!
Alice  (entering with Frank) Hi!
Frank  Hi!
Alice  Uhh, we were just in the neighbourhood, so
Frank  Yeah, so we just thought wed stop by and let you know theres
still no pressure.
Alice  None. But if there was something you wanted to tell us, were just
gonna be right over there (points to the counter) having coffee.
Phoebe  Okay.
Frank  (noticing the puppy) Oh, whos this little guy?! (Grabs the puppy)
Phoebe  Oh! Ooh! Umm!
Frank  Oh, hes so cute, he reminds me of my old dog, Tumour.
Alice  You are so precious, I could just take you home.
Phoebe  Hey, why dont you?
Frank  Are you serious?
Phoebe  Uh-huh, yeah!
Frank  Oh, thanks.
Monica  What are you doing?
Phoebe  No, Im really okay with this. Yknow why? Cause look at
them, and I made that, so I know its gonna be like a million times harder to
give up a baby but, oh my God, its gonna feel like a million times better, right? I
wanna do this. (To Frank and Alice) I wanna carry your baby.
Alice  (shocked) Oh! Oh! Oh! Thank you so much! You dont know what this
means to us! Oh!
Frank  Oh my God, I think Im gonna cry!
Monica  Its gonna be so great.
Phoebe Sr  (entering) Hi! Whats going on?
Phoebe  Oh, I-I gave them the puppy and it made them so happy that I decided
Im gonna carry their baby.
Phoebe Sr  But Phoebe
Phoebe  No-no-no, I know, but you and I are different people though, and this is
a totally different situation, and I know that I am not gonna regret this.
Phoebe Sr  Oh, I-I-I understand all that, but its justthat was my
puppy.
Phoebe  Oh!
[Scene  Monica and Rachel's, Monica and Rachel are sitting at the table.]
Monica  Would you ever be a surrogate for anyone?
Rachel  It depends on who asked.
Monica  What if I asked?
Rachel  Oh, Mon, sure.
Monica  Really?
Rachel  Yes. (Pause) Youre not asking are you?
Monica  No.
Rachel  Yes! Totally!
Kathy  Oh! Thank you! Thank you! Thank you! Yes! Thank you! (Runs back to
Chandler)
Rachel  What the hell is that?!! (to Monica) What the hell is that? Is
that you? (Monica nods her head no, and Rachel realizes what is making that sound.)
Ohhhhhhh! (storms over to Chandler and Joeys with Monica in trail.)
Monica  Boy, you are really not a morning person.
Rachel  (angrily) BACK OFF!!! (She starts banging on their door.) Get up! Get
up! Get up! God damn it! Get up, get up, get up, get up, get up!!
Rachel  What is that noise?
Chandler  You!
Joey  Its the chick! Shesgoing through some changes.
Monica  What kind of changes?
Chandler  Well the vet seems to think thats shes becoming a rooster.
(The rooster crows.) Were getting a second opinion.
[Scene  Monica and Rachel's, its later that morning, everybody has gotten up and
Ross and Phoebe has joined them for breakfast. Rachel is returning from shopping.]
Phoebe  Hey!
Ross  Hey, what are you doing shopping at eight in the morning?
Rachel  Well, Ive been up since six. Thanks to somebodys
dumb-ass rooster.
Phoebe  You guys you really should get rid of those animals. They shouldnt
be living in an apartment.
Rachel  Yeah! Especially not with all of these knives and cookbooks around
Phoebe  All right. Im gonna go to the fertility doctor and um, see if
Im ready to have Frank and Alices embryo transferred into my uterus.
Ross  Now, how will they know if youre ready?
Phoebe  Oh, theyre just gonna umm, look to see if my endometria layer is
thick.
Chandler  Oh, I can uh, check that for ya.
Phoebe  Okay everyone, think thick.
All  Good-bye! Good luck! (She opens the door to reveal Monica and Joey.)
Phoebe  Hi! Wish me luck!
Monica  Oh, good luck.
Joey  Good luck. (to Monica) And Im still right!
Monica  That is sooo not true!
Rachel  What?
Joey  Shes mad because I know todays her laundry day and that means
shes wearing her old lady underpants.
Chandler  I can check that for ya.
Monica  I justI cant believe that you think that you and Chandler
know me and Rachel better than we know you.
Chandler  Well we-we do. You can only eat Tic Tacks in even
numbers.
Joey  Yeah, whats that about?
Chandler  (to Rachel) And you Ross, I believe, if you check Rachels
bag you will find a half-eaten box of cookies in there.
Ross  (He does so, and finds a half-eaten box of cookies.) Youre good.
(Tries a cookie.) These are not.
Rachel  Im so not impressed. Everybody snacks when they shop.
Monica  Yeah.
Joey  Oh yeah? Ross, how many items left in that bag?
Ross  Five.
Chandler  Okay, ten bucks says that we can name every item in that bag.
Rachel  How many guesses do you get?
Joey  Six.
Ross  Challenge extended.
Monica  Deal!
Ross  Challenge excepted.
Joey  All right, well start withapples.
Ross  Well be starting with apples.
Chandler  (to Ross) Stop that now!
Chandler  Yes!
Joey  Okay. Uhh, tortilla chips, yogurt.
Chandler  Diet soda.
Ross  Yes. Yes. Yes. (Theyre perfect so far.)
Chandler  Orange juice.
Rachel  No! Theres no orange juice in there! We win!!
Monica  Ha-ha!
Ross  They have another guess.
Rachel  Okay, well, we won that one.
Joey  Okay, the last thing
Chandler  Oh-oh, oh, oh-oh! (Whispers something in Joeys ear.)
Joey  No-no, not for like another two weeks.
Chandler  I got it! Scotch tape. (Theyre right.)
Ross  How did you know she would buy scotch tape?
Chandler  Well, we used theres up last night making scary faces.
Monica  Aww, man!
Chandler  All right! Ten buck! Fork it over! Cough it up! Pay the piper! Gimme
it.
Monica  That does not mean you know us better, I-I want a rematch.
Rachel  Yeah, and none of these stupid grocery questions, real personal
questions.
Monica  Yeah! And the winner gets a hundred bucks.
Joey  Serious?
Monica  Are you scared?
Joey  No! All right, who-who makes up the questions?
Monica  Ross will do it.
Ross  Oh sure, "Ross will do it!" Its not like he has a job, or
a child, or a life of his own.
Rachel  Fine! Well ask Phoebe.
Ross  No-no-no, I-I wanna play.
[Scene  The Doctors office, Dr. Zane is examining Phoebe as Frank and Alice
watch.]
Dr. Zane  It looks like your uterus is ready for implantation.
Phoebe  Oh! I knew it! I knew it! I felt really thick this morning.
Frank  Well, okay, so whats nowgo get, go get the eggs, put em
in there.
Dr. Zane  Okay, itll take just a little while to prepare the embryos.
Phoebe  Embryossss? As in, "More than one?"
Dr. Zane  Um-hmm, five actually.
Phoebe  Five? Okay, where am I giving birth, a hospital or a big box under the
stairs?
Dr. Zane  We do five because that gives you a 25% chance that at least one will
attach.
Phoebe  Thats it! 25 percent? That means thats its like 75
percent chance of no baby at all!
Frank  Hey, yknow I was thinking, what are the odds like if-if, if you
stuff like 200 of them in there?
Alice  Sweety, now, shes a woman, not a gumball machine.
Phoebe  Okay, well yknow what, dont worry you guys, cause
Im-Im gonna do this as many times as it takes to get it right.
Frank  Well, you see, the-the thing is, we-we only got, we kinda have one shot
to make it right.
Alice  Umm, it costs $16,000 each time you do this. So, umm, were kinda
using all the money we have to do it just this one time.
Phoebe  Whoa!! Thatokay, thats a lot of pressure on me and my
uterus. (to Dr. Zane) So, well okay, so is thereis maybe is there something that I
can do yknow just to like help make sure I get pregnant?
Dr. Zane  No, Im sorry.
Phoebe  Wow! You guys really dont know anything!
Frank  I know! Why dont you get drunk! That worked for a lot of girls in
my high school.
[Scene  Monica and Rachel's, the game is about to begin.]
Monica  You guys! Do you realize that any minute now, Phoebe can be pregnant?
Joey  Huh.
Rachel  I know! I know, its such a huge, life-altering thing.
Joey  I know.
Ross  The test is ready.
All  Yeah! Yes! (They all right into the living room, all excited.)
Ross  Okay, each team will answer ten questions. The first team that answers the
most questions wins. Okay, the categories are, Fears and Pet Peeves, Ancient History,
Literature, and Its All Relative. Now, the coin toss to see who goes first. (He
flips the coin and they all watch it hit the table and stop. Then they all look up at him,
to see who goes first.) Okay, somebody call it this time.
All  Oh yeah!
Rachel  Tails!
Ross  Its heads. (The guys celebrate.) Gentlemen, pick your category.

Ross  Althea is correct.
Chandler  Nice shooting!
Rachel  Well take Literature!!
Ross  Every week, the TV Guide comes to Chandler and Joeys apartment. What
name appears on the address label?
Rachel  Chandler gets it! Its Chandler Bing!
Monica  No!!
Ross  Im afraid the TV Guide comes to Chinandolor Bong.
Monica  I knew that! Rachel! Use youre head!
Chandler  Actually, its Miss Chinandolor Bong.
[Scene  The Doctors office, Phoebe is giving a pep talk to the petrie dish
containing the embryos.]
Phoebe  Hello, tiny embryos. Well, Im-Im Phoebe Buffay, hi!
Im-Im-Im hoping to be your uterus for the next nine months. You should
know, that were doing this for Frank and Alice, who you know, youve been

Dr. Zane  Ready?
Phoebe  Uh-huh. (To the embryos) Good luck.
[Scene  Monica and Rachel's, the game is coming to a close.]
Ross  All right, the score is nine to eight in favor of the guys. Ladies if you
miss this the game is theirs, pick your category.
Rachel  (shouting) Its All Relative!!

Rachel  (shouting) Im sorry!
Ross  Ooh. What is the name of Chandlers fathers Las Vegas all-male
burlesque?

Chandler  Unfortunately that is correct.
The Girls  Yes!!
Ross  All right, we have a tie. Luckily, I have prepared for such an event. (He
opens up an envelope and holds up some note cards.) The Lightning Round!
All  Ohhhh.
Ross  Thirty seconds, all the questions you can answer.
Monica  You guys are dead, I am so good at lighting rounds.
Chandler  I majored in lightning rounds. All right, were gonna destroy
you.
Monica  Huh, wanna bet?
Chandler  Well, Im so confused as to what weve been doing so
far
Monica  How about we play for more money, say 150?
Ross  150 dollars.
Chandler  Say 200?
Ross  200 dollars.
Monica  Youre doing it again.
Ross  Excuse me.
Rachel  Monica, I dont want to lose 200 dollars.
Monica  We wont. (to Chandler) 300?
Rachel  Monica?!
Monica  Im just trying to spice it up!
Rachel  Okay, so lets play for some pepper! Stop spending my money!
Monica  I got it! How about, if we win, they have to get rid of the rooster?
Rachel  Oooohh thats interesting.
Joey  Hey, no way, that roosters family!
Rachel  Throw in the duck too!
Joey  What do you have against the duck?! He doesnt make any noise!
Rachel  Well, he gets the other one all riled up.
Joey  Look, we are not gonna
Chandler  (interrupting) All right, hold on! If you win, we give up the birds.
Joey  (shocked) Dah!! (Chandler motions for him to calm down.)
Chandler  But if we win, we get your apartment.
Joey  Oooooh!
Monica  Deal!
[Scene  Monica and Rachel's, continued from earlier, only slightly later.]
Rachel  Monica, betting the apartment, I dont know about this.
Monica  Rachel, I have not missed one question the whole game. I own this game!
Look at my hand. (Holds up her hand.)
Rachel  Why? Do you have the answers written on there?
Monica  No! Steady as a rock! Now, are you with me.
Rachel  All right, lets do it.
Monica  Come on!
Rachel  Okay. (They go into the living room.)
Ross  All right, gentlemen, youre up first.
Joey  Okay.
Chandler  Okay. (Starts jumping around.)
Ross  You have 30 seconds. And the lightning round beginsstop it (Chandler
stops jumping)now. What was Monicas nickname when she was a field hockey

Monica  And processing.
Rachel  He carries a briefcase.
Ross  10 seconds, you need this or you lose the game.
Monica  Its umm, it has something to do with transponding.
Rachel  Oh-oh-oh, hes a transponcetranspondster!
Monica  Thats not even a word! I can get this! I can get this!
Monica  NOOOOOOOOO!!!!!
Rachel  Oh my God.
Chandler and Joey  YEAH!!! YES!!!
[Scene  Monica and Rachel's, erm, Chandler and Joey's, Chandler and Joey are carrying
in the foosball table.]
Joey  I call Monicas room!
Chandler  You cant just call Monicas room.
Joey  Sure I can, standard shotgun rules, Im sight of the room and I
called it.
Monica  Man, I feel like Im coming down with something.
Joey  What?
Monica  Yeah. (to Chandler) I bet you cant guess what color my tonsils
are? Ill bet the apartment!
Chandler  Oh, I would never bet this apartment. Its too nice.
Phoebe  (entering) Hey!
Chandler  Hey!
Joey  Heyooh Pheebs, are they in there?
Phoebe  Umm, yeah, uh-huh, theyre implanted.
Monica  How do you feel?
Phoebe  Well, freaked. Cause it turns out that the odds are really sucky.
And! This is Frank and Alices like only shot. Like, they are literally
putting all of their eggs in my basket.
Chandler  Yeah, but I bet it works.
Monica  Really?! How much?!
Phoebe  All right, Im gonna go take a pregnancy test, right now.
Joey  Oh wow! You can tell this soon.
Phoebe  Well the doctor says it takes a couple days, but my bodys always
been a little faster than Western medicine.
Rachel  (entering from Chandlers bedroom, I guess, and sees the foosball
table.) Oh my God! I cant believe you guys are actually think youre moving in
here!
Chandler  Well believe it baby!
Rachel  Well I-I-Im not moving.
Joey  What?!
Rachel  No, it was a stupid bet! We were just playing a game!
Joey  You cant just ignore the bet! Its a bet! You bet and you bet
and if you lose, you lose the bet!
Monica  Look Rach, we have to move. I mean if they had lost, we wouldve
made them get rid of the birds. Right?
Rachel  Noooo.
Monica  All right, look, I hate this as much as you, but if it makes you feel
better, its all your fault.
Rachel  What?!
Monica  Chinadolor Bong, come on, we steal that TV Guide every week!
Chandler  I knew it!
Rachel  I dont care, Im not going anywhere.
Chandler  Cool, girl roommate.
Monica  Well?
Phoebe  Nope, not knocked up yet.
Monica  Its only been a couple of hours, so just give it some time.
Phoebe  Yeah, all right. Meanwhile, Im gonna do whatever I can to help
this so, Im just gonna yknow, lie it your chair, (She climbs into the chair
and drapes her feet over the back of the chair.) Y'know? Yeah, good, Im let gravity
yknow, do its jobs.
Monica  Hey, Rach, can you give me a hand with this box?
Rachel  No! Put that box down! We are not going anywhere! This is my apartment
and I like it! This is a girls apartment! That is a boys apartment, its
dirty and it smells. This is pretty. Its-its so pretty! And look, and
its-its purple! And Im telling you, you with the steady hand, I am not
moving, and now I have got the steady hand. (She holds out her hand, which is
shaking uncontrollably.)
Monica  Ill take care of it.
Rachel  Thats right! You do what the hand says!
Rachel  How did it go?
Monica  I lost our mattresses.
Phoebe  (singing) "Are you in there little fetus? 
                            
In nine will you come great us? 
                            
I will buy you some Adidas."
Monica  Hey!
Frank and Alice  (entering) Hi!
Alice  Hi, Phoebe! We were just at the drugstore and we got you a little
present.
Phoebe  Oh. Oh.
Frank  Umm, its a lollipop and a uh, a home pregnancy test.
Monica  Hey, dont mix those up, you could really ruin that lollipop.
Alice  So umm, you feel like taking a test? Theres only one question.
Phoebe  All right, I will. No, I will. But umm, yknow just remember that
its still really early, okay so, if it says that Im not pregnant, that
doesnt mean that Im not gonna get pregnant, okay and, and just please,
just so I dont go completely nuts, just try not put all your hopes on this.
Alice  Okay.
Frank  Okay. (They both squeal in expectation.)
Phoebe  Great. (Goes to take the test.)
Rachel  Yknow what, you are mean boys, who are just being mean!
Joey  Hey, dont get mad at us! No one forced you to raise the stakes!
Rachel  That is not true. She did! She forced me!
Monica  Hey, we would still be living here if hadnt gotten the question
wrong!
Rachel  Well it stupid, unfair question!
Ross  Dont blame the questions!
Chandler  Would you all stop yelling in our apartment! You are ruining moving
day for us!
Rachel  Will you stop calling it your apartment!
Joey  But it is our apartment!
Rachel  No its not!
Phoebe  You guys! You guys! Youre gonna have a baby! Theyre gonna
have a baby!
Frank  MY SISTERS GONNA HAVE MY BABY!!!!!!!
Phoebe  Okay, but this cant be good for the baby.
All  Oh! (They stop hugging her to let her out and resume the hug without her.)
[Scene  Chandler and Joey's, erm, Monica and Rachel's, Monica and Rachel are busy
unpacking.]
Monica  I cant find garbage bags!
Rachel  Oh, I think I saw some in here.
Monica  What is it?!
Rachel  I dont know! But maybe if we keep that drawer shut, itll
die.
Monica  I cant believe were living here!
[Scene  Monica and Rachel's, erm, Chandler and Joey's, theyre both unpacked. The
big ceramic dog has found a new home in front of the window. Joey screams and runs into
the living room.]
Chandler  What?! What-what is it?!
Joey  Did you see the size of the closets?!
Chandler  I cant believe we live here!
Chandler and Joey  Awwwww!! (They lean back all the way.) Awwwwwww!!!
[Scene  A Theatre, Chandler and Ross are there to watch the premiere of Kathys
play.]
Chandler  Okay, she is the star of the play. And she is my girlfriend! I
get to have sex with the star of the play!
Ross  People can hear you.
Chandler  I know!!
Chandler  Wow! She looks great. Doesnt she?
Ross  Yeah.
Kathy's Co-Star  Hi!
Kathy  Hi!
Ross  That is one good looking man!
Chandler  Is it just me, or can you actually see his abs through his overcoat?!
Kathy's Co-Star  Sooo, youve been doing this long?
Kathy  No, youre my first. Put the money on the table.
Kathy's Co-Star  Oh, yeah! Ooh, thats nice. (They start making out
harder.)
Ross  Dude!
Kathy's Co-Star  Is that an expensive blouse?
Kathy  If you want it to be.
Ross  Heres your girlfriends button. (Holding the button.)
[Scene  Chandler and Joey's, erm, Monica and Rachel's, Monica is still unpacking after
the move, and Phoebe is their also.]
Phoebe  Oh, hey, Mon, do you still have your like old blouses and dresses from
high school?
Monica  Yeah, I think I have some around here somewhere. Why?
Phoebe  Well, its just that maternity clothes are so expensive.
Monica  Hey, Rach! I made a pile of your stuff over on this side of the room. If
you could just(Rachel grunts and throws her purse at it)throw your purses at
it.
Rachel  Bloomingdales eliminated my department. (Phoebe gasps)
Monica  Oh my God, are you out of a job?
Rachel  No, but they stuck me in personal shopping. Which is just a huge
step down!
Phoebe  Personal shopping? What is that? Like where you walk around with snooty
rich people and tell them what to buy?
Rachel  Uh-huh.
Phoebe  That sounds great!
Joey  (entering) Hey! (Goes to the fridge.)
Monica  Umm, excuse me, we switched apartments. You cant eat are food
anymore, that-that gravy train had ended.
Joey  (Holding a turkey leg) Theres gravy?
Monica  If you have the big apartment you have to deal with people coming over
all the time. That fridge has got to be stocked, okay, thats your department now.
(She takes back the turkey leg)
Monica  What are you doing?
Joey  I think I left a donut up here.
[Scene  Central Perk, Ross and Chandler are entering after the play. Phoebe and Joey
are already there.]
Ross  Hey!
Phoebe  Hey!
Joey  Hey!
Phoebe  Ooh! How was Kathys play?
Ross  Well, Kathy gets half-naked and simulates sex with a real good
lookin guy.
Chandler  Yeah, its like someone literally wrote down my worst
nightmare and then charged me $32 to see it!
Phoebe  Thats a good idea for a business!
Chandler  Im totally screwed. Okay, they are gonna be hot and heavy on
stage every night, and then theyre gonna go to their cast parties and hes
gonna try to undermine me. Y'know itll be like, "So wheres your
boyfriend, whats-his-name, Chester?" And shell go, "No-no-no,
its Chandler." And hell go, "Whatever. Ha-ha-ha-ha!"
Joey  (to Ross) That-that is a good trick.
Chandler  All right, look, look, what am I gonna do?
Joey  Chandler, look theyre actors. Theyre there to do a job, just
cause they work together, doesnt mean theyre gonna get together. I mean
just cause it happened with Susan Sarandon and Tim Robbins, it doesnt mean
its gonna happen with them.
Ross  Oh-oh, Alec Baldwin and Kim Basinger.
Joey  Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman.
Ross  Yeah.
Phoebe  Hey, Mel Gibson and Clint Eastwood.
Ross  Theyre not a couple!
Phoebe  Oh-okay, I get the game now.
Joey  Okay look, look, let me ask you a question, when they were doing it on
stage, was it like really hot?
Ross  Oh yeah!
Joey  Well okay, so then youre fine. The rule is when two actors are
actually doing it off-stage all the sexual tension between them is gone. Okay? So as long
as its hot onstage you got nothing to worry about. Its when the heat goes
away, thats when youre in trouble.
Chandler  Really?
Joey  Look, you guys have been to every play Ive ever been in, have I ever
had chemistry on stage?
Ross  No.
Joey  Noooo!!
[Scene  Monica and Rachel's, erm, Chandler and Joey's, the gang minus Monica and Rachel
are eating breakfast. Ross and Chandler are sitting at the foosball table and eating.]
Chandler  So uh, man, are you gonna go to the play with me tonight?
Ross  Yknow what, I dont know how comfortable I am going to see how
hot the sex is between some guy and your girlfriend.
Chandler  Yeah, I know but
Ross  Oh no-no-no, Im there.
Monica  (entering) Hey!
Joey  Hey Mon! Want some pancakes?
Monica  You made pancakes?
Joey  Yep! Grab a plate.
Monica  Okay. (She does so and starts to walk towards Joey to receive her
pancakes.)
Joey  No-no, stay right there. (Monica stops and Joey flips her a pancake, which
flies over her head and lands in the living room.) Gettin closer.
Chandler  Okay, okay, but dont worry, because we also have cereals,
muffins, waffles, and, jams, jellies, and marmalades. Which Im fairly certain
are the same thing.
Joey  Listen also were uh, were watching the game here Saturday
night, if people want to come over.
Ross  Oh yeah!
Monica  Oh, I was thinking about having people over for the game.
Joey  Oh yeah, whos playing?
Monica  The players.
Ross  Somebody seems to be missing being the hostess.
Monica  (laughs) Please, its a relief is what it is, is what it is.
Joey  All right Pheebs, stick out your plate!
Phoebe  Oh. (Joey flips the pancake and Phoebe catches it and throws it on her
plate.)
[Scene  Bloomingdales, Rachels new job.]
Rachel  (on the phone) Monica, Im quitting! I just helped an 81 year old
woman put on a thong and she didnt even buy it! (Pause) Im telling you
Im quitting! Thats it! Im talking to my boss right now! (Pause) Yes I
am! (Pause) Yes I am! Yes I am! Yes I am! Yes I am! Yes I am! Okay bye, call me when you
get this message. (Hangs up as her boss, Mr. Waltham, walks in.) Oh! Mr. Waltham, I ah
really need to talk to you.
Mr. Waltham  In a moment, please, Im in the middle of a task. And you have
a customer.
Rachel  Hi!
Joshua  Hi, Im Joshua.
Rachel  Hi, Im Rachel Green. What can I do for you Joshua?
Joshua  Well, I need a whole new wardrobe. My wife, well my ex-wife
Rachel  Oh, Im so sorry.
Joshua  Anyway, she burned all of my clothes. I got away with two things. This
suit and what turned out to be a skirt.
Rachel  Well, at least thats a great suit.
Joshua  Yeah, but it wasnt much fun dropping it off at the dry cleaners in
the skirt. (Rachel laughs) So I need everything down to underwear, so if youre
willing, Im all yours.
Rachel  Okay.
Mr. Waltham  Rachel, you needed to speak to me?
Rachel  No-no, that wasnt me! (To Joshua) Well, we should get started. Let
me show you my underwear. (Joshua turns at that) The selection of underwear we carry.
Rachel  Oh-oh, sorry, its this way, its this way. (Motions to the
correct way.)
Joshua  Its this way? Sorry. (He walks past her and she again admires his
butt.)
[Scene  Kathys play, Ross and Chandler are waiting for her in the lobby after the
play.]
Chandler  Im right! Right? There was like no chemistry between them.
Before they had heat, and now theres no heat! Now you know what this means, Joey
told us what this means!
Ross  All right, lets not jump to any conclusions. All right? There was
some sexual chemistry between them.
Chandler  Come on, it was like cousins having sex up there!
Ross  Here she comes. Dont say a word, okay? Just be cool, dont
bey'know you.
Kathy  Hey you guys!
Ross  Hey!
Kathy  Hi! (Kisses Chandler) Thank you so much for coming again. Did you like it
tonight?
Ross  Oh, absolutely! (Chandler mumbles something.)
Kathy  Wasnt Nick funny when he couldnt get his match lit?
Kathy  Its a good play, isnt it?
Chandler  Oh, I loved the play. You were great, and Nick ditto. Clearly
youre having sex with him.
Ross  Okay, I (Walks away.)
Kathy  Clearly, Im having sex with him?
Chandler  Oh come on, it was so obvious! There was no chemistry between you two!
Kathy  Okay, so let me just get this straight. Youre accusing me of
cheating on you, and insulting my performance?
Chandler  Yknow, I-I could see how this could happen, y'know youre
up there every night, youre naked, touching, kissing.
Kathy  Acting! Chandler, this is my job! Im-Im playing a part in a
play! How can you not trust me?!
Chandler  Well, you can understand, given how we started.
Kathy  Oh, wow. I cant believe youre throwing that in my face.
Chandler  Well, that is what happened, and I dont even see you denying
this!
Kathy  Ill tell you what, Chandler, why dont you call me when you
grow up!
Chandler  Yeah, well, dont expect that to happen anytime soon!
[Scene  Monica and Rachel's, erm, Chandler and Joey's, Joey, Phoebe, and Ross are there
eating pizza as Rachel enters.]
Rachel  I have the best job in the entire world! The most adorable guy came over
today, and I got to dress him up all day!
Phoebe  Rachel has a new doll.
Rachel  Oh, I wish he was a doll, then I could get a Rachel doll and bump them
together and make kissy noises. Oh! And he has the most beautiful name, I never realised
it, Joshua! Josh-u-a! Joshua! Josh.
Ross  Uh, hello!
Rachel  Hi-e!!
Phoebe  Ooh, what do I smell?
Joey  I dont know, it smells good.
Monica  Fresh cookies! Hot from the oven!
Phoebe  Ooh! (They all go over to her apartment)
Monica  Please, have some!
Ross  Oh, yumm!
Monica  Yeah, Ive just been fiddling around in here making delicious
treats for everyone.
Joey  (Holding a magazine) Wow! The new Playboy!
Monica  Yeah, its just something I picked up.
Ross  Cookies and porn, youre the best mom ever!!
Phoebe  What? What?
Rachel  Well, it was just something Josh said about v-necks, but you had to be
there.
Ross  Yeah, how does Jason look in a v-neck?
Rachel  Its Joshua.
Ross  Oh, whatever. (Laughs and gives Joey the thumbs up heading back to his
apartment. Joey follows him)
Monica  Wait! Wait! This isnt take-out!
Phoebe  (getting up) Well, I hate to eat and run, but
Monica  No, wait, please dont go! Ive got porn for you too!
Phoebe  Yeah, I dont need it.
Monica  People are supposed to wanna hang out here!
Rachel  Why? Honey, what is the big deal?
Monica  Im the hostess! Not those guys! Im always the hostess! I
mean, I was always the hostess, I mean even when I was little, I mean the girls brought
their dollies to my tea party, I-I served the best air.
Phoebe  Well, why did you make like a whole big thing out of y'know, everyone
has to hang out in the big apartment?
Monica  Cause they took our apartment, I wanted to punish them. But
Im-Im done now. Theyve suffered enough.
Phoebe  If you wanted to punish them, you shouldve just made them hang out
here!
Rachel  Yeah, thats true.
Monica  All right then, when Im done with this place, its gonna be
ten times better than that place!
Phoebe  Oh, are we gonna trash that place?
Chandler  Steps! (He opens the door to his apartment to Ross and Joey looking at
the new Playboy) Slut! (Ross and Joey quickly hide the Playboy behind
their backs. Chandler wonders into the girls apartment.) You will all be very happy
to hear that Kathy is sleeping with that guy!
All  What?!
Ross  So you were right?
Chandler  I confronted her, and she didnt deny it! (Pause) I dont
live here! (Goes back into his apartment and they all follow him.)
Ross  Chandler!
Rachel  Chandler, what did she say?
Phoebe  Wait a minute.
Joey  Come here.
Monica  Are you sure?
Chandler  Well, I may be drunk, but I know what she said! Then I went over to Beefsteak
Julies
Rachel  Beefsteak Charlies?
Chandler  Yes! See you and I have always been like(motions that they think
the same.)
[Scene  The hallway between the apartments, Monica is lugging one of those floor
polishing machines through the hallway. Rachel comes up the steps and stops when she sees
Monica.]
Rachel  Whoops. (Starts to go into Chandler and Joeys.) Oh, hey, do you
need help with that?
Monica  Nah, I got it.
Rachel  Ooh, I just feel bad, I never vacuum. (She goes into Chandler and
Joeys.)
Rachel  Hi!
All  Hey!
Rachel  So I was with Joshua for an hour today, and he has not asked me out.
Its just so frustrating!
Phoebe  Why dont you ask him out?
Joey  Oh, yeah, totally! Thats such a turn-on!
Rachel  Really? It doesnt seem desperate?
Joey  Oh-ooh, thats the turn-on.
Phoebe  He just got a divorce right?
Rachel  Hmm-mmm.
Phoebe  So hes probably really nervous around women, y'know? Maybe, you
just have to make the first move.
Rachel  Yeah but, Ive never asked a guy out before.
Phoebe  (shocked) Youve never asked a guy out?!!
Rachel  No. Have you?
Phoebe  Thousands of times!! That doesnt make me sound too good does it?
Rachel  I dont even know how I would go about it.
Joey  Oh-oh-oh-oh, how I do it is, I look a woman up and down and say,
"Hey, how you doin?"
Phoebe  Oh, please!
Joey  (to Phoebe) Hey, how you doin?
Rachel  You know what, Im gonna do that, Im gonna call him up, and
Im gonna ask him out. I can do that. Ask him out. (Practising) How you doin?
(Calls him) Hi! Joshua? Its Rachel Green from Bloomingdales.
(Listens) Yeah, umm, I was wondering if you umm, if you umm, left your wallet at the store
today? Well, we found a wallet, and we(Listens) the license? Well, that is a
good idea! Uh, well, lets see here this says this license belongs to a uh, uh,
belongs to a mister uh, Pheebs, and umm, yeah, so sorry to bother you at home. Ill
see you tomorrow. Bye. (Hangs up) (to Phoebe) Youve done that a thousand times?
Phoebe  Ive never done that.
Rachel  Ohh, God, I just got so nervous that he would say no.
Joey  Well, you gotta give him something that he cant say no too. Like uh,
Knicks tickets! Invite the guy to a Knicks game, youre guaranteed hell say
yes!
Rachel  Really?! You think that will work?
Joey  Absolutely! And if it doesnt, can I get the extra ticket?
Joey  What the heck is that?
[Scene  Monica and Rachel's, erm, Chandler and Joey's, Ross, Joey, and Phoebe are
watching a movie as Chandler comes in from his bedroom.]
Chandler  Did she call?
Phoebe  No, sorry.
Chandler  All right, maybe I should call her.
Joey  No! Forget her, man! You dont need her, you dont need that!
Ross  Hes right, what she did was unforgivable.
Chandler  Well, yeah, but y'know, what-what if I was wrong?
Ross  How might you be wrong?
Chandler  Well y'know, what if she didnt actually sleep with the guy?
Joey  Dude, tell me she actually told you this.
Chandler  She did not have to tell me, I saw the play, and there was no heat.
Back me up here, Ross!
Ross  Thats all youre basing this on?
Chandler  Thats not backing me up! Look, you said with the off-stage and
the heat, and the onstage and the oy heat.
Joey  Whoa-whoa, that-that was just a theory! Theres a lot of theories
that didnt pan out. The lone gunman. Communism. Geometry.
Chandler  Oh my God!!
[Scene  Bloomingdales, Rachels new job, she is waiting for Joshua
and practising how to ask him out.]
Rachel  Would you like to go to a basketball game with me? (Tries again.) You
know, its funny, basketball, because I happen to have tickets too (Tries again.)
Umm, who likes the Knicks(Joshua comes in from the dressing room.)
Joshua  What do you think?
Rachel  Oh! Well, as a single woman, who is available, I think you look great!
Joshua  Huh. (She starts brushing the lint off and checking him out in the
mirror.) Yeah?
Rachel  Yep. Oh, yeah, look you great. (She puts her arm in his and checks how
they would look as a couple.) Oh yeah. Yeah, this looks great. (Pause) Umm, so you like
it?
Joshua  I do. I do. I love it. In fact, I think Im gonna wear it home.
Rachel  Great.
Joshua  All right, thank you so much for all your help.
Rachel  Sure.
Joshua  Well, I guess this is uh, I guess this is it.
Rachel  Yeah-eah-ha!
Joshua  Thanks. (He starts to leave) Maybe Ill see in the spring, with the
uh, yknow, for the uh, bathing suits.
Rachel  Oh well, you dont want to do that now?!
Joshua  Ah, thats okay, thanks.
Rachel  Okay.
Joshua  Anyway, hopefully, Ill see you around sometime. (He goes out the
door.)
Rachel  Basketball!
Joshua  (coming back in) Im sorry.
Rachel  I uh, I have two tickets to the Knicks game tonight if youre
interested, just as a thank you for this week.
Joshua  Wow! That would be great.
Rachel  Really?
Joshua  Yeah, that would be fantastic! My-my nephew is crazy about the Knicks!
This is fantastic, thank you so much Rachel. (He takes the tickets and leaves as Mr.
Waltham returns.)
Mr. Waltham  Good morning.
Joshua  Hi!
[Scene  Kathys apartment, Chandler is knocking on the door.]
Kathy  (opening the door) Hey.
Chandler  Hey. I just, I just wanted to come over to-to say that Im sorry.
Yknow? I know I acted like the biggest idiot in the world, and I can completely
understand why you were so upset.
Kathy  Oh wow. I really wish youd call me.
Chandler  Yeah, I know, I-I wish I had too, but yknow I-I think this is a
good thing. Y'know? Cause weve had our first fight, and now we can move on.
Yknow, I know for me(Notices a pair of mens pants on the chair.)
Nicks pants?
Kathy  Yeah.
Chandler  Yeah. Well, I think our second fight is going to be a big one!
[Scene  Monica and Rachel's, erm, Chandler and Joey's, Joey is debriefing Rachel on her
rejection earlier that day and telling her what she shouldve done. Ross and Phoebe
are watching.]
Joey  Okay, for next time, what do you say?
Rachel  I have an extra ticket. An extra ticket. Not, two tickets, I have an
extra ticket.
Ross  So the first time you ask a guy out, he-he turns you down?
Rachel  He didnt turn me down! Hes at the game isnt he? I got
the date, Im just not on it!
Monica  (entering) Okay, its ready. Come on.
Joey  Whats ready?
Monica  Just come.
Ross  Oh my God!
Rachel  Wow! Monica!
Phoebe  Great!
Ross  This is beautiful!
Phoebe  Oh did youwhat did youdid you work for two days straight?
Monica  Pretty much. (to Joey) So, what do you, what do you think of the floor?
Joey  I dont know, it looks the same.
Monica  You used to have carpet.
Joey  Oh yeah!
Monica  So I made snacks. Please, just hang out okay? Im just gonna rest
my eyes just a little bit.
Ross  Look, Mon, do you want us to uh, come back later?
Monica  Oh no-no-no, stay, stay, stay, just keep talking. Im always the
hostess.
Ross  Hey!
Joey  Howd it go?
Chandler  Well, she wasnt sleeping with him.
Phoebe  Oh good!
Chandler  She is now.
Ross  What are you saying?
Chandler  Im saying that she is a devil woman! Yknow I mean
you think you know someone and then they turn around and they sleep with Nick! Nick, with
his rock hard pecs, and his giant man-nipples! I hate him, I hate her! Well, I
dont hate her, I love her. This is all my fault really.
Phoebe  How? How is your fault?
Chandler  Because, I-I shouldve called! Yknow if I had just called
her after our big, stupid fight, she never wouldve gone out with Nick, and they
wouldve ended up in bed together. I threw her at his man nipples!
Rachel  Honey, this is not your fault, just because you guys had a fight, it
does not justify her sleeping with someone.
Ross  Well, if-if she thought they were on a break
[Scene  Bloomingdales, Rachel is sitting at her desk as Mr. Waltham
comes in.]
Mr. Waltham  Rachel, one of your customers seems to have left his billfold. A
Joshua Bergen.
Rachel  Really?
Mr. Waltham  Will you call him?
Rachel  Yes! I will! Absolutely! (She takes out his license and her license and
holds them face to face with each other. She then proceeds to act like Dark Helmut in Spaceballs,
and mimic a conversation between the two of them.) Hello, Rachel. Hi, Joshua. I left my
wallet here on purpose. Really? Yes, I just wanted to see you again. Oh, Im glad.
Rachel, Id like to say something to you. Yes? How you doin?
[Scene  Monica and Rachel's, erm, Chandler and Joey's, Joey is getting ready for a
fishing trip and Phoebe is asking him about the fishing lures. Ross is playing with the
rod, and Monica is pretty much just watching the on goings.]
Phoebe  (holding a lure) So now, what is this now?
Joey  Guggly worm.
Phoebe  (laughs and picks up another lure) And this?
Joey  Glow-pop giggly jammer.
Phoebe  (laughs harder) You make it so funny.
Monica  (not wanting to be left out, picks up something) Hey umm, whats
this?
Joey  (examining it) Ohh, a hunk of sandwich from last year. (Monica drops the
sandwich)
Ross  (pretend fishing in the living room) Ohh, Gellers got one hooked!
Ohh! Looks like a big one! Yeah, ohh! Ohh! (Swinging the rod back and forth) Its the
classic struggle between man and(swings the rod and knocks over a lamp.) Someone
knocked over a lamp.
Joey  (going over and picking up the rod) Thats all right. Hey you guys,
you know whats going to be great about the fishing trip this year? When my dad gets
me out in the middle of the lake and gives me that, "Joey, what are you doing with
your life?" stuff. I can say, "Well, Im doing a movie with Charlton Heston
dad. What are you doing with your life?"
All  Great!
Chandler  You dont have to stop having fun just because Im here.
Kathy didnt cheat on all of you. (To Joey) Well, except you. (They hug and Chandler
goes into the bathroom with the chick and duck following him.)
Monica  Hey, Joey, I dont think that you should leave Chandler alone. I
mean its only been two days since he broke up with Kathy. Maybe you can go fishing
next week?
Joey  Look, theres nothing I can do for him right now, hes still in
his sweat pants, thats still Phase One. Y'know? Ill be back for Phase Two, I
would never miss Phase Two.
Monica  Whats Phase Two?
Joey  Gettin drunk and going to a strip club.
Rachel  How does going to a strip club help him better?
Ross  Because there are naked ladies there.
Joey  Which helps him get to Phase Three, picturing yourself with other women.
Ross  There are naked ladies there too.
Joey  Yeah.
Chandler  (opening the bathroom door and kicking out the chick and duck) Would
you give me one minute!! Please.
[Scene  Bloomingdales, Rachel is still dressing Joshua. He is trying on a pair of
pants.]
Joshua  So, these will match the jacket you picked out for me last week?
Rachel  Um-hmm. (Joshua turns to look in the mirror and leaves Rachel staring at
his ass.) There we go. There it is.
Joshua  (turning around) Oh! You know what I need?
Rachel  Yeah!
Joshua  Gloves. Brown, leather dress gloves.
Rachel  Oh, okay. Uhh, well lets see. (Grabs his hand.) Youre
aboutwell uh, this one is large. And this one(Grabs the other hand.)
Joshua  Also large?
Rachel  Yeah! Okay, two larges coming right up!
Joshua  Okay.
Mr. Waltham  (entering) Rachel! Could I have a moment?
Rachel  Yes.
Mr. Waltham  I-I was wondering, my niece you see is in from Londonwell
Shropshire really but yknowwell shes about your age I say. Anyway I have
tickets for the opera, Die Fledermaus, and I was wondering if youd like to keep her
company this evening?
Rachel  Sure. You got it. Great!
Mr. Waltham  Oh, good.
Rachel  Me, Fledermaus, great. I really(motions to Joshua.)
Mr. Waltham  Ohh! Yes of course, thank you, thank you, thank you so very much.
Joshua  So(Holds out his hands as to say, "Where are my
gloves?")
Rachel  So? (She puts her hands in his, totally forgetting about the gloves, and
hoping for something more intimate.)
Joshua  Gloves?
Rachel  Ohh! Right! Right, sorry, Ill be right back!
Joshua  Uhh, actually yknow what, I kindaI have to take off.
Rachel  Oh.
Joshua  But, I was curious; do you have any plans for tonight?
Rachel  No! Nothing!
Joshua  I invested in this night-club and its opening tonight, would you
like to come?
Rachel  Yeah! That would be great!
Joshua  Youre into hardcore S&M right?
Rachel  (shocked) Well, I-I guessI
Joshua  Kidding! (Rachel is relived) Im gonna get there early, but
Im going to put you on the V.I.P list, okay? Look for me.
Rachel  Yeah, great, you betcha!
Mr. Waltham  (entering) I almost forget the tickets, didnt I?
Rachel  What?
Mr. Waltham  For you and Emily, tonight, Die Fledermaus.
Rachel  Oh. Oh, right.
Mr. Waltham  I think youll like it, it has two out of the three tenors.
Rachel  Oh yay!
[Scene  Monica and Rachel's, erm, Chandler and Joey's, Chandler is in his sweats
flinging playing cards into a pot.]
Chandler  Yknow, I cant believe Kathy did this too me. I really,
thought that she was the one. I tell you what, from now on Im never getting out of
this chair, ever! Okay? From now on, this chair is the one! You wanna what else is the
one? My sweat pants!
Ross  Come on, man! Just-just take the sweats off. Okay? Just take em off
and well have some fun.
Joey  (entering) Hey-hey!
Ross  Hi!
Phoebe  Hey!
Ross  Catch any big fish? (Phoebe, Ross, and Monica all go over to him.)
Joey  Oh my God, you guys have no idea.
All  (they all recoil from the smell emanating from him) Oh! God! Wow!
Monica  You stink!
Ross  Are you kidding?!
Joey  Yeah, three days on the lake without a shower. Plus! I fell in that big
tub of worms at the bait stand! Hey, how-hows he doing?
Ross  He hasnt gotten out of that chair in two days.
Joey  (goes over to Chandler) Hey buddy! Hows it going?
Joey  (To the rest of the gang) Hey, see that? He just needed his pal to come
home. All right, uh, Ive got to go memorise my lines. (Starts to go his bedroom) Me
and Charlton Heston bright and early tomorrow morning! Yeah-yeah!
Rachel  (entering) Hey!
Ross  Hey!
Rachel  Hey, Monica!
Monica  Uh-oh, whats the matter?
Rachel  Ohh, its Joshua invited me to this fancy club opening tonight.
But, I already told Mr. Waltham that I would take his niece to this dumb old opera.
So What are you gonna do?
Monica  I dont know sweetie.
Rachel  No! Help me!
Monica  I cant! I have to work!
Rachel  Phoebe?
Phoebe  I would, but I get my morning sickness in the evening.
Rachel  Ugh!
Phoebe  Unless! She wants to spend the night holding my hair back for me.
Rachel  Ohh, gosh. You guys, come on, this isI have to meet Joshua! This
is my one chance for him to see the fun Rachel. Yknow the "Wouldnt it be
great if she was my wife" Rachel. Ohh, all right! Are Joey and Chandler back?
Monica  No, Chandlers still in Phase One, and Joeys that thing you
smell.
Rachel  Ohh! (Realises that Ross is in the room.) Hi!
Ross  Hi!
Rachel  So.
Ross  No.
Rachel  Ohhhh, come on!!!
Monica  I think shes here.
Rachel  No! Wait! Wait-wait! Ross, please!
Ross  You want me to take some girl Ive never met to the opera so you can
go to a club and flirt with some guy, hmm, that-that is a toughie.
Monica  (looking out the peephole) Ohh, shes looking down the hall. Oh!
She looked right at me! Oh wait, you cant see people through that little hole, can
you? (Goes back to the door.) Hello!
Woman  Hello! (Monica screams)
Rachel  Ill be right there! (to Ross) Okay, Ross, please come on! I
thought we have moved on! I thought weve gotten to a place where we could be happy
for each other! I mean was that just me?
Ross  All right, Ill do it.
Rachel  Oh thank you! Thank you, thank you, thank you! (Monica opens the door.)
Emily?
Emily  Yes.
Rachel  Im Rachel Green.
Emily  Thank goodness.
Rachel  Theres been a teeny-teeny change in plans. It turns out that
Im not free tonight. So
Emily  Really?! Well, thats just lovely, isnt it? I mustve
missed your call, even though I didnt leave the flat all day.
Rachel  Oh well, no I
Emily  Oh, no-no-no, thats not rude! Its perfectly in keeping with a
trip that Ive already been run down by one of your wiener carts, and been
strip-searched at John F. Kennedy Airport, apparently to you people, I look like someone
whos got a balloon full of cocaine stuffed up their bum.
Monica  I-I-I think you look great.
Emily  Good night, it was very nice to meet you all. (Storms out.)
Rachel  Ill get her.
Ross  Please hurry.
Phoebe  Dont you just love the way they talk?!
[Scene  Monica and Rachel's, erm, Chandler and Joey's, the next morning, Monica and
Phoebe are eating breakfast.]
Phoebe  Ohh!
Monica  What?
Phoebe  It kicked! I think the baby kicked!
Monica  Oh my God!
Phoebe  Oh no wait, oh no, the elastic on my underwear busted.
Joey  (running from his bedroom) Oh my God! I overslept! I was supposed to be on
the set a half an hour ago! I gotta get out of here!
Monica  Oh wait, Joey, you cant go like that! You stink!
Joey  Look, I know I feel asleep before I could shower and now I dont have
time! Theyre just ten blocks away, if I run, I can make it.
Monica  Yeah. Run ten blocks, thatll help the smell.
Rachel  Heywhoa, slow down. (Gets a whiff of him) No, keep moving. (Joey
runs off.) Wow!
Monica  So? How did it go with Joshua last night?
Rachel  Well, I didnt see Joshua last night, but I did punch a girl
in the face.
Monica  What?
Phoebe  Why?
Rachel  The whole night was horrible, it was pouring down rain, and when I got
there, there was no Rachel Green on the list, but there was a Rachel Greep.
Phoebe  Ohh! So, did you get to meet her?
Rachel  No, there is no Rachel Greep, but then this other girl overheard us and
she was all, "Im Rachel Greep! Im Rachel Greep!" and he let her
right in.
Monica  So you hit her in the face?
Rachel  No, she was already in, but then this big bitch behind me tried to steal
my umbrella, so I clocked her. Ohhh! I cant believe this, all I wanted was a few
hours outside of work to see Joshua, so he can go ahead and start falling in love with me.
Phoebe  (going over to comfort her) Aww, Pheebs.
Rachel  Honey, thats youre name.
Phoebe  Thats short for Phoebe?! I thought that was just what we called
each other!
Monica  Hey! Youre wearing pants!
Chandler  Thats right! Where are the guys? Im ready to get drunk and
see some strippers.
Chandler  They got a breakfast buffet.
Monica  Hello. (Listens) Oh, hey Ross!
Chandler  Ooh, let me talk to him!
Monica  Oh-oh, my God!
Chandler  Well, can I just
Monica  (to Chandler) Shh!! (On phone) Wait, what?
Chandler  Shes shhing me! Its my phone and shes shhing me!
Phoebe  Shhh!! Please! Whats he saying?
Monica  Hes with Emily at a Bed and Breakfast in Vermont!
Phoebe  What? Oh my God!
Rachel  What? Who the hell is Emily(realises) noooo!!
[Scene  Chandler and Joey's, erm, Monica and Rachel's, scene continued from earlier.]
Rachel  Theyre in Vermont!! How could this happen?! (She waves her arms
franticly and hits Chandler.)
Chandler  Ow!
Rachel  Howhow did end up in Vermont with that awful witch?! (She hits
Chandler again.)
Chandler  Maybe, she doesnt hit him all the time.
Ross  When we first met her, she was soaking, her feet were wet! Who
wouldnt be miserable? Im telling you when I got her into a dry pair of shoes,
she was a totally different person.
Emily  (rushing in) Ross! Come quickly! Theres a deer just outside eating
fruit from the orchard!
Ross  Ive gotta go, theres a deer just outside eating fruit from the
orchard! (He hangs up and runs out.)
Monica  He had to go, theres a deer just outside eating fruit from the
orchard.
Rachel  I dont get this! She was horrible! (She hits Chandler, yet again.)
Chandler  Okay, Im going to go stand over there. (Points and moves into
the living room.)
Monica  Why do you care so much anyway?
Rachel  I dont care! All right, yknow what Im just upset that
Im getting nowhere with Joshua thatyknow what still, you do not meet
someone and go flitting off to Vermont!
Monica  Well, when you first met Barry, you flitted off to Vail.
Rachel  Oh, yknow, would you just for once, not remember
everylittlething!! (Storms out.)
Chandler  So yknow, uh, whens he getting back?
Monica  A couple of days.
Chandler  Yknow, I knew something like this was going to happen. (He
starts to take off his pants, revealing that he is still wearing his sweat pants.)
Monica  What are you doing?! Chandler! You cant just go back a phase!
Chandler  Yes you can. Youre thinking about time, you cant go back
in time.
Phoebe  Well, look, why dont you just, why dont you do your Phase
Two strip club thing with us.
Monica  Yeah, come on, we can be guys!
Chandler  (laughs) No you cant.
Phoebe  Come on! Let us be guys! Maybe we want to be guys!
Chandler  You dont want to be guys, youd be all hairy and
wouldnt live as long. (Starts to go to his bedroom)
Phoebe  Yknow you, you just stop being such a wuss and get those off and
you come with us and watch naked girls dance around!!
Chandler  Okay. (Starts to cry)
Phoebe  Im sorry. (Goes and hugs him)
[Scene  Silvercup Studios, Joey is just arriving for his scene.]
Joey  (rushing in) Hey! Joey Tribbiani! Im here! Im here!
The A.D  Calm down, we got time, were running a little late.
Joey  Look at that, Charlton Heston eating a liquorice whip!
The A.D  Yeah, we loves em. Ive never seen him with(He gets a
whiff of Joey and starts smelling around.)
Joey  (trying to act like hes not the one that stinks.) Whoa! Yeah, what
the hell is that? What smells so bad?
The A.D  You.
Joey  Yknow, I can see why you think that, but ah, actually, you know who
I think it is?
The A.D  You?
Joey  No-no, its uh, its Heston.
The A.D  What?
Joey  Yeah, the man wreaks! Smells like he went on a three day fishing trip and
then ate some liquorice.
The A.D  Theres no way he smells, hes the only one around here with
a shower in his dressing room.
Joey  Really, a shower huh? And uh, which-which room might that be?
The A.D  The one with "Heston" on it.
Joey  Interesting.
[Scene  A strip club, the girls are there with Chandler, who isnt enjoying
himself.]
Monica  (coming back to the stage and sitting next to Chandler) Okay, Ive
got some Ones, you wanna put them in her panties?
Chandler  No thanks, Mom!
Phoebe  Oh, no umm, hi, that-that, you have to put that out, cause
Im pregnant.
The Cigarette Smoking Guy  (No, not the Cigarette Smoking Man from The
X-Files.) Well, maybe you and your baby should go to another strip club.
Phoebe  Ha-ha, its not my baby, ha-ha-ha! (He leaves.)
Monica  Very good, (getting up and sliding a One into the dancers hot
pants) so good.
Phoebe  (doing the same) I really, really enjoyed it. Very exotic.
Rachel  (joining them) Well, I just checked our messages and Joshua didnt
call. I mean youd think hed be worried about me not showing up at his club.
Ugh, you know what makes it so much worse, Ross is all happy in Vermont!
Phoebe  Come on! Look where you are!!
Monica  (to the waitress) When you get a sec, another round of daiquiris.
Phoebe  Remember, a virgin for me please.
Monica  Oh! And dont let me leave without getting the name of that carpet
guy.
Chandler  Ahh, come on! Yknow whatyknow what, I think Im
just gonna go home and call Kathy.
Phoebe  Well, if you think it will help.
Chandler  No! That was a test! In a couple of hours Im gonna get really
drunk and wanna call Kathy and you guys are gonna have to stop me! And then after that,
Im gonna get so drunk, Im gonna wanna call Janice
Phoebe  You should! How is she?
Chandler  Ohhh!!
Monica  I think somebody needs another lap dance. (Motions for one.)
[Scene  Silvercup studios, Joey is taking a shower in Charlton Hestons dressing
room. Heston enters the room, Joey panics, and walks over to the shower and confronts Joey
about the use of his shower.]
Charlton Heston  Hello! Whos in there? (He opens to curtain to reveal a
naked and wet Joey.)
Joey  How ya doin?
Charlton Heston  Who in the hell are you?
Joey  I guess you wouldnt believe me if I said I was Kurt Douglas, huh?
Charlton Heston  Put some pants on kid so I can kick your butt.
Joey  No-no-no, no, no, wait. You see, Im an actor, Joey Tribbiani,
Im doing a scene with you today, and well, I stink.
Charlton Heston  (shocked) Youre in this picture?
Joey  Yeah-yeah, Im one of the cops that wont work with you
cause you a lose cannon. Anyway, look, Im really sorry, but I stink!
Charlton Heston  Joey, right?
Joey  Yeah.
Charlton Heston  (tosses him a towel, motions for him to get out of the shower
and sits down on the couch) Every actor at one time or anotheropp! (Joey tries to
sit down next to him and Heston makes him sit somewhere else.) Every actor thinks he
stinks, even Lawrence Oliver at sometimes thought he stank, Bob Redford wont even
watch himself.
Joey  Oh no-no-no, you dont understand
Charlton Heston  Listen to me!
Joey  Oh yeah, yeah.
Charlton Heston  I dont know one actor worth his salt that didnt say
at one time or another, "God, I stink!" Hell, I just did a scene out there,
first take, I stunk the place up. But, the important thing you must remember, no matter
how badly you think you might stink, you must never, ever bust into my dressing room and
use my shower! Do you understand me?!
Joey  Yes sir! Yes sir, Im-Im(he starts to leave)
Charlton Heston  Wait a minute! Take your pants.
Joey  Yeah. Oh, yeah.
[Scene  Chandler and Joey's, erm, Monica and Rachel's, Chandler, Monica, and Phoebe are
returning from the strip club.]
Monica  So, we did okay at the strip club, right?
Chandler  Oh yeah, that was great. Thanks to you, the hottest cocktail waitress
there is quitting to teach the third grade!
Rachel  (entering) I cant believe it! He still hasnt called.
Phoebe  Who, Josh?
Rachel  Its Joshua.
Monica  What, he doesnt like Josh?
Rachel  No, I dont.
Chandler  All right, well Im gonna put my sweats back on.
Phoebe  Oh no! Wait! Wait! Okay, yknow what, you were right, you were
right. We really werent great at being guys, but you know why? Because were
girls.
Chandler  Yeah?
Phoebe  And do you know what girls are really good at?
Chandler  Stripping!
Phoebe  No, listening! Sit! Yknow, maybe it would just really, really help
if you would just talk.
Rachel  Yeah, come on! Whats going in on in there? (Pats his chest.)
Monica  Yeah. And yknow, if you wanna cry, thats okay too.
Chandler  Okay, look, Im gonna have to ask you all to leave.
Monica  Come on! Chandler!
Chandler  Look, forget it. We tried, but Phase Three is a lost cause, Okay?
Those strippers were insanely hot, and I couldnt picture myself with any of them.
(Sits back in disgust.)
Monica  They really were pretty, werent they? (Rachel and Phoebe both
agree)
Phoebe  Yeah, I really liked that fighter pilot one.
Monica  Oh, Candy! She was so spunky!
Phoebe  Yeah.
Monica  Yknow, I think if I were going to be with a woman. (Chandler is
intrigued.) Itd, itd be with someone like Michelle, she was so oh, she was so
petite.
Rachel  See, I dont know, for me it would have to Chantal.
Monica  Oh, Chantal!
Rachel  Oh my goodness, she had the smoothest skin! I mean when I stuck that
dollar bill in her g-string and grazed her thigh
Chandler  (jumping up) Phase Three! I just achieved Phase Three!
Monica  Really?!
Chandler  I am totally picturing you with all those women!
Monica  Thats-thats not Phase Three.
Chandler  Well, Im there too!
Rachel  Well, are we all together? Like in a group?
Chandler  Stop it! Youre killing me! I think I just moved on to Phase
Four!
Phoebe  Oh! What is that? What is that?
Chandler  Where I dont want to have a relationship ever! I just want to
have sex with strippers and my friends!!
[Scene  Central Perk, the gang is there, minus Ross. Chandler is trying to cheer Joey
up about missing Phase Two.]
Chandler  Come on, let me see that smile.
Joey  I dont wanna.
Chandler  Please?
Joey  I wanted to go to the strip club!
Chandler  I know, I know, but youre gonna have plenty of chances. There
are literally thousands of women out there just waiting to screw me over.
Joey  Yeah, all right. (Ross enters.)
Monica  Hey!
Ross  Hey!
Phoebe  Heyooh so, how was Vermont?
Ross  Emily isincredible. I mean there-there are no words to describe it,
I mean the whole weekend was like a dream. (Sees Rachel coming back from the bathroom.)
Oh! And you! Rach!
Rachel  Oh, hey!
Ross  Hey! You were so right!
Rachel  What?
Ross  Uh, what you said, about us being in a place where we could finally be
happy for each other.
Rachel  Oh, hmm.
Ross  I mean, I, I-I admit I-I wasnt quite there. Yknow, I mean the
thought of you and that-that Josh guy
Rachel  Joshua.
Ross  Joshuaguy at that club, dancing and having a good time, the thought
of it kindayknow.
Rachel  Yeah, I
Ross  But now! Im there! Im totally there! Im-Im finally
where you are!
Rachel  Oh, thank goodness!
Ross  Yeah, and-and thank you for Emily.
Rachel  Oh, no problem. Im so glad I could help. Happy for you. (She
playfully punches him.)
Ross  Happy for you. (He punches her back.)
Rachel  No, happy for you! (Hits him harder.)
[Scene  Chandler and Joey's, erm, Monica and Rachel's, Chandler is there and is getting
ready to direct a bunch of strippers, Monica, Rachel, and Phoebe on what to do in the
upcoming orgy of lesbian lust. Yes, its a dream sequence, this isnt cable.]
Chandler  All right ladies, heres what were gonna do. (Points to a
stripper.) You are gonna take off my clothes. (To another two strippers) You two,
go get the oils. (To another stripper) And you just constantly scream at the top of your
voice, "Chandlers the king! Chandlers the king!"
Phoebe  I-I wanna be with her, (points to the stripper next to her) I like her.
Chandler  Oh, thats fine! Go with your instincts, go with your instincts.
Monica  Wait, now, what am I doing again?
Chandler  Come on! Would you please pay attention, I could wake up at any
moment!
The Cigarette Guy  Hi, Im Joshua, Im here to pick up Rachel.
Rachel  No-no-no, that not Joshua.
Chandler  What do you want from me, Ive never met the guy. So anyway,
Rachel, Im sorry you cant stay, (Rachel is upset about leaving the orgy with
the cigarette guy.) but the rest of us have a lot of work to do. (The cigarette guy
starts rubbing Chandlers back.) What are you doing? (The guy just nods) All right,
listen, Ive got to wake up!

[Scene  A beauty parlour, Rachel is getting a manicure while Chandler, yes Chandler, is
getting a petticure (Does that scare you that I know those terms?  Well, it scares
me.).]
Chandler  Y'know, I can't believe I'm getting my nails done!  And you
said it was gonna be fun! (pause) Which it kinda is.  Also, you said there would be
other guys here. There are no other guys here!
Rachel  Chandler, theres a guy right over there. (Points to the counter)
Chandler  Thats a mailman! Thats our mailman! (Waves to the
mailman) (Sarcastic) Hi. How are ya?
Rachel  Chandler, dont worry! This doesnt make you any less of a
guy! (Chandler starts blowing on his fingernails like women do.) That does!
(Chandler stops blowing.) What am I sitting on? (She looks and finds a huge nail.) I hate
to think what this woman was scratching when this broke off.
Chandler  Hey, you know who used to have nails like that?
Rachel  Hmm.
Woman  OHMYGAWD!! (Yep, you guessed it. Its Janice.)
[Scene  Chandler and Joey's erm, Monica and Rachel's, Rachel and Joey are standing at
the counter. Monica is flipping a light switch on and off next to the door.]
Monica  Joey let me ask you a question. What does this light switch do?
Joey  Ohh, Nothing.
Monica  Didnt it drive you crazy to have a switch and not know what it
did?
Joey  I know what it did! Nothing.
Monica  They wouldnt have put it there if it didnt do something! How
can you not care?
Joey  Like this. (Shrugs)
Rachel  Well, heres another question for ya. Uhh, do you know what that
silver knob on the toilet does?
Joey  Sure! It flushes it.
Rachel  Okay, good. Now that since you know, when you come over would you mind
actually using it?
Chandler  (entering, with Janice in tow) Hello!
Joey  Hey! (Sees Janice.) Ah!! (Janice screams in surprise.)
Rachel  Guess who we ran into today?!
Monica  Janice?!
Chandler  Isnt this amazing?
Monica  How have you been?
Janice  Oh well, Im divorced.
Phoebe  Ohhh, wow.
Janice  Yeah, Im riding the alimony pony. (Does the now famous laugh.)
Joey  And there it is.
Janice  I just came up to say, "Hi!" Hi! (to Chandler) And you,
sweetie, Ill see you tonight.
Chandler  Okay. Bye.
Janice  Bye.
Chandler  Bye.
Janice  Bye.
Chandler  Bye.
Janice  Bye.
Chandler  B-bye!
Janice  Bye-bye.
Chandler  Bye. (Finally closes the door on her.) (After its closed) I
cant stand the woman! (Phoebe is shocked, Joey is relieved.)
Phoebe  What?! I thought you were crazy about her!
Chandler  Yeah, I know, but all of those little annoying things she did before
we fell in love? Like her voice, her laugh, her personalityWell, theyre all
back! Yknow? And shes picked up like nine new ones!
Joey  So what are you doing bringing her here?! Theres people here!
Chandler  Dont worry about it. Im taking care of it tonight.
(Chandler opens the fridge and grabs something to drink.)
Rachel  You are not. You have never been able to break up with her.
Chandler  (standing in the door of the fridge) Well, I dont have to break
up with her this time. Were not involved! Im going to do a pre-emptive strike!
Im going to end it with her before it starts. My ass is like frozen! (Closes the
fridge.)
Joey  Yeah, try sticking it in the freezer for 20 minutes. (They all look around
and then back at Joey.) Im tellin ya!
[Scene  A street, Ross and Emily are walking home from a date.]
Emily  I cant believe you really walk alone here! I mean, you hear such
stories about New York.
Ross  No, its really not that bad. I mean, I-I for one, feel perfectly
safe.
Ross  Help! Help!! Help! Help!!
Emily  No, no, no Ross! Ross, these are friends of mine from home. (Introducing
them) Liam, Devon, this is Ross.
Devon  Hey, mate.
Liam  How are ya man?
Ross  Oh hey, that was a good one, huh? (Imitating himself) Help! Help!
Emily  So how are you? Ive been meaning to ring you ever since I arrived
but umm, well, Ive been rather busy.
Devon  Do you realise that we have not seen each other since the night of that
U2 concert?
Emily  Oh my God. I think youre right.
Liam  (puts his arm around her) Well, actually the last time you and I saw each
other was that morning.
Emily  Oh, Liam. (Ross laughs and takes her back.)
Ross  Oh, Liam. So uh, what, were you guys playing soccer or somethingor
should I call it (In an English accent) football?
Devon  We were playing rugby.
Liam  In fact were playing a game at the park tomorrow. Youre
welcome to play too if you want.
Emily  (laughs) Ross play rugby? I dont think so.
Ross  Whats ah, whats so funny about that?
Emily  Well I mean, youre American to start with. You dont even have
rugby here.
Ross  Well, we didnt have freedom here until 1776, either so
Liam  Cheers!
Ross  Cheers!
[Scene  Central Perk, Chandler is attempting his pre-emptive strike.]
Janice  Oh boy, I just love to sing!
Chandler  Yes, I-I know that you do, but I think one of the reasons people were
complaining though, was that they paid to hear the actor sing Old Man River.
Janice  Oh, look at us! Who wouldve thought that Cupid had a station at
14th Street Nails. (Does the laugh)
Chandler  (laughs) Okay, we have to talk. Im just getting out of a very
serious relationship
Janice  I know! And Im just getting out of a marriage, I mean talk about
meant to be!
Chandler  Right! I just think that this is happening too soon.
Janice  Oh, too soon, too schmoon. Face it honey, I am not letting you get away
this time.
Chandler  I hear ya. (Pause) But! Unfortunately, my company is transferring me
overseas!
Janice  Oh no! Where to? (Gasps) Too Paris?
Chandler  No! No! Not, Paris.
Janice Too London? No-no, Rome? Vienna? Ooh-ooh, Barcelona?
Chandler  Okay, could you just stop talking for a second? (Thinks) Yemen.
Thats right, yes, Im being transferred to Yemen!
Janice  When?
Chandler  I dont know exactly.
Janice  Ugh, well I will just have to soak up every once of Chandler Bing until
that moment comes.
Chandler  But I do know that its some time tomorrow.
[Scene  Chandler and Joey's erm, Monica and Rachel's, Phoebe and Monica are plugging in
a bunch of electronics.]
Monica  Done?
Phoebe  Yep!
Rachel  (entering, with Joey) Hey!
Joey  Hey! Whats up?
Monica  This switch thing has been driving me crazy. So I turned it off and
checked every outlet. Now, four of them dont work. Which means, one of them
has to be controlled by the switch. So, I plugged in things in all four of the outlets
that-that make noise, so that way, when I turn it on I just follow the noise and find out
which one it is.
Joey  (to Rachel) I bet I stopped listening before you did.
Rachel  Yknow, you-you also couldve used uh, lamps and then
followed the light.
Monica  Yeah, well, Im using noise. Okay. All right! So, is everybody
ready? Here we go. (She flips on the switch and a hum starts.) I hear something! I hear
something! Where is it? (They all start looking until Rachel realises its Joey.)
Rachel  Its coming from Joey!
Phoebe  Oh my God, thats so freaky! Turn him off!!
[Scene  Monica and Rachel's erm, Chandler and Joey's, Ross, Joey, and Rachel are
watching rugby on TV as Phoebe enters.]
Phoebe  Ooh, hey, could we put on the news? I think it might be raining.
Ross  Oh, just hold on a second. Im watching this rugby thing on ESPN.
I dont know what the big deal is. Im man enough to play this sport.
Joey  Dude, youre not even man enough to order the channel that
carries the sport.
Janice  (entering) Hey there Ross!
Ross  (shocked) Hey!
Phoebe  (whispering to Ross) Janice.
Chandler  Yknow uh, you didnt really have to help me pack.
Janice  Ohh, well when you said all you were going to be doing between now and
the time you leave is packing, you didnt really leave me much choice. Did you?
Chandler  Well, I-I thought I did but, I-I guess I did not!
Joey  Hey-hey, whats going on?
Chandler  Oh, Im packing. Yknow Im-Im packing
cause Im moving to Yemen tomorrow.
Joey  Thanks for telling me!
Chandler  Im only going to pretend Im moving to Yemen, its the
only way I can get rid off her.
Joey  Ohhhh, good one! And Yemen that actually sounds like a real country.
Janice  (leaning in from the bedroom) Chandler! Come on, Im gonna show how
to roll up your underwear and stuff it in your shoes. Its a real space saver.
Phoebe  Yeah, I know, I do that cause it makes me look taller.
Janice  Okay, Chandler, come on!
Chandler  (to Janice) Okay. (to Joey) Joey, trade lives with me!
Joey  Nope. (To Ross) Man look at this! Ross, I cant believe you said
youd play rugby. I mean look how brutal this is!
Ross  Hey, I can handle it! All right?
Rachel  Please, Ross, you-you got hurt playing badminton with my dad.
Ross  Thats cause-cause youre moms dog kept-kept
looking at me.
Joey  (pointing to the TV) Okay, Ross, look-look-look-look, look right here.
Thats called a scrum, okay? Its kinda like a huddle.
Ross  And is a hum, kinda like a scruddle?
Joey  Ross! (Laughs) Theyre gonna kill you!
Phoebe  Well, why are you doing this anyway?
Ross  Well, you shouldve seen the guy that she used to go out with. I
mean, hes like Joe Rugby.
Phoebe  Youre kidding! And he plays rugby?! Thats so funny.
(Realises) Ohh! I see how you did that. All right.
Ross  Anyway, she thought the very idea of me playing rugby with him was
like hilarious. So Im gonna show her how tough I really am!
Rachel  (starts laughing, Ross stares at her) Im sorry. Im sorry.
Youre right, you are a tough guy. Youre the toughest palaeontologist I know.
Joey  All right, come on look, Ross can take care of himself! Its not like
hesChandler!
Chandler  (from his bedroom) Thanks!
Ross  Look, dont worry about me. Okay? Ill just stay real energetic
and stay away from the ball. Ill uh, Ill be that guy right out of the circle.
(He points to a player who starts running and then gets viscously tackled from behind.)
All  Oh!
Rachel  Oh, well maybe there was a dog lookin at him.
[Scene  The park, everyone is warming up for the rugby game. Only Joey and Phoebe came
to support Ross.]
Joey  Ross-Ross-Ross-Ross! Stay away from that guy (Points), and that guy
(Points). And that oneDude! Theyre all huge!
Ross  They dont look any bigger than me!
Joey  Well, maybe thats because youre closer to you. So you look
bigger to you from where you are.
Emily  Im just going to say hi to the lads. All right?
Ross  All right.
Emily  Okay. (Goes to say hi to the lads.)
Phoebe  (to the player) Hi.
Phoebe  Whoa! (The player leaves and to Joey) I kinda liked it.
Ross  Okay, I know what I have to do. Ive got to go Red Ross. (Joey and
Phoebe dont know what hes talking about.) Yknow, Red Ross!
Joey  I totally dont know what youre talking about.
Ross  Come on! The time we were all waiting in line for Dances With Wolves and
that one guy cut in line in front of us and I just lost it?! Screamed at him! Turned all
red! Red Ross!!
Joey  No.
Ross  Youll see.
Emily  Liam, do me a favour. Tell the lads to go easy on Ross, its his
first time.
Liam  You dont say! (We see Ross who is hopping about with the ball and
spikes it in his face.)
Emily  (to Ross) Good luck, babe.
Liam  Ross! Ross! Come on! Get in here! (Ross gets pumped up.) Ross! Come on!
Liam  Ross, come on! Get in the bloody scrum! Ross, get in!
Ross  JOEY!!!!!!
[Scene  Chandler and Joey's erm, Monica and Rachels, Monica is going over some
plans as Rachel enters.]
Rachel  Youarenot going to believe it! Joshua came into work today,
and guess what happened?
Monica  He asked you out?!
Rachel  No. But I was showing him some cufflinks and I felt his pulse.
Monica  Saucy!
Rachel  (refers to the table) What are these?
Monica  Electrical plans for the building.
Rachel  Okay, okay, okay should I be scared?
Monica  I know that switch does something, okay? So-so I went down to city hall
and got these. All I had to do was pay $25 and wait in line for three hours.
Rachel  Wow! If only more people knew.
[Scene  The airport, the Yemen Express counter, Chandler is still trying to get rid of
Janice.]
Chandler  Yknow you, really didnt have to take me to the airport.
Janice  Oh please. Every moment is precious. Yknow? Besides, somebody had
to ride in that other taxi with the rest of your luggage, and your friends dont
really seem to care too much that youre leaving.
Chandler  Well, were really not that close. (Pause) Okay, so I guess this
is uh, good-bye then.
Janice  On no! No! Its not good-bye, Im not leaving until you get on
that plane.
Chandler  Okay. Then I guess its just, wait here then. (Hands her the sign
that says, Wait Here.") (To the ticket agent) Hi. I need one fake ticket to Yemen.
Ticket Counter Attendant  One ticket to Yemen?
Chandler  Oh no-no-no, no. No, no, no, I just, I just need a pretend ticket.
Ticket Counter Attendant  Im sorry sir, I dont understand.
Chandler  What would you give to a kid if he wanted a ticket to play with?
Ticket Counter Attendant  Are you travelling with a child?
Chandler  No. All right, yknow what, shes (Points to Janice) gonna
think that Im handing you a credit card, but what Im really gonna do is hand
you a library card.
Ticket Counter Attendant  Ah, sir a ticket to Yemen is $2,100 and we dont
take library cards.
Janice  Whats the matter? Is something wrong? Do you have to stay?
Chandler  (to the ticket agent) American Express?
[Scene  The rugby game, Ross is getting killed.]
Emily  I cant believe theyre doing that to him! I told them to go
easy on him!
Phoebe  No offence but, yknow sometimes its hard to understand you,
yknow with the accent, so
Emily  Thats just halftime, theres more of this.
Ross  Did you see me? I was pretty good, huh? That is one fun game!
Emily  Right.
Ross  (to Emily) Hey, could you do me a favour? Could you just grab me a bottle
of water?
Emily  Okay.
Ross  Thanks. (When shes gone he collapses into Joey.) I-I think Im
dying. I really do.
Phoebe  Oh, poor baby.
Ross  (to Phoebe) Tell my son that I love him. (Emily returns with the water.)
Excellent! Well, okay, I gotta have some more fun!
Emily  Ross, they are killing you out there!
Ross  (whines "No.") Thats not true!
Phoebe  Shes right! You have to stop!
Ross  What? No! No, Im not stopping. Im Red Ross!
Joey  Dude, if you go back out there, youre gonna be Dead Ross!
Ross  I dont care! I am not quitting! I insist on finishing this game!
Emily  All right, all right, if you insist on doing this, at least let me help
you.
Ross  No, God no! That is no place for a woman. Those guys will grab anything.
Emily  No. Thats not what Im saying. I just may know a few things
that might help you inflict some pain.
Ross  I like that.
Emily  Yeah? Listen closely, Devon has got a weak ankle.
Ross  Huh?
Emily  One swift kick and hell back off.
Ross  All right, bad ankle, got it!
Emily  And that big bloke with the beard, he has got a trick hip. Yeah. And uh,
and David over there, I heard he doesnt wear a cup.
Ross  Yeah? I can use that, trick hip, no cup, okay! Okay!
Emily  And uh, Liam, Liams got bad knees. You hit him right and hell
go down like a lamp.
Ross  But-but, Liams on my team.
Emily  I dont care! You just get him!
Ross  Im gonna go get him! Okay, I am going back in! (Squeals like a
madman.)
Joey  The Red Ross! Okay.
[Scene  Chandler and Joey's erm, Monica and Rachels, Monica is reading a book as
Rachel returns.]
Rachel  Hey!
Monica  Hi!
Rachel  (noticing a bunch of pictures around the door that werent there
originally.) What-what are-what are these?
Monica  Oh, just some pictures I made and hung up. I thought theyd
brighten up the place. They do dont you think?
Monica  No-no-no, no!
Monica  I know that theres no hole there, I just really liked that
picture.
Rachel  Oh my God! Look at this!
Monica  Okay, but there is a wire back there! I mean that switch is
connected to something!
Rachel  I dont care! The wires have come loose in your head!
Monica  I just thought that if I could follow the wire I could find out what it
did.
Rachel  And did you?!
Monica  No. It disappears back there behind that baseboard. For a minute there,
I thought it went downstairs.
Monica  But it didnt. Say hello to Mrs. Chatracus.
Rachel  Oh my God.
Mrs. Chatracus  Hello darling.
Rachel  Hello, Mrs. Chatracus.
[Scene  Central Perk, They are returning from the rugby game, Joey and Emily are
carrying Ross.]
Phoebe  Now, are you sure you dont want to go see a doctor?
Ross  Oh no! That-thatll just bring me down! This was great! I mean I-I-I
was great! This is a great day! Yknow what? Im buying everyone coffee. All
right? If someone would just grab my wallet, its in my pocket.
Joey  Yeah, sure.
Ross  No, not you. (Emily gets it.)
Joey  Uhh, look, your eyes still popping out a little, Im gonna go
get some ice.
Phoebe  Ooh, ice! I am so in the mood for ice! (They go and get the coffee and
the ice leaving Ross and Emily alone.)
Emily  You were amazing out there.
Ross  Oh, I kinda was, wasnt I?
Emily  Oh my God!
Ross  I made a man twice my size cry. I mean, I havent done that since I
was four and I washed my dads Porsche with rocks.
Emily  You really enjoyed yourself didnt you?
Ross  Please! Are you kidding? I-I hurt three huge men, I gave a guy a bloody
noseI mean I-Im not proud of it but, I really am. And its all because of
you, wonderful, amazing you.
Emily  I think youve got concussion.
Ross  No, no, Im serious. Thank you.
Emily  Youre welcome. (She hugs him tightly and he winces.) Im
sorry. Did I hurt you?
Ross  Its worth the pain. (She goes to hug him again.) Yknow what,
you know what? Its not.
[Scene  The airport, the flight to Yemen is being called.]
Ticket Counter Attendant  (on the P.A.) This is the final boarding call for
Flight 664 to Yemen.
Chandler  Well, I-I guess I gotta go.
Janice  Oh, my Bing-a-ling. Ill wait for you. Do you even know how long
youre going to be gone?
Chandler  Well, just until we find an energy source to replace fuel.
Janice  Oh. Well, Ill right you everyday. (Reading the address) 15 Yemen
Road, Yemen.
Chandler  Okay, good-bye. Good-bye.
Janice  Chandler?
Chandler  No!
Janice  Chandler!
Chandler  Janice! There you are! There you are! I had to have one last kiss, and
also-also you said that you were going to leave right after I got on the plane!
Janice  No! No! I wanna see you take-off.
Chandler  Well, I then guess Im going to Yemen! Im going to Yemen!
(To this old woman also going to Yemen.) When we get to Yemen, can I stay with you?
[Scene  Chandler and Joey's erm, Monica and Rachels, Monica has finally given up
on her search to find what the light switch does and is now flicking it on and off
aimlessly.]
Monica  All right. The super couldnt figure out what it did. A $200 an
hour electrician couldnt figure out what it did. Ive had seven pretty serious
shocks. I officially give up.
Rachel  Thank God.
Monica  I guess Joey was right, it does nothing.
Phoebe  See? Im doing it. I am totally doing it. (Suddenly it stops
working.) I lost it.

[Scene  Monica and Rachel's erm, Chandler and Joey's, Chandler, Monica, and Phoebe are
there. Phoebe is stressing out about something.]
Monica  What is it hon?
Phoebe  I-I cant find anything that I want to eat! Everything I eat makes
me nauseous! Im telling you, being pregnant is no piece of cakeooh! Cake!
(Chandler shrugs, and Phoebe grimaces.) No.
Monica  Aww, honey Im sorry.
Phoebe  God! Ooh! What is that smell? Its coming from the bathroom. Ooh!
(She goes to the bathroom.)
Chandler  Wow! Pregnancy does give you some weird cravings.
Joey  Yeah?
Phoebe  Its me. Its Phoebe. Listen theres something in here I
want to eat, what-what smells so good?
Joey  Is it the shampoo? Its guava.
Phoebe  (she smells his head) No!
Joey  Oh! Wait-wait! (Reaches inside the shower.) Is it my bologna sandwich?
Phoebe  Yes. Yes. Yes. I cant believe it! The baby wants bologna! Maybe he
wants me to eat meat? I cant eat meat!
Joey  Oh, wait-wait! (Reaches into the shower again.) Maybe its a pickle?!
[Scene  Central Perk, Chandler, Monica, Joey and Rachel are there. Rachel is writing
something on a pad, and then crumples it up and throws it on the floor.]
Chandler  What are you writing?
Rachel  Well, Joshuas coming in tomorrow and since I dont have the
guts to ask him out, Im going to sell him a coat and put this note in the pocket.
Chandler  Oh yeah? (He grabs the pad and starts reading it.) Joshua, give me a
call sometime, guys like you (Pause) never go out of stylewhat did you throw away?
Chandler  Hi guys!
All  Hey!
Joey  Hey, what have you guys been up too?
Ross  Oh, we went to see a collection of Victorian doorknobs and the
Cupert-Hewitt museum.
Chandler  Without me?!
Emily  My uncle dragged us there. But, it actually it turned out to be really
interesting.
Ross  Yeah.
Emily  They were so ornate and beautiful, I mean look at that! (Shows them a
doorknob she has.)
Monica  I dont know how museums work in England but, here, youre not
supposed to take stuff.
Emily  I uh, I got it from the gift shop. They have really lax security there.
(Chandler is shocked.) Its a joke. (They all laugh.)
Ross  Bye. (They kiss.)
Emily  Right, Ive got to be off, Ill see ya. Buh-bye then. (She
leaves.)
Joey  Wow! You guys seem to be having a good time.
Ross  Oh yeah, shes-shes amazing. And-and shes so much fun.
And! Yknow what? When Im with her, Im fun! I even signed up for
helicopter classes. (Chandler is shocked.) Shes leaving in two days, I dont
have to do it.
Monica  Oh no, two days, you must be bummed.
Ross  Yeah, shes got to go back to London. But you know what? Ive
been prepared for this from the start. We both knew we had two weeks together, and
thats it. Yknow.
Joey  Hey thats what all my relationships are like.
Chandler  Yes, but in Rosss case, they both know in two weeks
thats it.
Ross  Pheebs!
All  Hey!
Ross  (starts rubbing her belly) Hello! Hello!
Phoebe  (angered by the rubbing) Yes! I know! I know! Yeah! So the baby is
totally craving meat. This afternoon I tried tricking it, I made it a soy-burger to make
it think it was getting meat, yknow? And I got nauseous.
Chandler  Maybe thats because soy-burgers suck!
Phoebe  Being pregnant is tough on your tummy.
Joey  Hey, but at least you got that cool, pregnant lady glow.
Phoebe  Thats sweat. You throw up all morning, youll have that glow
too.
[Scene  Bloomingdales, Rachel is preparing to slip Joshua the note.]
Joshua  (coming in from a changing room) Okay!
Rachel  Oh, heres that trench-coat that you wanted.
Joshua  Oh great! (He tries on the coat.) Wow! Yeah, its comfortable.
Rachel  Yeah?
Joshua  Man, I could really flash somebody in this thing. (He goes to put his
hands in his pockets.)
Rachel  (stopping him) Oh no-no, no-no, they dont want you to put your
hands in the pockets until you are out of the store.
Joshua  Why not?!
Rachel  Well, thats because of a lot of(She imitates someone picking
their nose and placing the treasure found in the pockets.)
Joshua  Yknow, they ruin it for everybody.
Rachel  I know!
Joshua  Yknow, I wore that cashmere sweater on a date last night.
Rachel  Oh?
Joshua  Yeah, it was my first date since the uh, since the divorce.
Rachel  Well, congratulations, so do you love her?
Joshua  No, no, no, shes nice but, yknow, it just it made me realize
that Im just not, Im just not ready to be dating, yknow?
Rachel  Huh. Well, uh, thats uh, thats interesting. (She goes over
and retrieves her note.)
Joshua  (noticing her) Hey-whoa-hey-hey, what was that?
Rachel  Oh, its just an anti-theft device.
Joshua  Then uh, whats-whats this? (Shows her the real anti-theft
device.)
Rachel  You need that, you need that too cause obviously, a thief could
just tear this up. (Rips up the note.)
[Scene  Monica and Rachel's erm, Chandler and Joey's, Ross is writing on the Magna-Doodle
as Rachel enters.]
Rachel  Oops, sorry. Listen, we-we have to have a party tonight! Actually, we
have to have one in five minutes, so everybody cancel your plans.
Chandler  What are you talking about?
Joey  Yeah, what going on?
Rachel  We have to have a surprise Bon Voyage party for Emily. But its
actually for Joshua. (Starts handing out party hats.) Look, he said hes not ready to
date, so I had to invite him to a party if I wanted to see him outside of work, and now I
have the perfect opportunity to seduce him! (Hands Ross a party hat.)
Ross  Well, as much as Id like to meet Josh and warn him, Emily and I
arent going to be here. All right? I mean, shes going to come by first to say
good-bye, and then Ive got a whole special evening planned. So Im sorry, no
party.
Joey  Awwww!
Emily  (entering) Hello?
Rachel  Surprise!!!
Chandler and Joey 
Emily  No ones ever thrown me a surprise party before!
Rachel  Well, it was all Rosss idea.
Emily  Youre so sweet! And Im so surprised!
Ross  You really didnt know?
Chandler  Why are you in here if Joshua is all the way over there? (Points to
the living room.)
Rachel  Uhh, because Im trying to play hard to get. Oh, quick hes
looking over here, say something funny.
Chandler  Like what?
Joey  What-what-what is so funny?
Chandler  I said, "Like what?"
Joey  Now thats a thinker.
Rachel  Okay, yknow what, yknow what? This playing hard to get thing
is not working. Umm, hand-hand me those cherries. (Chandler does so.) Okay. Okay. (She
does a little sexy walk over to where Joshua is standing.) Hi!
Joshua  Hi!
Rachel  Care for a cherry?
Joshua  Oh, no thanks.
Rachel  No? Yknow, I can tie one of these into a knot using just my
tongue.
Joshua  You okay? (Rachel swallowed it whole and is not hacking like a heavy
smoker in the morning.) You all right? (Rachel walks away, coughing.)
Ross  (interrupting Monica and Emily) So we should probably get going soon.
Emily  Oh, but the partys only just getting started!
Ross  Yeah, but we-we have to be at the Four Seasons for drinks in 15
minutes and then yknow, then The Plaza for dinner.
Emily  So why did you plan a party at the same time?
Ross  No-no-no, no, umm, actually American surprise parties are-are-are very
short. Its usually, "Surprise!" And then, "Oh my God, Im so
surprisedgood-bye!"
Emily  But Ross, Im such having a great time! Your sister has just been
telling me that you used to dress up like little, old ladies and hold make-believe tea
parties.
Ross  Monica said that did she? (He squeezes Monicas knee really hardly
and Monica winces in pain.)
Phoebe  Ooh, yeah. Then what are you going to put on top of that?
Joey  A little salami.
Phoebe  Ooh yeah! Then umm, what goes on top of the salami?
Joey  Pastrami.
Phoebe  Oooh, yeah. Youre a genius.
Rachel  Oh, could somebody give me a hand with this zipper?
Joey  Yeah. (He goes over to her.)
Rachel  Up!
Monica  You changed?
Rachel  Yeah, I did. I needed my lucky dress.
Monica  And lucky means, more cleavage?
Chandler  Does for me.
Rachel  Ohh, God! Look at him, hes so cute. I wanna go over there, grab
him, and kiss him! How can I kiss him and not letting him know that I like him?
Joey  Oh! I know how you can get him, take off your bra.
Rachel  What?
Joey  There was a seen in Footloose...
Chandler  Flashdance.
Joey  Yeah-yeah, yeah, with that-that uh, plumber girl
Chandler  She was a welder.
Joey  What? Were you like in the movie, or Anyway, she takes off
her bra under her shirt and pulls it out the sleeve. Very sexy, and classy.
Monica  Or if you want to kiss him, umm, you could use mistletoe.
Rachel  Its not Christmas!
Monica  Or Spin the Bottle?
Rachel  Hes not 11!
Emily  (with her coat on, shes leaving with Ross) Thank you so much for
this. It was really so thoughtful of you.
Rachel  What? Youre leaving?!
Ross  Yes, we have something we have to get to.
Joshua  Uhh, yeah, I think Im going to take-off too.
Rachel  No! You guys cant leave yet! You have to stay, we-we got the whole
big thing planned!
Ross  What big thing?
Emily  Ill go.
All  Yay!
Joey  Welcome to America. (They both kiss.)
Monica  Two in a row! Youve got to use your tongues now! (They kiss
again.)
Rachel  Yay! Emily!
Chandler  What are the odds? What are the odds?
Ross  (stopping them) Okay, that-thats enough! Yknow, lets,
lets let someone else play.
Joey  If you didnt want to play, why did you come to the party?
Rachel  Okay, my turn!!
Phoebe  Oh my God!! The baby just kicked!
All  Ohh!
Rachel  Its okay! Its okay! It kicked once, itll kick again!
All  Oh my God!
Rachel  All right, well, everybody just remember where they were sitting.
Rachel  Just a bug.
[Scene  Monica and Rachel's erm, Chandler and Joey's, it is later in the party. The
Spin the Bottle game is over and Chandler is making a sandwich as Phoebe watches.]
Phoebe  Yknow it doesnt matter how much Im craving it.
Yknow why Im never gonna eat meat? Because its murder, cold blooded
murder.
Chandler  Okay.
Chandler  Theres a Phoebe on my sandwich! (He walks away, giving the
sandwich to Phoebe.)
Joey  Phoebe, what-what are you doing?!
Phoebe  I cant help it. I need the meat. The baby needs the meat.
Joey  All right look, yknow how-yknow how when youre dating
someone and you dont want to cheat on them, unless its with someone really
hot?
Phoebe  Yeah, totally!
Joey  All right. Okay. Well this is the same kind of deal. If youre going
to do something wrong, (He grabs two steaks from the freezer) do it right!
Joey  Feel better now?
Phoebe  Yeah, but at what cost? Six more months, three meals a day, Im
gonna eat like, yknow millions of cows.
Joey  Hey, what if I said, I could even things out for ya, meatwise.
Phoebe  What?
Joey  Well, I eat a lot of meat right?
Phoebe  Yeah.
Joey  Well, suppose until the babys born I laid off it. No extra animals
would die, you-youd just be eating my animals.
Phoebe  Joey, I cant believe you would do that for me.
Joey  Absolutely! I could be a vegetarian. Theres no meat in beer, right?
Ross  Okay, we could still make dinner if we skipped the appetisers and asked
for our check right away.
Emily  But, we cant go now. It looks like Rachels gonna put on a
skit.
Monica  Oh my God! Have you lost your mind?
Rachel  No-n-n-n-no! I am finally thinking clearly. My lucky dress
wasnt working out to well for me, but for four years, this baby never missed.
Monica  Rachel-Rachel-Rachel I-I cannot, I cant let(pause), actually
I kinda want to see what happens.
Joshua  Hey!
Rachel  Hi!
Joshua  Nice uh, costume.
Rachel  Ohh, yeah, well I wanted to give Emily a big American good-bye
cheer. So okay! (Runs into the living room) Ready! Okay! Gimme an E!
All  E!
Rachel  Gimme an M!
All  M!
Rachel  Gimme an I!
All  I!
Rachel  Gimme an L!
All  L!
Rachel  Gimme a Y!
All  Y!
Rachel  What do you get? (She throws her pom-poms to Joey and Phoebe and
performs a cartwheel.) Emily!! (Tries to do another one.) EmilWhoa!! (She falls in
Chandlers room.) Okay! So thats me as a cheerleader! Ta-dum! (Gunthers
the only one that claps.)
Joey and Monica 
Rachel  Im fine! Im fine! Im just losing a tooth, its no
big deal. I have a dentist! Yknow. Im gonna go put some ice on it. Excuse me.
(She goes over to the ice and Joey and Monica follow her.) What do I do now? What do I do
now?
Monica  I think youre done.
Joey  Okay, time to take off the bra. (She glares at him.)
Joshua  Umm, that was really great, but I-I gotta take-off actually.
Joey  (trying not to be obvious) Take the bra off.
Rachel  All right, come on, lets go get your coat.
Joshua  Okay.
Gunther  Rachel is my girlfriend.
Joshua  So, this was uh, really fun.
Rachel  Oh, yeah! Real fun. (She makes a decision.) Yknow, this bra
Really, bothers me. (She starts taking off her bra.) Yknow, this used to be my
bedroom. Yeah. A lot of memories in here, a lot of memories. If these walls could
talk, yknow what theyd say? Wanna hear some memories? (She is now violently
pulling on her bra in order to remove it, but it isnt co-operating.)
Joshua  Need uh, need a little hand there.
Rachel  Oh no-no-no! No, I got this all under control.
Joshua  You really dont seem like you do. Thats
Rachel  Ughhhh!! Forget it! (Sits down heavily on the bed.) This is, this is not
how this is supposed to happen.
Joshua  Well, what was supposed to happen?
Rachel  Can you not look at me when I say this? (He turns around) I thought that
if I could get you here, I could seduce you.
Joshua  Huh. Oh, boy! (Sits down next to her.) Uhh, I-I dont wear suits to
work, and I bought six of them from you.
Rachel  Well, Im sorry, I thought you needed them!
Joshua  No, no-no, no-no, my point is that I kept coming back because, I wanted
to see you.
Rachel  Why?!
Joshua  Because I-I like you.
Rachel  You like me?
Joshua  Yeah! I mean youre-youre beautiful and smart and
sophisticateda lot of this isnt based on tonight.
Rachel  Yeah but-but-but you liked me! Oh my God, I cant believe this, all
this time, I liked you and you liked me!
Joshua  But
Rachel  Oh no-no-no dont say but! No-no, buts never good! Lets
just leave it at, you like me and I like you.
Joshua  Okay uh, however
Rachel  Oh, now see thats a fancy but.
Joshua  My marriage like just ended, and Im really not ready to get
into anything yet.
Rachel  But.
Joshua  Im sorry, I, I just need a little time.
Rachel  Okay.
[Scene  The hallway, Ross is sitting on the step drinking a beer as Rachel comes out of
the guys apartment.]
Rachel  Ohh, here you are. I was looking for you before. Joshuas gone so
you and Emily are free to go.
Ross  Thats okay. Shes still in there enjoying her fake party and
uh, its too late to do any of the things I had planned, so
Rachel  Oh, Ross, Im sorry. I completely ruined your evening.
Ross  Yeah.
Rachel  Well, if it makes you feel any better, I made a fool out of myself.
Ross  Helps a little.
Rachel  Is there room on that step for a pathetic loser?
Ross  Yeah, have a seat.
Rachel  Im so sorry.
Ross  Thats okay, I mean it was just two-week thing anyway, I just
didnt want it to end this way, yknow?
Rachel  Well, maybe you didnt want it to end?
Ross  What do you mean?
Rachel  You seem to really like her.
Ross  Yeah, I really do. Yeah, but what am I gonna do, I mean we-we both agreed
that it was gonna be a two-week thing, yknow no commitment.
Rachel  Ross, that girl just spent the entire evening talking to your friends,
asking to hear stories about you, looking through Monicas photo albums, I mean you
dont do that if youre just in it for two weeks.
Ross  You think?
Rachel  Yeah, you got like 14 hours until she has to be at the airport, and
youre sitting here in the hallway with a 28-year-old cheerleader with a fat lip.
Ross  Hey, youre right.
Rachel  Yeah.
Ross  Thanks. (He starts to go inside and stops.) What photo album was it?
Rachel  I dont know, it was you and a bunch of albino kids.
Ross  Oh my God! Those werent albino kids, that was computer camp! Rach!
(He hurries inside and Chandler is taking out the garbage.)
Rachel  Hey.
Chandler  Hey.
Rachel  Youre a pathetic loser, right?
Chandler  Oh-ho, yeah!
Rachel  Sit!
Joshua  Hi. (He has just returned.)
Rachel  Oh my gosh, Joshua!
Joshua  All those things I said about not being ready
Rachel  Theyre not true?
Joshua  No, theyre-theyre all true.
Rachel  Oh.
Joshua  But
Rachel  Oh! Oh, I love that but.
Rachel  You wanna go inside and have some coffee?
Joshua  Yeah.
Rachel  Okay. (Joshua goes inside and to Chandler.) Every time.
[Scene  Monica and Rachel's erm, Chandler and Joey's, the next day. Phoebe is busy
making a sandwich.]
Joey  Oooh, what you got there?
Phoebe  Pastrami.
Joey  Oh-ho-ho, yeah! Hey! Yknow what goes good with that?
Phoebe  Hm-mm, corn beef.
Joey  Ooh, I was gonna say bologna, but thats much better. How about a
little of that smoked turkey?
Phoebe  Okay.
Joey  (He starts looking longingly at the sandwich.) Oh mama! Uh when-when is
the baby due?
Phoebe  Six months.
Joey  Ugh. Now if a cow should die of natural causes, I can have one of those
right?
Phoebe  Not if I get there first.

hear Mr. Treeger in the bathroom.]
Mr. Treeger  Ohhh, man!!
Joey  (coming in from his bedroom) What is that?
Chandler  Treegers snaking the shower drain.
Mr. Treeger  What in the name of hell?
Joey  Maybe he found you flip-flop.
Chandler  Hey!
Joey  Whoa! Is this porn? What did I do? I mustve hit something on the
remote.
Chandler  Do we pay for this?
Joey  No, we didnt even pay our cable billmaybe this is how they
punish us.
Chandler  Maybe we shouldnt pay our phone billfree phone sex.
Joey  Maybe we shouldnt pay our gas bill? (Stops and thinks about what he
just said.)
Mr. Treeger  (coming in from the bathroom) Whoa, hey, that ladys all kinds
of naked.
Chandler  Yeah, Joey just pressed something on the remote and it just, came on!
Mr. Treeger  Yeah, it happened to me once. I was just flipping through the
channels and bam! It was like finding money.
Chandler  Like finding money with naked people on it!
Mr. Treeger  Then I made the mistake of turning off the TV, I never got it back
again. And Im sad. (Exits.)
Joey  (to Chandler) Why would he turn off the TV? (Chandler shrugs.)
[Scene  Monica and Rachel's erm, Chandler and Joey's, later that morning. The porn is
still on, there are three women getting ready to shave the chest of some guy. Joey and
Chandler are wondering why that guy is letting them shave his chest, and Monica and Rachel
are eating breakfast at the foosball table.]
Rachel  All right, yknow what, come on, do we really have to watch this
while we eat? (She makes a move for the remote.)
Joey and Chandler 
Chandler  We dont know what could make this go away.
Joey  Yeah, so no one touches the remote. And no one touches the TV!
Chandler  And no one touches the air around the TV!
Joey  Imagine a protective porn bubble if you will, okay?
Monica  Well at least, Im going to mute it.
Joey and Chandler 
Chandler  We still have porn.
Joey  Hey.
Phoebe  (entering, carrying her massage table) Hi!
Monica  Hi!
Rachel  Honey, what are you doing? Thats too heavy.
Phoebe  Yeah.
Rachel  Give it here. (She takes the table.) Oh, God. (And gives it to Monica
right away.)
Monica  Okay.
Phoebe  Ohh, Im getting too pregnant for this, lugging around a stupid
massage table. Yknow, I have to find a job where I carrying a smaller table. (She
goes over and stands in front of the TV.)
Chandler  Or a job where you dont have to carry a table.
Phoebe  You mean like a doctor?
Joey  Pheebs! Youre blocking the porn! Look out!
Phoebe  Ohh! (She moves.) Oh my. Oh, that reminds me, I have to see my OB-GYN
today.
[Scene  Chandler and Joey's erm, Monica and Rachel's, Ross is entering.]
Ross  Hi.
Monica  Hi.
Ross  So uh, Emily just went to the airport.
Monica  Oh. Why didnt you take her?
Ross  Eh, her-her uncle already had planned on doing it. And yknow, we-we
said our good-byes this morning, so
Monica  You must feel horrible. Hey! The guys have free porn!
Ross  (Thinks about it.) Nah.
Monica  Hey, cheer up! Youre gonna see her again, right?
Ross  Well I, thats the thing, I dont know! I mean, whenever I
brought it up with her she said, (In a British accent.) "This is so fantastic! Why do
we have to talk about the future? Lets just enjoy"
Monica  (interrupting him) No-no-no, dont-dont do the accent.
Youve got to see her again.
Ross  And why do you care so much?
Monica  Because! You could get to live out my fantasy!
Ross  You had fantasies about Emily?
Monica  No! Yknow, the fantasy! Meet someone from a strange land,
fall in madly love, and spend the rest of your lives together.
Ross  Is that why in junior high you were the only one that hung out with that
Ukrainian kid?
Monica  Yeah that, plus his mom used to put sour cream on everything!
Ross  Ahh.
Monica  Do you love her?
Ross  We said it was only going to be two weeks, yknow?
Monica  You love her!
Ross  What-what is love really?
Monica  Ohhh, I knew you loved her! Then you need to go to the airport
and tell her. Youre probably just gonna catch her just as shes about to go to
the gate. Youre gonna call out her name and say, "I love you!" And
shes gonna say, "I love you, too!" And you guys are going to have the most
amazing kiss, everyone at the gate will applaud.
Ross  I am a good kisser.
Monica  Then you two can, can sneak into the cockpit, and things will start to
heat up, and then a stewardess comes in (Ross looks at her.) Ive been watching
too much porn.
[Scene  Beth Israel Medical Center, Phoebe is at her OB-GYN doing an ultrasound, Rachel
is with her. We here the babys heartbeat.]
Rachel  Is that the heartbeat?
The Doctor  Thats it.
Phoebe  Oh my God!
Rachel  Oh wow! This is so cool.
The Doctor  Have we talked about the possibility of multiple births?
Phoebe  Why dont take care of this one, and should I get pregnant again,
Ill hold onto your card, okay?
The Doctor  No, Im getting three separate heartbeats.
Phoebe  Three? You guys were worried I wouldnt even have one!
The Doctor  Doctors are wrong all the time.
Phoebe  Well, yeah.
Rachel  Well, so, are-are you sure that there are three?!
The Doctor  Definitely. (Points out each head on the ultrasound.)
Phoebe  Oh my God! Oh my God! Oh my God!! So I-I mean so in a few months
Im going to have three full grown babies just walkin around inside me?! Oh!
Oh! And its gonna be one of those log rides where they just come shooting out!
The Doctor  Actually, giving birth to three babies isnt that different
from giving birth to one.
Phoebe  What do you know?!
[Scene  Central Perk, Phoebe is there, waiting to tell Frank and Alice the news.]
Alice  (entering) Oh-oh, Phoebe!
Phoebe  Ooh! Hi!
Alice  Hi! (She runs over and hugs Phoebes stomach.) So, how did it go at
the doctors?
Phoebe  Oh well, okay, hey, yknow how when youre umm, youre
walking down the street and you see three people in a row, and you say, "Oh,
thats nice?"
Frank  Yes.
Phoebe  Okay, yeah well, good news, youre going to have three babies.
Alice  Three babies?
Frank  I finally got my band!
Alice  Were gonna have a big family, Ive always wanted a big family!
Phoebe  Oh God, Im so glad you guys are happy, I was so afraid you were
going to be all freaked.
Frank  Why would we be freaked?
Phoebe  No, no maybe cause its harder to raise them, and the added
expense, and
Frank  (Theyre less than happy now) Oh.
Alice  Right.
Phoebe  No, back to happy. Back to happy!
Alice  No-no-no, no, its going to be fine. Because umm, because I teach
Home Ec, and uh, I can have 30 kids making baby clothes all year long. Yknow
itll-itll be like my very own little sweatshop.
Frank  Yeah, Ive been thinking ever since you said we were having
triplets, the best thing for me to do is to drop out of college and get a job.
Alice  No, Frank.
Phoebe  No you cant quit college! No! Youre in college? Really?
Frank  Yeah, refrigerator college.
Alice  Yeah.
Frank  Yeah, yknow when we found out we were going to have a baby,
yknow I figured yknow like I should yknow have like a careerand I
love refrigerators!
Phoebe  You cant give up on your dream.
Frank  No, its okay. Were-were gonna have three kids! And
thats-thats a different kind of dream. Three kids and no money.
[Scene  The airport, Emily is getting ready to board her flight to London.]
Ticket Agent 
Ross  Emily! (Runs up.)
Emily  Oh my God! What are you doing here? (They hug)
Ross  I just, I had to see you one more time before you took-off.
Emily  You are so sweet. (They kiss.)
Ross  Thats, thats, thats a big candy bar. (Shes holding
one of those huge Toblerone bars.) I had the most amazing time with you.
Emily  Me too.
Ticket Agent 
Emily  Well, that me. (They kiss again.) Here, have this. (She gives him
the candy bar.) Im only allowed one piece of carryon anyway. (She starts towards the
jetway.)
Ross  (stops her) Wait uh, listen. I-I, I have to tell you something. Umm,
Ive been thinking, Im just gonna come out and say it. Okay? I-I-I ah, I-I
think I love you.
Emily  Oh. (Shes shocked and hugs him.) Thank you. (She boards the plane.)
Ross  Thats no problem.
[Scene  Monica and Rachel's erm, Chandler and Joey's, Rachel is singing some kind of
song.]
Rachel  Whats that song? It has been in my head all day long.
Chandler  Its the theme from Good Will Humping.
Rachel  Yknow who doesnt even like dirty movies? My new boyfriend
Joshua.
Joey  Yeah right.
Rachel  No, he told me. He prefers to leave certain things to the imagination.
Chandler  Oh-oh, yeah, and did he also say that ah, some of the dialogue was
corny and that he actually found it was funny and not sexy?
Rachel  Yes!
Joey  Yeah, he likes porn.
Monica  Where ya going?
Rachel  Im going to find out if he really thinks supermodels are too
skinny. (As she exits, Phoebe enters.) Hey, Pheebs!
Phoebe  Hey.
Joey  Hey!
Monica  How did it go with Frank and Alice?
Phoebe  Well, Frank has to quit college because his super fertile sister is
having three babies! I need to make a lot of money really fast, and I had an idea that I
want to talk to you (Points to Chandler) about, cause you work for a big company.
Okay, insider trading, what information is there that you can give me.
Chandler  They dont really talk to us about that kind of stuff. I can get
you some free white out though.
Monica  Ohh! Did you do what I said? Did-did-did you tell her?
Ross  I did.
Monica  And well, what did she say?
Ross  Thank you.
Monica  Oh, youre totally welcome! Whatd she say?
Ross  She said, "Thank you." I said, "I love you." And she
said, "Thank you."
Chandler  Whoa-whoa, wait a minute, did you say, you love her?
Joey  Yeah, what were you trying to get her to do?!
Ross  What do I do now?
Joey  You play hard to get.
Ross  She already lives in London.
Joey  Then you go to Tokyo.
Chandler  All right look, forget it, forget it. You told her you love her,
its over.
Monica  It is not over! Youre over!
Chandler  What?
Monica  You know!
Chandler  Okay. (Pause) Good one.
Monica  It is not over because she is going to call you and tell you she loves
you. And the reason why she couldnt, is because her feelings were so strong, it
scared her. Now you go home and wait for her call, she could be calling you from the
plane! Come on now go! Go! (Tries to push Ross out the door.)
Ross  Okay! Okay! But if she doesnt call, it is definitely over! No, wait.
Wait. Unless, eventually, I call her, yknow just to she whats going on, and,
and she says shell call me back, but then she doesnt. Then its
over.
Joey  Way to be strong, man!
[Scene  Chandler and Joey's erm, Monica and Rachel's, Chandler and Joey enter having
just woken up.]
Rachel  Hey!
Chandler  Hi! Listen, can we watch cartoons on your television? We need a porn
break. We spent the last two hours watching In & Out & In, Again.
Rachel  Well, so, why dont you just turn it off?
Chandler  Because then we would be the guys who turned off free porn.
Phoebe  (entering carrying a case) Ooh, good, youre hear! Okay.
Monica  Hey!
Phoebe  Hi!
Rachel  Well, what-what cha got there?
Phoebe  Oh this, well Im glad you asked. (She opens the case and removes a
knife and an soda can.) Now, dont you hate it when you have to cut a tin can with an
ordinary steak knife? (She efficiently cuts it in half.) Ahh! Now, I know what youre
thinking
Chandler  Pregnant Woman Slays Four?
Monica  Phoebe, they didnt make you pay for those knives, did they?
Phoebe  No!
Monica  Are you sure?
Phoebe  No!
Rachel  Honey, youre not gonna make enough money to help Frank and Alice
just by selling knives.
Phoebe  No-no, I know that, but I just have to make enough money for the second
part of my plan.
Chandler  Whats the second part of your plan?
Phoebe  My Saturn dealership.
[Scene  Rosss bedroom, he has fallen asleep waiting for Emily to call. He is
awaken by the phone.]
Ross  (Answers the phone.) Hello?
Emily  Ross.
Ross  Emily, hi! Uh, how-how was you flight?
Emily  It was dreadful. I felt terrible about how I acted when you said those
wonderful things.
Ross  No, no, that-that, thats all right. Umm, Im just glad you
called.
Emily  Ross umm, theres something that Ive got to tell you,
theres-theres someone else.
Ross  Does that mean the same thing in England as it does in America?
[Scene  Monica and Rachel's erm, Chandler and Joey's, Ross is relating his recent
conversation with Emily to the gang.]
Ross  She doesnt know which one of us she wants, me or this Colin guy.
Monica  This isnt how its supposed to go, there cant be
another guy.
Ross  Well
Monica  Of course theres another guy!! This is even more perfect! Now you
have to prove your love!
Ross  Im not proving anything. Okay, Im done listening to you. If I
hadnt let you talk me into going to the airport in the first place, I never
wouldve put my fist through the wall!
Chandler  You put your fist through the wall?
Ross  No, I missed and hit the door. But, it opened really hard!
Monica  You have to go to London!
Ross  What?
Monica  Yeah, you have to go fight for her!
Joey  Oh yeah, sure, that makes sense. Yeah. Cause you already told her
you love her and she didnt say it back, then she called you and told you that
theres another guy, so yeah, go to London thatll scare her!
Monica  When Rachel was with Paulo, what did you do?
Ross  I made fun of his accent.
Monica  You sat back and let him have her, you didnt fight at all. Am I
right? Do you want the same thing to happen with Emily?
Ross  No.
Monica  All right then, go fight for her! Go to London! I mean, that could be
you and Emily! (Points to the TV.) That, but-but nicer. Just, go to London!
Ross  Really?
Monica  Come on! Surprise her! Show up at her doorstep! Dont let her go
without a fight!
Ross  All right. All right, Im gonna do it!
Monica  All right.
Ross  Im gonna, Im gonna go to London and Im going to fight
for her.
Monica  Okay, good luck!
Joey  Ross! Ross! If youre going to the airport, could you pick me up
another one of those Toblerone bars? (Chandler nods his head no.)
[Scene  Chandler and Joey's erm, Monica and Rachel's, Monica, Joey, and Chandler are
sitting and talking as Phoebe and Rachel enter.]
Rachel  Hey!
Phoebe  Ooh-Ooh! I did it! I did it! I figured out a way to make money! Im
gonna open up my own massage place and Franks gonna help me! And! We can work it
around his schedule so he doesnt have to quit school!
Monica  Thats sounds great, but how are you going to afford it?
Rachel  Well, we were walking down the street and we saw that van that you guys
used for catering and we realised
Phoebe  Im telling it! Im telling it!
Rachel  Okay.
Phoebe  Okay. You know how people need transportation, but they also need
massages to help them relax so I just figured we could combine the two, okay, I give the
massages and Frank drives! I can fix up the van, bolt the table in the back, and you know
what Ive got?
Chandler  A place where no one will ever get out alive?
Phoebe  No! Think about it, its a taxi that people take when they need to
relax, its
Rachel  (interrupting) Relaxi-Taxi!
Phoebe  The name was my favourite part!
Rachel  Well, well I can up with it!
Phoebe  YOU DID NOT!!!! Oh! No! You came up with Relaxi Cab! Thats
not good.
Rachel  Well, I
Monica  Hello.
Ross  (on phone) Hey.
Monica  Oh my God! Ross, are you in England? Was Emily surprised?
Ross  No, because she hasnt come home yet. And she hasnt been home
all night! Shes obviously staying with that other guy, and Im the stupid moron
who spent the whole night outside her apartment!
Monica  All right. When is, when is the next flight out?
Ross  About four hours.
Monica  Okay, just stay there a couple more hours and if she doesnt show
up by then, then just come on home.
Phoebe  Hey, tell him about Relaxi-Taxi, and-and ask him if he thinks
thats better than Relaxi Cab.
Rachel  Okay, its not Relaxi Cab. Its Relaxicab, like taxicab.
Phoebe  Oh, that is better.
[Scene  Monica and Rachel's erm, Chandler and Joey's, later that same night. There is a
knock on the door and Chandler answers it to reveal Emily standing behind it.]
Chandler  Are we in London?
Monica  What are you doing here? You cant be here!
Emily  Ive uh, Ive come to talk to Ross.
Emily  What?
Joey  (pause) Nothing. No, nothing.
Emily  I was going to call him, but
Monica  Oh, you came to tell him you love him! I knew it! (Points at Chandler) I
was right! (Points to Emily) Im right, right?
Emily  Id really rather talk to him.
Monica  Oh.
Emily  I uh, Ive been to his apartment and he wasnt there, and uh. I
need to talk to him, so do you have any idea where he is?
Emily  Ross, are you there? Ross, I dont know if you can hear this
but (Ross has moved to the window, apparently so that he can hear better.) Im
gonna talk anyway, uh, Im in the States with you sister and your friends and
its all over with Colin. I came here to tell you that, and to tell youYes,
Joey you can have all the chocolate you want, just take it! Uh, I came here to tell you
that I love you.
Ross  (yelling, thinking Emily can hear him through the answering machine all
the way to New York.) I love you too! Im, Im gonna call you right now from the
phone booth! (Realises) You cant hear me. (Goes to make his call.)
Emily  I wish I could know if youd heard any of that. I suppose Ive
either just told you I love you or given my neighbours a good laugh. Mrs. Newman if
youre listening, bugger off this in none of your business. I suppose theres
not much chance you did heard that, and theres the call waiting so, I should go. Oh
well. (Answers the call waiting.) Hello.
Ross  Hi.
Emily  Ross, I love you!
Ross  Ohh! Thank you.
[Scene  Monica and Rachel's erm, Chandler and Joey's, Joey is still watching the porn
as Chandler enters.]
Chandler  Hey.
Joey  Hey.
Chandler  I was just at the bank, and there was this really hot teller, and she
didnt ask me to go do it with her in the vault.
Joey  Same kind of thing happened to me! Woman pizza delivery guy come over,
gives me the pizza, takes the money, and leaves!
Chandler  What, no, "Nice apartment, I bet the bedrooms are huge?"
Joey  Noo! Nothing!
Chandler  Yknow what, we have to turn off the porn.
Joey  I think youre right.
Chandler  All right, ready?
Joey  One.
Chandler  Two.
Both 
Joey  Thats kinda nice.
Chandler  Yeah, thats kinda a relief.
Joey  Yeah.
Chandler  You wanna see if we still have it?
Joey  Yeah.
Chandler  FREE PORN!!!
Joey  Yeah!!
Chandler  We have free porn here!!!

[Scene  Central Perk, Joey and Chandler are there as Phoebe enters carrying a drum.]
Phoebe  Hey!
Chandler  Hey! Wow, it is true what they say, pregnant bellies look like
a drum.
Phoebe  (not amused) Ha-ha. (She sits down on the couch.) No, its just
Im so pregnant that Imy guitar doesnt fit anymore. So I thought
til Im not, Im just gonna play all my songs on this drum. It sounds really
cool!
Chandler  All right.
Phoebe  Listen. Listen. (She starts to play and sing.) Smelly cat, smelly
cat, what are they feeding you?
Joey  Wow, Pheebs! That sounds great!
Phoebe  I know! I know, and Ive only been playing for like an hour!
Alice  (entering) Phoebe! Phoebe! Hi! Hi!
Phoebe  Hey! What are you doing here?
Alice  Umm, actually, I came down to ask you a big favour.
Phoebe  Oh, well, dont tell me you want to keep more of your stuff in my
uterus.
Alice  (laughs) No. No. No. (Sits down.) Okay, now, see, I wanna name the girl
baby Leslie, and Frank wants to name one of the boy babies Frank JR. JR.
Chandler  Wouldnt that be Frank the III?
Alice  Dont get me started. (To Phoebe) Anyway, umm, since there are three
babies and umm, we both got to put our names in, we would be truly honoured if you named
the other boy baby.
Phoebe  Wow! Thats so great! Oh! Oh! Cougar.
Alice  You think about it. (Leaves)
[Scene  Rosss apartment, he and Emily are getting ready to go to the airport.]
Emily  I left a bra drying on the shower rod, you dont think your son will
think its yours and be horribly traumatised?
Ross  Hey, if mommy can have a wife, daddy can have a bra.
Emily  (checks the clock) Ohh, its time to go.
Ross  Oh, no-no-no, see, that-that clocks a little fast, uh, we have 17
minutes. Huh, what can we do in 17 minutes? Twice?
Emily  Well thats ambitious.
Ross  Hey, uh, you can ignore that.
Emily  Thats Carol with your son!
Ross  Uhh, believe me when hes older, hell understand.
Carol  (knocking on the door) Ross!
Ross  Ill be right there. (He goes over and opens the door to Carol,
Susan, and Ben.) (To Ben.) Hello! (To Carol.) Hello! (To Susan.) Hey. Uhh, Emily, this is
Carol and Susan.
Susan  Hey, its so nice to finally meet you!
Emily  Me too!
Carol  Ohh, yknow, Susans gonna be shooting a commercial in London
next week.
Susan  Oh yeah, Im so excited, Ive never been there.
Emily  Oh, well, Ill show you around.
Susan  That would be great! Also, uh, I was hoping to catch a show so if you can
make any suggestions
Emily  Oh, theres tonnes of terrific stuffIll go with you!
Susan  Ahh!
Ross  Look at you two, bonding, making us late for the airport so
Emily  Are you all right?
Susan  Oh, hes fine. Hes fine. Its just that us getting along
is difficult for him, because he doesnt like me.
Ross  Oh come on! Thats-thats true.
[Scene  Monica and Rachel's erm, Chandler and Joey's, Joey and Chandler are playing
foosball as Phoebe enters.]
Phoebe  Hi!
Joey  Hey!
Chandler  Hey! Do we have a baby name yet?
Phoebe  Ugh! No! This is so hard! I went through this whole book (Holds up a
book) and found nothing! I want a name thats really like, yknow strong and
confident, yknow? Like-like Exxon.
Chandler  Well, it certainly worked for that Valdez kid.
Joey  Ooh-ooh, Pheebs, you want a strong name? How about, The Hulk?
Phoebe  No, Im-Im not sure about Hulk, but I like the idea of a name
starting with "The."
Joey  Oh, want a good name, go with Joey. Joeys your pal. Joeys your
buddy. "Where is everybody?" "Well, theyre hanging out with
Joey."
Chandler  Hey, yknow what, if youre gonna do that, if youre
gonna name him Joey, you should name him Chandler. (Phoebe doesnt think so.) Oh,
come on! Chandlers funny, sophisticated, and hes very loveable, once you get
to know him.
Joey  Oh well, hey, Joeys loveable too! But the thing about Joey is, if
you need him, hell be there.
Chandler  Well, Chandler will be there for you too. I mean, well, he might be a
little late, but-but, hell be there. And hell bring you some cold soda, if
want you need him for is that youre really hot.
Joey  What do ya say? What do ya say?
Phoebe  Well, I, I like the idea of naming him after someone I love, and Joey
and Chandler are great names. (They both stare at her.) But, all right, I
dontmaybe Ill just name him The Hulk.
Joey  I knew I shouldnt have mentioned it! Thats what I wanted to
name my kid!
[Scene  Chandler and Joey's erm, Monica and Rachel's, Monica is cooking and Rachel is
getting ready for a date with Joshua.]
Rachel  Hey, Mon, if you were hoping to sleep with Joshua the first time
tonight, which one of these would you want to be wearing. (Shes holding two frilly,
lace nighties.)
Monica  Yknow what? It really creeps me out choosing other
peoples sex clothes.
Rachel  Sorry. Im so exited! Ive been waiting for this for months! I
got my hair coloured! I got new sheets! Im making him a very fancy meal.
Monica  Um-hmm.
Rachel  What am I making him by the way?
Monica  Well, youre making him a frieze salad with goat cheese and pine
nuts, wild nuts, wild rice, roast asparagus, and salmon au croup.
Rachel  I thought I was making him filet mignon?
Monica  Yeah, you were, but you decided to make salmon because you had some left
over at the restaurant. And then you realised if you (Points at Rachel) bitched about it,
then you (Points to herself) would stop cooking, and you (Points at Rachel) would have to
make your famous baked potato and Diet Coke.
Rachel  Wow, I really get crabby when I cook.
[Scene  Monica and Rachel's erm, Chandler and Joey's, Joey, Chandler, and Phoebe are
there as Ross enters.]
Ross  Hey!
Joey  Hey!
Chandler  Hey!
Ross  So uh, Emily called last night
Chandler  And now youre giving me the message!
Ross  Turns out them Emily is just crazy about Susan. Yeah, theyre
going to the theatre together! Theyre going to dinner! Theyre going horseback
riding!
Phoebe  God, Susan is so fun!
Chandler  You actually think that something can happen between Emily and Susan?
Ross  Hey, theyre going to the gym together! Two women! Stretching!
Yknow they-they take a steam together! Things get a little playfuldidnt
you see Personal Best?
Joey  No, but Im gonna!
Chandler  Hi! Hi! Youre crazy! Okay? This is Emily. Emily is straight.
Ross  How do you know? I mean we thought Carol was straight before I married
her!
Phoebe  Yeah, I definitely. I dont like the name Ross.
Ross  What a weird way to kick me when Im down.
Phoebe  No! No! I-I meant for the baby!
Ross  Oh. Whats wrong with Ross?
Phoebe  Well, its just yknow that something like this would never to
like The Hulk, yknow
Ross  Actually that-thats not true, in The Incredible Hulk uh, No.
72, Dr. Bruce Banner found (Sees everyone staring at him and stops.) Yknow,
ugh, nevermind, my girlfriends a lesbian. (Leaves.)
Phoebe  So, I decided Im definitely going to go with either Joey or
Chandler.
Joey  Oh! Oh-oh, you gotta pick Joey! I mean, name one famous person named
Chandler.
Chandler  Raymond Chandler.
Joey  Someone you didnt make up!
Chandler  Okay, there are no famous Joeys. Except for, huh, Joey
Buttafucco.
Joey  Yeah, that guy really hurt us.
Phoebe  Well, how about a compromise then, okay? What if its like
yknow, Chanoey?
Chandler  Okay, look, Joey! Come on, think about it, first of all, hell
never be President. Theres never gonna be a President Joey.
Joey  All right look man, I didnt want to bring this up, but Chandler, is
the stupidest name I ever heard in my life! Its not even a name; its barely
even a word. Okay? Its kinda like chandelier, but its not! All right?
Its a stupid, stupid non-name!
Chandler  Wow, youre, youre right. I have a horrible, horrible name.
Joey  Im sorry man, I didntIm-Im sorry. Im
sorry. (Goes over and comforts him.)
Chandler  Okay.
Joey  So I guess its Joey then!
[Scene  Chandler and Joey's erm, Monica and Rachel's, Rachel is on her dinner date with
Joshua.]
Joshua  This is so nice. Thank you for doing this.
Rachel  Ohh, please! Cooking soothes me. (They kiss.) Ahh. So, dig in!
Joshua  Great! Oh, it all looks sooo good!
Rachel  (taking a bite) Hmmm!
Joshua  Oh my God!
Rachel  Oh I know, my God, this is sothis rice is soI am so good.
Joshua  Behind you?
Rachel  (sees the chick and the duck) Oh, yeah, Im sorry. They used to
live here; sometimes they migrate back over.
Joshua  (getting up and backing away from they.) Is there ah, is there some way
they can not be here. Its just ah, farm birds really kinda freak me out!
Rachel  Yeah, sure, okay. Okay.
Joey  (answering the door.) Hey, how did you do that?! Come on in. (He brings
them inside.)
Rachel  All gone! So, farm birds, huh?
Joshua  Yeah, its-its my only weird thing, I swear. And I-I-I
wouldve told you about it, but I didnt know they would be here.
Rachel  Oh.
Joshua  So, all right.
Rachel  Okay. So, can I serve you a little ofWhat? What? What? (She sees
that Joshua isnt relaxed.)
Joshua  Nothing I uh, its just that I know that theyre still out
there.
Rachel  But, theyre across the hall! I mean thats two doors away, it
would take them a long time to peck their way back over here.
Joshua  Okay, thats-thats not funny. Uhh.
Rachel  Okay, yknow, would you feel better if we went someplace else? I
mean we could pack all this stuff up and yknow go to your apartment.
Joshua  Oh, theyre working on this week, its a total mess. But uh,
Im staying at my parents house, we could go there.
Rachel  Your parents?
Joshua  Yeah, theyre out of town.
Rachel  Ohh.
Joshua  Yeah-yeah, its this huge place, and-and its got this
gorgeous view of the park, and very, very romantic. What do you say?
Rachel  Yeah that works.
Joshua  They-they-they can smell fear.
[Scene  Rosss apartment, Carol has come to pick up Ben.]
Ross  (opening the door.) Hey!
Carol  Hey! Hows Ben?
Ross  Well, I asked him if he wanted to eat, he said, "No." I asked
him if he wanted to sleep, he said, "No." I asked him what he wanted to do, he
said, "No." So, hes sweeping. (We see Ben playing with a broom and a
dustpan.)
Carol  Hey, Ben! Hey!
Ross  So umm, any word from Susan?
Carol  Ooh, yeah! She said shes having sooo much fun with Emily.
Ross  Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Uh, by the by, did it uh, did it ever occur to you that, I
dont know, maybe they might be having a little too much fun?
Carol  Whats too much fun?
Ross  Yknow, the kind of fun, you and Susan had when we were married.
Carol  Oh my God, you are so paranoid!
Ross  Am I?!
Carol  Yes!
Ross  Am I?!
Carol  I cant speak for Emily, but Susan is in a loving, committed
relationship.
Ross  Uh-huh, Carol, so were we. All right, just-just imagine for a moment,
Susan meets someone and-and they really hit it off. Yknow? Say-say theyre
coming back from the theatre, and they-they stop at a pub for a couple of drinks,
theyre laughing, yknow, someone innocently touches someone else
Theres electricity, its new. Its exciting. Are you telling me there
isnt even the slightest possibility of something happening?
Carol  Maybe.
Ross  OH MY GOD!! I didnt really believe it until you just said it!!
[Scene  Joshuas parents apartment, Rachel and Joshua are entering.]
Joshua  and even though none of the other kids believed me, I swear to
God, that duck pushed me!
Rachel  Wow! This place is fabulous!
Joshua  Yeah, yeah, let me show you around. This is the uh, downstairs living
room.
Rachel  Whoa-whoa, theres two living rooms? God, growing up here, this
place mustve been a real babe magnet.
Joshua  Yeah, well, it wouldve been, but uh, my parents just moved here.
Rachel  Ohh, you should know, this place is a real babe magnet. Wanna make out?
Joshua  Hey, heres an idea. Why dont uh, I put the food in the
fridge and we can eat it later?
Rachel  That sounds like a plan. Umm, is there a place I can go freshen up?
Joshua  Oh yeah, yeah uh, its down the hall and uh, second door to your
left.
Rachel  Ah.
Mrs. Burgin  Oh, hi, darling!
Joshua  Mom, Dad, what are you guys doing here?
Mrs. Burgin  Oh, well we cut the trip short.
Mr. Burgin  France sucks!
Joshua  Umm, this may be a little weird, but I-I-I got a date here.
Mrs. Burgin  Oh, say no more!
Mr. Burgin  Well just grab some food and take it with us right upstairs,
and well be right out of you hair.
Joshua  Oh, that-that would be great. So you didnt even get to Italy?
Mr. Burgin  Yep, sucks!
Rachel  Hi you!
Joshua  Oh my God!
Rachel  I know, I can do more than cook.
Mr. Burgin  I like her. She sees smart.
[Scene  Joshuas parents apartment, continued from earlier.]
Joshua  Uhh, Rachel, my parents
Rachel  Ohh! Its so nice to meet you. (She goes over and shakes their
hands.) Hello.
Mr. Burgin  Hi.
Rachel  Hello.
Mrs. Burgin  Hello. Well, Joshua, that $500 was for groceries.
Rachel  What? This-this, no, oh no, no-no-no, this is
notthats-thats not what it is. See, see, okay, I work in fashion, see
and-and, this is a real dress actually. Its-its, theyre-theyre
wearing it in Milan, so part of my job is too wear the clothes, and then I see how people
respond, and then I report back to my superiors at Bloomingdales, so
And obviously in uh, in-in this case, (She grabs a pen and paper) I am going to report
back, "USA not ready."
Mrs. Burgin  Maybe in L.A?
Rachel  Yes!
Joshua  There you go.
Mr. Burgin  So, have you kids eaten yet?
Rachel  Well, we were going to do that afterI mean umm, next.
Mr. Burgin  Well, were starving, why dont we all go get something to
eat?
Rachel  Oh, yeah, well Yeah, no use wasting this baby, just lyin
around the house.
Mr. Burgin  So We go eat.
Rachel  Yes.
Mr. Burgin  Youll wear that. Well be eating, and of course,
youll be wearing that.
[Scene  Monica and Rachel's erm, Chandler and Joey's, Chandler is looking for a new
name in Phoebes book of names.]
Joey  Dude, I am sorry about what I said!
Chandler  No, no, youre right, it is a ridiculous name!
Joey  Its not that bad.
Chandler  Yes it is! From now on, I have no first name.
Joey  So, youre just Bing?
Chandler  I have no name.
Phoebe  All right, so, what are we supposed to call you?
Chandler  Okay uh, for now, temporarily, you can call me, Clint.
Joey  No way are you cool enough to pull of Clint.
Chandler  Okay, so what name am I cool enough to pull off?
Phoebe  Umm, Gene.
Chandler  Its Clint. Its Clint! (He heads for his bedroom.)
Joey  See you later, Gene.
Phoebe  Bye, Gene.
Chandler  Its Clint! Clint!
Joey  Whats up with Gene?
[Scene  Central Perk, Rachel is telling Phoebe and Monica of her date.]
Monica  So, you wore your nightie to dinner?
Rachel  Oh, yeah. And uh, the best part though, when the uh, waiter spilled
water down my back, I jumped up, and my boob popped out.
Phoebe  Oh my God!
Monica  Oh, no!
Rachel  No, its all right. I got nice boobs. (Phoebe and Monica nod there
heads in agreement.)
Ross  (returning from the phone.) So, I just picked up a message from Emily, she
and Susan are going to a poetry reading together!
Rachel  So?
Ross  So! Poetry? Susans gay! Theyre being gay together!
Monica  Emilys straight.
Ross  Oh, wake up!
Phoebe  Wow, Carol really messed you up!
Ross  Excuse me?
Phoebe  Yeah, she turned you into this-this-this untrusting, crazy, jealous,
sycophant. (They all look at her.) All right, so I dont know what sycophant means,
but the rest is right.
Ross  Look, I dont know what youre talking about, I am not a crazy,
jealous person.
Rachel  Huh.
Ross  What?
Rachel  Shes totally right! When we were together, you got all freaked out
about Mark and there was nothing going on.
Monica  This totally makes sense!
Ross  It does not!
Monica  Oh, sure it does! In high school, you werent jealous at all even
though all your girlfriends were cheating on you!
Phoebe  All right, all right, so up until 92-93 he was very trusting, then
94 hit, Carol left him and bamn! Paranoid city!
Rachel  Absolutely! Absolutely!
Monica  This is so much fun!
Ross  This is not fun!
Monica  Look, all were trying to say is, dont let what happened with
Carol ruin what you got with Emily.
Phoebe  Yeah. The 92 Ross wouldnt.
Ross  Well, I still think I was right about that whole Mark thing.
Rachel  Whatyeahwhat, yknow what? I hope Emily is a
lesbian.
[Scene  Monica and Rachel's erm, Chandler and Joey's, Phoebe is showing off more of her
drum skills to Joey by rubbing one of the sticks back and forth across the drum.]
Phoebe  Drum roll.
Chandler  (entering) Okay. Okay. All right. Help! Am I a Mark, or a John?
Joey  Nah, youre not tall enough to be a Mark, but you might make a good
Barney.
Phoebe  Youre actually going through with this?
Chandler  Hey, look, this name has been holding me back my entire life. Okay,
its probably why kids picked on me in school, and why I never do well with
women So, as of 4 oclock tomorrow, Im either gonna be Mark Johnson or
John Markson.
Phoebe  You got problems because of you! Not your name! All right, this has got
to stop! Chandler is a great name! In factyes, (To Joey) Im, Im sorry. I
know you really wanted me to name the baby Joey, but eh, so, Im-Im, Im
gonna, Im gonna name the baby Chandler.
Chandler  (pleased) Really?!
Phoebe  Yeah, but you have to keep the name too!
Chandler  Okay. Thanks.
Phoebe  Okay!
Chandler  You wanna hug it out?
Phoebe  Yeah!
Phoebe  Yay!
Chandler  Yay!
Phoebe  Yayohyay! Okay, I gotta go tell Frank and Alice! Right now!
Chandler  Okay!
Phoebe  Ooh, uh (She grabs her coat and runs out.)
Chandler  Bye, Pheebs!
Phoebe  Okay, bye!
Chandler  Ha! Ha! Ha!
Joey  Ohh! (Realises it was all a trick to get Phoebe to name the baby
Chandler.)
[Scene  The Airport, Carol and Ross are waiting for Emily and Susan to deplane. A
gorgeous woman walks by and they both turn to watch her go.]
Ross  Nice luggage.
Carol  I was gonna say
Susan  Hey!
Ross  Hi!
Emily  Hey! I missed you.
Ross  Oh, I missed you too.
Susan  (To Emily) Thanks for everything, I had such a great time.
Emily  Oh, so did I.
Ross  (To Carol) No tongue. (And gives her the thumbs up.)
[Scene  Rachels bedroom; Rachel is awoken by a man singing in the next
apartment.]
The Singing Man  (singing, duh) Mornings here! Sunshine is here! The sky
is clear, the mornings here! The mornings here!
Rachel  HEY!! Do you have to do that? Its Saturday!
The Singing Man  Oh come on! Mornings here! (Starts singing)
Mornings here! The morning is here! Sunshine is here!
Rachel  I hate this apartment! I hate the color of these walls! I hate
the fact that this place still smells like bird! I hate that singing guy!
Joey  Are you kidding? I love that guy! (Starts singing) Mornings here!
Morning is here
Rachel  Stop it! I will kill you. I hate the fact that my room is so small.
Monica  Hey, I have all the space I need. Just do what I did.
Rachel  Monica, you dont even have a bed, you sleep in a ball on the
floor!
Monica  Yknow what? I am really tired of your bellyaching! Okay,
I-I worked really hard at making this a nice place for us to live!
Rachel  Im sorry. Im so sorry.
Monica  Okay.
Joey  See, this is a great apartment.
Monica  Shut up! This place is a hole!
[Scene  Rosss bedroom; Ross and Emily are making out. Ross as a new feature.]
Emily  Oh, blimey, I still cant believe youve got an earring!
Ross  Huh? I know, I know. Who am I? David Bowe? (Shakes his head around,
pretending like hes jamming.)
Emily  He does that?!
Ross  Uh, I dont know, whatever.
Emily  I think it makes you look really dangerous.
Ross  Oh, I know. Yknow what, I never wouldve gotten this if it
werent for you. No really, when Im with you Im-Im like this whole
other guy, I love that guy! I mean, I love you too, a lot, but that guy! I-I love
that guy!
Emily  I love both of you!
Ross  Yeah?
Emily  I wish I didnt have to go.
Ross  Then dont. Stay here. Just dont go so soon to London, just one
more day.
Emily  Ohh, Ross, please!
Ross  One more day, seriously/
Emily  Dont do this to me, again. Youd know Id stay here in a
minute, but Id really miss so much work, theyll fire me.
Ross  So, then you can stay as long as you want.
Emily  I wish I could.
Ross  Oh no. Dont, dont, dont start packing. Come on! (She
puts some clothes into her bag, and Ross throws them out.)
Emily  I dont think you understand packing. Look, I just dont want
to leave it to the last minute. Last time I left in such a rush, I left my knickers here.
Ross  Yeah, I know, I uh, I tried them on.
Emily  You didnt!
Ross  No. No, I didnt. I didnt want to be that guy.
[Scene  Monica and Rachel's erm, Chandler and Joey's, Joey and Chandler are watching
one of those Kung Fu movies and imitating the moves.]
Phoebe  (entering, wearing Santa pants) Hello!
Chandler  Ho! Ho! Ho!
Phoebe  Excuse me.
Chandler  Your pants!
Phoebe  Oh, yeah! You like em? I just, I went to a used clothes store and
got a bunch of maternity stuff. These are sooo comfortable!
Joey  Uhh, Pheebs, those are uh, those are Santa pants.
Phoebe  What?
Chandler  Santa pants. (Phoebe still doesnt get it.) Santa Clauss
pants.
Phoebe  Nuh-uh! Theyre maternity pants. They even came with a list of baby
names. (Pulls out a sheet of paper which lists whos been naughty and whos been
nice.) See, these names are good, and these names are bad. (Finally, she figures it out.)
Ohh.
Rachel  (entering) Hey!
Monica  (entering) Hey!
Rachel  SoHey, Pheebs! So, how are the elves?
Phoebe  I dont know! How are the-the-the-the, yknowYoure
clothes arent funny.
Monica  Hey, guys, what-what should I wear to a Knicks game?
Chandler  Uhh, a T-shirt that says, "I dont belong here."
Joey  You have Knicks tickets?
Rachel  Yeah, my mom got my dads season tickets in the divorce, so she
just gave them to me.
Monica  Yeah, apparently, theyre pretty good seats.
Rachel  Yeah.
Joey  (examining the tickets) Oh my God! Those are almost right on the floor!
Rachel  Do you guys want these?
Joey 
Chandler  Yeah we do!
Rachel  Ohh, well you got em.
Both 
Rachel  Just give us our apartment back!
Phoebe  Boy! I didnt see that coming!
Chandler  Are you serious?
Rachel  Oh, come on! We know what these are worth.
Monica  Yeah, what, do you think were stupid?
Joey  Youre not stupid. Youre meaner than I thought.
Monica  What do you say?
Chandler  Forget it! Okay, Im not giving up my bachelor pad for some
basketball seats!
Rachel  Youre bachelor pad?!
Monica  Have you even had a girl up here?
Chandler  No. But uh, Joey has, and I usually talk to them in the morning time.
Joey  Yeah, you do!
[Scene  Central Perk, Joey is whining to Chandler about the tickets.]
Joey  Come on!
Chandler  (ignoring him) Yes, Gunther, can I get two cups of chino, please?
Gunther  Good one.
Joey  Come on, season tickets! Season tickets, do you know what that means?
Chandler  Forget it! Okay, Im not giving up the apartment.
Joey  Oh comelook, when I was a kid my dads company gave season
tickets to the number one salesman every year, all right? My dad never won! Of
course, he wasnt in the sales division, but still, I never ever, ever forgot that!
Ross  (entering) Hey, guys! (They both notice his new little friend)
Joey  Hey!
Chandler  Oh my God!
Joey  We dont make enough fun of you already?
Ross  Oh yeah, Emily convinced me to do it.
Chandler  You do know that Wham broke up?
Ross  I like it, and Emily likes it, and thats what counts. So uh, how are
you guys doing?
Joey  Oh-no, dont try and talk all normal with that thing in your ear.
Chandler  Where is Emily?
Ross  Ugh, shes saying good-bye to her uncle.
Chandler  Man, didnt she like just get here?
Ross  Yeah!! Yeah!
Chandler  Easy tiger.
Ross  I just, I hate this so much! I mean, every time I go pick her up at the
airport, its-its so great. But at the same time Im thinking, "Well,
Im gonna be right back there in a couple of days, dropping her off."
Chandler  So what are you going to do?
Ross  Nothing! Theres nothing to do! I mean, she lives there, I live here.
I mean, she-shed have to uh, move here. She should move here!
Joey  What?
Ross  I could ask her to live with me!
Chandler  Are you serious?
Ross  I mean, why not! I mean, I mean why not?!
Chandler  Because youve only known her for six weeks! Okay, Ive got
a carton of milk in my fridge Ive had a longer relationship with!
Ross  Look guys, when Im with her its-its-its like she
brings this-this-this great side out of me. I mean I-I-I love her, yknow?
Chandler  And I love the milk! But, Im not gonna some British girl to move
in with me! (Realizes that made no sense.) Joey, you say things now.
Joey  All right look, Ross, hes right. Emilys great, shes
great! But this way too soon, youre only gonna scare her!
Ross  I dont want to do that.
Joey  No! You dont want to wreck it, you dont want to go to fast!
Ross  Yeah, no, youre right, I know, youre right, Im not,
Im not gonna do it. All right, thanks guys. (Gets up to leave.)
Chandler  Okay, no problem, just remember to wake us up before you go-go.
[Scene  Monica and Rachel's erm, Chandler and Joey's, later that same day. Joey and
Chandler are eating pizza, and Phoebe is trying to knit something.]
Phoebe  Thats too hard. Too hard!
Monica  (entering with Rachel) All right boys, last chance for the tickets!
Rachel  Or Ill give them to my new boyfriend, Joshua.
Chandler  No thank you.
Joey  Wait-wait-wait-wait! (To Chandler) Come on! Come on, lets trade! The
timings perfect, I just clogged the toilet!
Chandler  Look, I want those basketball seats as much as you do! Okay, but we
cant leave in the small apartment after weve lived here! Didnt you ever
read Flowers for Algernon?
Joey  Yes! Didnt you ever read Sports Illustrated?! No! I
didnt read yours! But come on, we can go to the game tonight!
Chandler  Look, the only way I will even consider this is if they offer a lot
more than just season seats.
Joey  Its the Knicks!
Chandler  Screw the Knicks!
Joey  Whoa!
Chandler  I didnt mean that. I just meant that the apartment is worth so
much more.
Joey  Huh.
Chandler  And the Knicks rule all.
Joey  Yeah, the Knicks rule all!
Phoebe  Hey, so? Are you gonna do it?
Chandler  No. No. Were not gonna do that, yknow why? Because its not
an even trade.
Rachel  All right, okay, look, what if you could keep the apartment and get the
tickets?
Joey  Done!
Rachel  Let me finish.
Joey  Oh.
Rachel  Im talking about a bet, winner takes all.
Joey  Ooh, we could end up with nothing.
Phoebe  Or you could end up with everything.
Joey  Ooh, I like that.
Monica  All right, so what do you say?
Chandler  No!
Monica  Oh, just do it!!
Chandler  Op, op, Im convinced!
Joey  Come on man, you know Id do it for you! Because, youre my best
friend.
Chandler  All right, but you cant use that again for a whole year.
Im in.
Joey  All right!
Phoebe  Ooh, this is so exciting! Ooh, God, what are you going to bet?
Rachel  Oh, okay, well, I think we should let Phoebe decide, because shes
the only whos impartial, and shes so pretty.
Phoebe  Okay. Umm, ooh, oohoh, I have a game!
Joey  Okay!
Chandler  Okay!
Phoebe  This is great!
Joey  Whats the game?! Whats the game?!
Phoebe  Oh, well, it doesnt have a nameoh, okay, Phoebeball! No, it
doesnt have a name. Umm, okay, Monica, what is your favourite thing about trees?
Monica  Theyre green?
Phoebe  Good! Good! Five points!
Phoebe  All right, Joey, same question.
Joey  Uhh, theyre tall.
Phoebe  Ooh, three points. Both fine answers, but we were looking for leafy,
leafy.
Monica  Thats not even a game!
Rachel  What? Shut up! Were winning!
Monica  You wanna finish this right now? All right, we get a deck of cards, high
card wins. What do you say?
Chandler  Fine, lets do it.
Phoebe  Oh, I have cards!
Joey  Oh.
Monica  Oh, good.
Phoebe  Yeah! Here! (She grabs a deck out of her purse) Oh no, these are the
trick deck. Okay. Here yes. Okay.
Chandler  Okay, you guys uh, you guys pick first
Rachel  Okay.
Monica  Okay. (She picks a card.) Four.
Chandler  Thats a low one!
Joey  Yeah! Okay. (Joey picks a card.) Phoebe, you look, I cant.
Phoebe  What make you think I can?! (Shields her eyes from it.)
Joey  Okay. Okay. (He looks at the card.) Ace!
Chandler  Why are you screaming and hugging?
Monica  Because we won our apartment back!
Joey  What? Ace is high! Jack, queen, king, ace!
Monica  No! Ace is low! Ace, two, three, four!
Phoebe  I dont know. Ooh! Ooh! Look it! (She fans out the trick deck.)
Ah-ha!
Rachel  All right, cut, lets pick again, pick again.
Joey  Okay.
Rachel  Come on apartment! Come on apartment! (Picks a card.) Oh! I know queen
is high!
Joey  Uh-huh, not as high as(picks a card) It worked! King!
Chandler  Yeah baby!
Monica  But, we pick again! We pick again!
Joey  Why?!
Monica  I dont know!
Chandler  Tickets please! (Rachel hands over the tickets) Thats courtside
baby!
Joey  Seriously, good game though. Good game. (He tries to congratulate them,
but they pull away.) (To Chandler) What are they so mad about? They get the apartment
back!
Chandler  No they didnt!
[Scene  Rosss apartment, Emily has packed as Ross returns.]
Ross  Hey!
Emily  I packed while you were gone. I left some knickers under your pillow.
Ross  (laughs) Move in with me.
Emily  What?!
Ross  Dont be scared, I-I know it sounds crazy and-and people will say
its too soon, but just-just think, think how great it will be.
Emily  Ohh, no. Ugh. Oh, leaving London, my whole family lives there.
Ross  I know.
Emily  My job!
Ross  Well, so, you-youll get a job here! I mean, Im always hearing
about uh, them foreigners coming in here and stealing American jobs; that could be you!
Emily  Yeah, but it-it-its my whole lifeyou come to England.
Ross  No, I cant. I would, I really would, but my son is here; I
cant leave him. Isntyou dont think theres any way?
Emily  Ohh, I dont think so. I mean it would be different if it was way
into the future and-and-and we were getting married or something.
Ross  What?
Emily  Oh no, no, right I shouldnt have said married. Uh, please
dont go freaky on me. I didnt mean it. Well, I didnt say it; I take it
back!
Ross  No, no, dont. Why dont we?
Emily  Why dont we what?
Ross  Get married.
Emily  You are mad!
Ross  No! No! Im not! Its-its-its perfect! I mean
its better than you just-just moving here, cause its us together
forever, and thats-thats what I want.
Emily  Weve only known each other for six weeks!
Ross  Yeah, I know, so what? I mean, whos-whos to say? Does that me
we-we cant do it? Look, huh, I was with Carol for four years before we got married
and I wound up divorced from a pregnant lesbian. I mean, this, this makes sense for us.
Come on! I mean, on our first date we ended up spending the whole weekend in Vermont! I
mean, last night I got my ear pierced! Me! This feels right. Doesnt it?
Emily  My parents are going to be really mad.
Ross  Is thatare you saying yes? Is that yes?
Emily  Yes.
Emily  Yes!
Ross  Yes! Were getting married?!
Emily  Oh my God!
Ross  Yes!
Emily  Were getting married!
Ross  Come here, come here. Uh, (He takes the earring out.) ow! Emily, will you
marry me?
Emily  Yes.
Emily  Ohh, its a bit small.
Ross  Damn! I thought that was going to be romantic as hell!
Emily  It was.
[Scene  The hallway, Joey and Chandler are coming back from the game.]
Chandler  Those were like the best seats ever.
Joey  Oh yeah. Hey! Should we give these shirts to the girls? Yknow, kinda
like a peace offering.
Chandler  Oh yeah, thats very nice. Plus, yknow they were free and
theyre too small.
Chandler  Oh. Oh, God! (He starts running around like a chicken with his head
cut off.)
Joey  Hey, want a beer? (Hands him a beer and sits down in one of the chairs.)
(Jumping up.) WHOA!!!!
Chandler  I KNOW!!!
Chandler  Open up! Open up! Open up!
Monica  Well discuss it, in the morning! (Slams the door shut.)
Chandler  What the hell is going on?!
Rachel  We took our apartment back!! (Slams the door shut.)
Phoebe  (opening the door) I had nothing to do with it. (Closes the door.)
(Opens the door.) Okay, it was my idea, but I dont feel good about it.
Chandler  We are switching back, right now!
Monica  No, were not! Were not leaving!
Chandler  Well, youre gonna have to leave sometime, because you both have
jobs, and as soon as you do, were switching it back! Theres nothing you can do
to stop us! Right, Joe?
Joey  I dont know.
Chandler  What?
Joey  I dont want to move again!
Chandler  I dont care, this is our apartment! And they stoleyou
stole itour apartment, and we won that apartment fair and square, twice! And I am
getting it back right now. Im getting back right now!
Rachel  All right. We figured you might respond this way, so we have a backup
offer.
Chandler  Oh no-no-no, no more offers. You cant offer anything to us!
Rachel  Let us keep the apartment and
Monica  As a thank you, Rachel and I will kiss for one minute.
Chandler  Totally worth it!
Joey  That was one good minute!
Chandler  Good night.
Joey  Good night.
Monica  Men are such idiots.
Rachel  Yeah! Can you believe that something that stupid actually got us our
apartment back?
Phoebe  Thats so funny to think if youd just done that right after
the last contest, no one would have had to move at all.
Monica  Yeah, let-let-lets pretend thats not true.
Rachel  Yeah.
Phoebe  Okay, scarfs done. (Its not really a scarf, its just a
bunch of yarn that Phoebe has tied together. Just then, Ross and Emily enter dragging with
them Joey and Chandler.)
Ross  Come on! Come on. Come on.
Chandler  Okay!
Phoebe  Hey!
Ross  Hey!
Monica  What-whats going on?
Joey  Ross has some big thing to tell everyone.
Ross  Uhh, okay, its uh, Emily and I, we decided to uh, to get married.
Phoebe  What? Oh, are you pregnant too?!
Emily  Umm, no.
Monica  When, when didhow, how did you
Ross  We, we just decided to uh, to go for it.
Emily  I mean, we know its a bit hasty but, uh, it just feels so right,
so
Ross  (turning around.) Umm, uh, I was just telling the guys
Rachel  Yeah, I-I heard. (Pause, everyone looks at each other, waiting for
Rachels reaction.) I think its great! (Hugs Ross.) Ohh, Im so happy for
you!
Chandler  Oh, well, thats great!
Joey  Yeah! Yeah!
Monica  (to Ross) I cant believe youre getting married!
Ross  Yeah. (They hug again.)
Joey  Monica and Rachel made out. (Giggles like a schoolboy and Monica glares at
him.)
[Scene  Joeys bedroom, he is awoken by the singing guy.]
The Singing Man  (singing) Mornings here! The mornings here!
Both 
The Singing Man  Hey! Youre back!
Joey  Hey! (Singing) Get into gear!
The Singing Man  (singing) Breakfast is near!
Both 
The Singing Man  Ill see you tomorrow morning!
Joey  (happily) Okay!

[Scene  Joeys bedroom, he is asleep and snoring loudly. Chandler enters wondering
who left their engine running.]
Chandler  Are you kidding me?! Joey. Joey! Joey! Joey! Joey! Joey! Joey! Joey!
Joey! Joey!!
Joey  (joining in, in his sleep) Joey. Joey. Joey. Joey! Joey!!
Chandler  Oh. Oh, did-did-did I wake you?
[Scene  Central Perk, Chandler is getting another cup of coffee.]
Chandler  Gunther, can I get another cup of coffee, please? (Gunther starts to
pour him another cup.) So uh, what do you do when youre not working here?
Gunther  You dont need to fill these silences.
Chandler  Oh, okay, thanks. (He goes back to the couch and rejoins Monica, Joey,
and Phoebe.)
Monica  Chandler, thats like your fourth cup of coffee!
Chandler  Well, I am drinking lots of cups of coffee because Im exhausted!
Because Joey started snoring!
Monica  Hes in a different room! Hes really that loud?
Joey  (proudly) Oh, you should here me.
Chandler  Its not something to be proud of, okay? You have to go to a
sleep clinic!
Joey  Look, I told ya, Im not going to any clinic! I dont have a
problem, youre the one with the problem! You should go to a "Quit being a baby
and leave me alone" clinic!
Chandler  They dont have those.
Joey  Yeah, they do! Quit being a baby and leave me alone! There, youve
just had your first class!
Monica  Yknow I used to go out with this guy that was a really light
sleeper, and whenever I started to snore, he would just roll me over
Joey  Ohhh, yeah!
Monica  He would just roll me over and I would stop snoring.
Chandler  Next time you snore, Im rolling ya over!
Joey  I gotta do what I gotta do, you gotta do what you gotta do, you just do
it.
Ross  (entering) Hey guys!
Chandler  Hey, all right!
Phoebe  Hey!
Phoebe  Oh, the Olympics.
Monica  Have you guys picked a date yet?
Ross  Oh no, not yet.
Phoebe  I still cannot believe youre engaged! (Ross looks at her)
Just cause its happening so fast; not cause youre such a loser.
Ross  Oh. Thanks. Uh, has anyone seen Rach?
Monica  Ugh, shes upstairs not doing the dishes! And I tell ya
something! Im not doing them this time! I dont care if those dishes sit in the
sink until theyre all covered withIll do them when I get home!
Ross  Yeahoh! Hey listen umm, Emily found this wedding dress in
London
Phoebe  Already?!
Ross  Yeah, but it didnt fit. Well, luckily theres a store here that
has one left in her size, but Im the groom, Im not supposed to see the
dress
Monica  Ill pick it up for you!
Ross  Thank you.
Monica  Okay.
Chandler  Oh, shes got you running errands, yknow, picking up
wedding dresses (Laughs and makes like Indiana Jones and his whip) Wah-pah!
Ross  Whats wah-pah?
Chandler  Yknow, whipped! Wah-pah!
Joey  Thats not whipped! Whipped is wh-tcssh!
Chandler  Thats what I did. Wah-pah!
Joey  You cant do anything!
[Scene  Monica and Rachel's, Rachel is not doing the dishes. She hears someone coming
up the stairs and quickly puts down her magazine and pretends like shes actually
doing the dishes.]
Rachel  Hey, Mon, I was just doing the dishes!
Ross  Hey!
Rachel  Oh! Its you. (She stops doing the dishes.) Hi.
Ross  Hey, do uh, do you have a minute?
Rachel  Yeah, yeah, I was just about to take a break anyways, so
Ross  So listen uh, I know you and I havent really had a chance to talk
since uh, Emily and I decided to get married, and uh, I was just wondering how you were.
Rachel  Oh.
Ross  I know if you were getting married Id feel, kinda..
yknow.
Rachel  Yeah. Yeah. Definitely, well it definitely took me by surprise, but
Im okay.
Ross  Yeah?
Rachel  Yeah.
Ross  All right, I just wanted to check.
Rachel  Oh, thats sweet.
Ross  Youre great. And I-I know someday this will happen for you too. You
just hang in there.
Rachel  (breaking the hug) Uhh, hang in there?
Ross  Oh, no, I didnt mean, uh
Rachel  I mean maybe you didnt hear about a serious relationship called me
and Joshua?
Ross  Oh, I thought you guys had just been on like four dates, I didnt
realise that had become anything, yet.
Rachel  Oh, no-no-no, no-no-no, it has become, it hasyeah. Oh no, those
were four great dates.
Ross  Oh. Yeah?
Rachel  Yeah. Oh, yeah. And I mean, the connection, I mean yknow,
emotionally, mentally, physically
Ross  Wow, thats-thats-thats incredible.
Rachel  I know isnt it? Its like Im right there with Joshua.
Ross  Uh-huh.
Rachel  You are right there with Emily. And its yknow, its
kinda like. its a tie! Well, I gotta get, I gotta get back to the dishes.
Ross  I gotta get to work.
Rachel  Oh yeah? Fine.
Ross  Hey, yknow, yknow what would make me really happy?
Rachel  Oh yeah, no, whats that?
Ross  If like the four of us could all yknow, hang out together. Uh, in
fact Emilys coming into town this weekend, why dont you say we all have
dinner? Say, Sunday night?
Rachel  That would be great!
Ross  Yeah, all right, its a date. (He leaves)
Rachel  (to the closed door) Hang in there. You hang in there. (Gives him the
raspberry.)
Ross  (coming back in) Did you say something?
Rachel  No, just singing. (Does a little song.)
[Scene  Beatrice Bridal Shop, Monica and Phoebe are there to pick up Emilys
dress.]
Monica  Oh my God! Ohh! Look at this one! Its so beautiful!
Phoebe  Yeah, but yknow, about have of these are gonna end up getting
divorced.
The Saleslady  May I help you ladies?
Monica  Oh, yes, umm, Im here to pick up a dress that you have on hold.
The Saleslady  Yes, whats the name, please?
Monica  Emily Waltham.
The Saleslady  Yes! I have it right here. (Phoebe and Monica both gasp at the
dress.) Would you like to try it on Ms. Waltham?
Monica  (laughs) Okay.
Phoebe  Youre the most beautiful bride Ive ever seen.
Monica  I am, arent I?
The Saleslady  Ms. Waltham?
Monica  Yes?
The Saleslady  Were closing.
Monica  All right. (Goes to take off the dress.)
The Saleslady  And could I get my ring back?
[Scene  Joeys bedroom, hes snoring again and Chandler is there to roll him
over.]
Chandler  All right buddy, time to roll over. (Rolls him over, and discovers a
surprise) (Looking down) No-no! (Covers his eyes) No, no-n-n-n-no!! You are going to a
clinic! Youre going to a clinic, and a pyjama store!
[Scene  Monica and Rachel's, Monica is doing the dishes.]
Monica  Does she use the cups? Yes! I believe she does. Does she use the plates?
Yes! I believe she does. (Looks at the wedding dress and stops.)
Monica  Oh. Thank you. Ohhh, thank you very much. Oh, thank you for coming.
(Theres a knock on the door.) Uh, just a second!
Phoebe  No-no, let me in!
Monica  Phoebe?
Phoebe  Yeah!
Monica  Can you just hold on for one minute?
Phoebe  No, you have to let me in right now!!
Monica  Are you alone?
Phoebe  Yes!
Monica  All right.
[Scene  Chandler and Joey's, Joey is complaining about going to the clinic.]
Joey  This sucks! I didnt know I had to stay up all night before I went to
this stupid sleep clinic! Im so tired!
Joey  Yeah, well
Rachel  (entering) Hi!
Chandler  Hey, I hear that you and Joshua are going out to dinner with Ross and
Emily, and I think thats, I think thats really cool.
Joey  Yeah, Rach, I think youre handling that really well.
Rachel  Handling it? What do you mean, handling it? Theres nothing to
handle. Now, maybe I would have a problem with this if it wasnt for me and Joshua.
Yknow, theyre not gonna get married anyway!
Chandler  What?
Rachel  Come on! They rushed into this thing so fast its ridiculous! I
mean, theyre gonna be engaged for like what? A year? And somewhere along the way,
one of them is gonna realise what theyve done and theyre call the whole thing
off. Im telling ya, youre gonna be dancing at my wedding before youre
dancing at theres.
Chandler  Yeah, well, I dont dance at weddings.
Rachel  Why not?
Chandler  Because weddings are a great place to meet women, and when I dance, I
look like this (Starts to dancing really, really, really badly. Ross enters behind
him and he stops.)
Ross  Hey man.
Chandler  Hey!
Ross  So, what are you guys doing four weeks from today?
Chandler  Nothing.
Rachel  Nothing.
Joey  I am (Looks in his date book.) free!
Ross  Great! Because Emily and I are getting married in a month!
Joey and Chandler 
Ross  Yep!
Rachel  In a month?
Ross  Yeah!
Rachel  You mean, you mean 30 days?
Ross  Yeah.
Rachel  From now?
Ross  Yeah.
Rachel  Well, thats great.
Ross  Yeah! Yeah, Emily always wanted to get married in this beautiful place
that her parents got married, but its going to be torn down, so I mean, I-I
know its crazy, but everything up til now has been so crazy, and I dont
know, this just feels right. Yknow?
Joey  (still looking in date book) Hey! Thats the day after I stop
menstruating! (They all look at him.) This isnt mine.
[Scene  Central Perk, Rachel is waiting impatiently for Joshua.]
Joshua  (entering) Hey, Rachel.
Rachel  Hi!
Joshua  Whats up? Youre voice sounded all squeaky on the phone.
Rachel  Ohh, nothing, I just wanted to see you. See you and hug you. (Hugs him)
See you.
Joshua  Great!
Rachel  Yeah! (She sits down) Sit!
Joshua  (sitting) You okay?
Rachel  Im more than okay, I am really, really happy! Wanna know why?
Joshua  Do I?
Rachel  Cause I am really happy about us. I think we are, I think we are
so on the right track! Yknow? I mean, I think we are working, I think we are
clicking. Yknow?
Joshua  Yeah, sure-sure, yeah,
were-were-were-were-were clicking.
Rachel  Yeah-yeah, yknow if-if there was just like one little area where
Ithat I think we needwe would need to work on; I-I would think it was
were just not crazy enough!
Joshua  I-I gotta say, I-I-I-Im not too sure I agree with that.
Rachel  Well, yeah, right, yknow what? Yeah, youre right, I mean, we
no, we have our fun. Yeah! But if (Grunts uncomprehensively)I mean, I mean
like craaaazy! Yknow? Okay, all right. This is gonna, this is gonna sound
yknow, a little umm, hasty, but uh, just go with it. Umm. Ugh. What if we got
married?
Joshua  What?! (Gunther is listening in.)
Rachel  Oh, I know, I know, its-its so, its so totally like,
"Whoa! Can we do this?" Yknow, I mean, but I mean it just feels right!
Dont you think? It does! I mean, it just feels right, dont you think?
Joshua  Wow! Uhh, Rachel uhh, youre a real special lady, but my divorce
isnt final yet and, and, and weve been on four days, so Im thinking
"No, but thanks."
Gunther  YOU IDIOT!!!!!
[Scene  The Sleep Clinic, Joey is having trouble staying awake.]
Sleep Clinic Worker  Your name, please?
Joey  Joey Tribbiani.
Sleep Clinic Worker  Um-hmm, and did you stay up all night in preparation for
your sleep study. (Joey doesnt answer) Uh, sir? (Joey starts snoring)
Chandler  (answering for him) Yes he did.
Sleep Clinic Worker  Alll right, well call you in a few minutes.
Chandler  (waking Joey) Hey, check out that girl! She is really hot!
Joey  (sleepily) Yeah, she is. Wow! (Falls back asleep, loudly) How you
doin?
Joey  What?!
Chandler  Youre coming on to the entire room! (He goes over to pick up a
stack of magazines next to her, and to get her attention, he throws them back down.)
Im Chandler.
Woman  Im Marjorie.
Chandler  Hi.
Marjorie  Hi.
Chandler  You mind if I
Marjorie  No, please.
Chandler  So uh, what are you in for?
Marjorie  I talk in my sleep.
Chandler  What a coincidence, I listen in my sleep.
Joey  (asleep) So why dont you give me your number?
[Scene  Monica and Rachel's, Monica and Phoebe, still defying reality, are now throwing
a bouquet at each other, pretending to catch the actual bouquet at an actual
wedding.]
Monica  Okay, ready?
Phoebe  Yeah.
Monica  Okay.
Phoebe  (catching it) I got it! Mine! (They both hug)
Monica  Congratulations!
Phoebe  Thank you!
Monica  Okay! My turn! My turn!
Phoebe  Okay! (Gets into position) Okay, ready?
Monica  (cocking her head from side to side in some pre-bouquet-catching ritual)
Yeah.
Phoebe  Okay. (Phoebe turns and throws it on the couch.)
Monica  (upset) That was a terrible throw!!
Phoebe  Im not gonna right to you! Thats not real!
Monica  Look at me! My big concern is whats real?! (Finally realises) Oh
my God. Were really sad, arent we?
Phoebe  Yeah, I think we are.
Monica  This isnt even my dress.
Phoebe  Well, at least you didnt rent yours from a store called,
"Its Not Too Late."
Monica  Im changing out of this.
Phoebe  Me too.
Monica  In like a half-hour?
Phoebe  Me too.
Monica  Okay, throw it straight this time.
Phoebe  Okay.
Monica  Im getting married next!!
Phoebe  Yay!
[Scene  Central Perk, Monica and Phoebe, back to reality, are sitting in normal
clothes.]
Phoebe  I hate my regular clothes now! Yknow? I look down and-and I
know that this isnt gonna be the most special day of my life.
Monica  Yeah. I mean it was kinda fun for a while, but didnt you start
feeling silly?
Phoebe  I guess.
Phoebe  Oh my God!
Monica  Oh God.
Phoebe  Oh, youre such a cheater!
Chandler  (entering) Hello! Little ones.
Monica  Hey!
Phoebe  Hey!
Monica  So, is Joey gonna stop snoring?
Chandler  Yep! And! A beautiful woman agreed to go out with me. (Theyre
stunned.) Joey wanted to ask her out, but uh, she picked me.
Phoebe  Oh, howd that happen?
Chandler  Because Im cooler.
Monica  No, seriously.
Chandler  Well shes, shes the kinda girlJoey was unconscious.
Joey  (muffled by the mouth guard) Hey you guys! Whats happening?
Monica  Oh my God!
Phoebe  What is that?
Joey  (muffled) Oh, they gave it to me at the sleep clinic, and its gonna
help me not to snore.
Monica  Well, are you asleep right now, Joe? Cause I dont think you
have to wear it unless you are!
Joey  (takes out the mouth guard) I know I dont have too! It tastes good.
(Puts it back in.)
Chandler  Plus, you look cool.
[Scene  Monica and Rachel's, Monica is putting away the wedding dress, finally.]
Rachel  (entering from her bedroom) Well, I just called Joshua
Phoebe  Oh, how did it go?
Rachel  Well, I did my best to convince him that Im not some crazy girl
who is dying to get marriedIm just going through a hard time.
Phoebe  What did he say?
Rachel  Well uh, his answering machine was very understanding. Ugh. I
feel blue.
Monica  Ohh, sweetie! (Goes to comfort her.) Hey, I bet you anything that
hes gonna call you again.
Rachel  Yeah, maybe, but I dont think I even care. I dont think
hes the one Im sad about. Yknow, I know that I said that I am totally
okay with Ross getting married, but as it turns out, I dont think Im handling
it all that well.
Phoebe  Yeah, maybe.
Rachel  And I-I am just trying to figure out why.
Phoebe  Any luck?
Rachel  Well, yeah, yknow how Ross and I were on again, off again, on
again, off again? I guess I just figured that somewhere down the road, we would be on
again.
Monica  Again. Yknow what? I think we all did.
Ross  (entering) Hey!
Monica  Hey! (She jumps up and throws Emilys wedding dress into
Rachels room.)
Ross  So, I got us some reservations for Sunday night, okay? How about,
Ernies at 9 oclock?
Rachel  Yeah, well, you uh, better make it for three.
Ross  Oh, see I-I dont know if were gonna be hungry at three.
Rachel  Three people. Joshuas not gonna be there.
Ross  What happened?
Rachel  Uh, well, I think, I think he broke up with me.
Ross  Noo. Why?
Rachel  Well, apparently he scares easy.
Ross  Oh, Rachel, Im-Im sorry.
Rachel  Its okay. Sometimes, things dont work out the way youd
thought they would.
Ross  Come here.
Rachel  (breaking the hug) Oh, hey, dont you have to go pick up Emily?
Ross  Yeah.
Rachel  Yeah.
Ross  You okay?
Rachel  Yeah! I got my girls.
Rachel  Ugh. (She goes over and lays her head on Phoebes lap.)
Phoebe  (looks at Monica) Hey, yknow what might cheer you up?
Rachel  What?
Rachel  Yknow, I gotta tell ya, this really does put in a better mood.
Monica  Oh, I wish there was a job where I could wear this all the time. (Pause)
Maybe someday, there will be.
Monica  Oh God! Hes gonna come by and borrow some candles for his big
date!
Rachel  Oh, okay! (She goes to answer the door.)
Monica  No-no, Rachel, dont get it! He cant see us!
Phoebe  No, yeah! The groom cannot see the bride!
Rachel  Im not gonna marry Chandler!
Phoebe  Not after this!
Rachel  Okay, you guys, just relax. (She goes over to open the door, and as she
does, she says.) I doooo. (Sees that its Joshua, not Chandler that knocked on the
door.)
Joshua  I gotta go.
Rachel  Oh, wait, Joshua! Joshua! (Pause) (Comes back inside) Yeah, well, that
oughta do it.
[Scene  Chandlers bedroom, he is sleeping with Marjorie. All of the sudden,
Marjorie starts talking in her sleep, awakening Chandler. After a little bit, she quiets
back down, and Chandler tries to get back to sleep. Theres a short pause until she
starts screaming, causing Chandler to scream with her. She quickly calms down. This all
wakes up Joey, who comes over wearing the mouth guard, opens the top half of
Chandlers door, and starts to complain about the noise.]
Joey  (muffled by the mouth guard) Dude! I am trying to sleep! (Shrugs to
say, "Whats up with that?")
[Scene  Central Perk, Joey and Chandler are sitting and talking.]
Chandler  Yknow what? It seems like all of the sudden; so much has
happened.
Joey  I know. Ross is getting married.
Chandler  Phoebe is, making people.
Joey  Everybodys doing stuff!
Chandler  And we just sit here. I mean if I die the only way people would even
know I was here, would be by the ass print on this chair! Look, we have to do something.
Okay? Something huge!
Joey  (snaps his fingers) We could climb Mt. Everest!
Chandler  No-no, not something stupid, something huge.
Joey  No-no-no-no-no, I saw an ad for this video, people climb that thing
everyday! We could totally do that!
Chandler  Why not?! I mean its just, its just climbing! Its
just, its just steep!
Joey  Yeah!
Chandler  Were going to Everest! Okay, it would be nice to leave an ass
print on Everest!
Phoebe  (entering) Hey!
Joey  Hey!
Phoebe  What-whats up?
Joey  Were gonna climb Mt. Everest!
Chandler  Yeah baby!
Phoebe  Really?! I looked into that. Yeah, but, I mean it costs like $60,000 and
yknow you can die. And, you would die!
Chandler  (dejected) Yeah, well
Joey  We could get that Everest video though.
Chandler  Yeah, we could do that without yknow risking our lives at all!
Joey  And while were down at the video store, you know what else we could
rent? Die Hard! (Chandlers excited.) Oh, yknow what? I just remembered,
that Everest thing is only available through mail order.
Chandler  (dejected) Oh, well
Phoebe  So you guysll stay here and hang out with me?
Chandler  Yeeeeahhhh.
Joey  Yeah. Yeah.
Chandler  But Ill tell you something. One of these days were get off
of our buts and rent Die Hard again!
Joey  Yeah we are!
[Scene  Rosss apartment, he and Emily are addressing their invitations.]
Emily  So what did he decide? Does your Uncle Nathan get an invite or not?
Ross  Ohh, God, nobody likes him, and hes so cheap, hed never fly to
London in a million years. Yeah, invite him? Hey, did I do these neat enough? (Hands her
some envelopes.)
Emily  Yeah, theyre fine.
Ross  Yeah?
Emily  If anyone asks, well just say Ben addressed them. (Looking through
the envelopes.) Oh! So you invited Rachel then?
Ross  Sure. Why not?
Emily  Really?
Ross  Yeah?
Emily  I dont think Id be comfortable with any of my old lovers
there.
Ross  Wait-wait-wait, do you, do you think, maybe we shouldnt invite her?
Emily  Oh, no-no, yknow I absolutely adore Rachel its just that,
well it might be a awkward for you. But its absolutely your decision. (Gets up.)
More tea?
Ross  Yeah sure.
Emily  Earl Grey?
Ross  Huh? Yeah, fine, invite whoever you want.
[Scene  Central Perk, Ross is complaining about Carol.]
Ross  I don't want to be single, okay? I just... I just- I just wanna be married
again!
Chandler  And I just want a million dollars! (He extends his hand hopefully.)
Monica  Rachel?!
Rachel  Oh God Monica hi! I just went to your building and you weren't there and
then this guy with a big hammer said you might be here and you are, you are!
Monica  Okay, everybody, this is Rachel, another Lincoln High survivor. (To
Rachel) This is everybody, this is Chandler, and Phoebe, and Joey, and- you remember my
brother Ross?
Rachel  Hi, sure!
Ross  Hi.
[Scene  Monica and Rachel's, Ross and Rachel are finishing up some cookies.]
Ross  You know you probably didn't know this, but back in high school, I had a,
um, major crush on you.
Rachel  I knew.
Ross  You did! Oh.... I always figured you just thought I was Monica's geeky
older brother.
Rachel  I did.
Ross  Oh. Listen, do you think- and try not to let my intense vulnerability
become any kind of a factor herebut do you think it would be okay if I asked you
out? Sometime? Maybe?
Rachel  Yeah, maybe...
Ross  Okay... okay, maybe I will...
[Scene  Monica and Rachel's, Ross and Rachel are talking about passion.]
Ross   See, I see.... big passion in your future.
Rachel  Really?
Ross  I do.
Rachel  Oh Ross, you're so great. [she playfully rubs his head and gets up]
Joey  It's never gonna happen.
[Scene  Monica and Rachel's balcony, Ross is about to be attacked by Paulo's cat.]
Ross  Hey, I have a question. Well, actually, it's not so much a question as..
more of a general wondering... ment.
Rachel  Okay.
Ross  Okay. Umm, for a while now, I've been wanting to, um....
Rachel  Ohhh!!!! [looking at something behind Ross]
Ross  Yes, yes, that's right...
Rachel  Oh, look at the little cat! [a small kitten is on the roof behind Ross]
Look at it!
Ross  What? [the cat jumps on his shoulders] Ow!
Monica, Joey, and Phoebe  [singing] I'm on top of the world,
looking down on creation and the only explanation I can find...
[Scene  The Laundromat, Rachel is fighting with that old, annoying woman for a cart.]
Rachel  All right, listen, missy. If you want this cart, you're gonna have to
take me with it!
Rachel  (to Ross) Yes! Did you see that?
Ross  You were incredible! Brand new woman, ladies and gentlemen.
Rachel  I could not have done this without you.
Ross  Ok, um, uh, more clothes in the dryer? (Ross turns and bangs his head on
an open dryer door.) I'm fine, I'm fine.
[Scene  Central Perk, I'm sure you've guessed, it's the famous fight scene between Ross
and Rachel.]
Ross  You had no right to tell me you ever had feelings for me.
Rachel  (hurt) What?
Ross  I was doing great with Julie before I found out about you.
Rachel  Hey, I was doin' great before I found out about you. You think it's easy
for me to see you with Julie?
Ross  The point is I... I don't need this right now, OK. It, it's too late, I'm
with somebody else, I'm happy. This ship has sailed.
Rachel  Alright, fine, you go ahead and you do that, alright Ross.
Ross  Fine.
Rachel  'Cause I don't need your stupid ship.
Ross  Good.
Rachel  Good. (Ross leaves)
[Scene  Monica and Rachel's, Ross and Rachel are arguing.]
Rachel  Ross do you realise this is the first time in my life Im doing
something I actually care about. This is the first time in my life Im doing
something that Im actually good at. I mean. if you dont get that...
Ross  No, hey, I get that, okay, I get that big time. And Im happy for ya,
but Im tired of having a relationship with your answering machine! Okay, I
dont know what to do anymore.
Rachel  Well neither do I!
Ross  Is this about Mark?
Rachel  (shocked) Oh my God.
Ross  Okay, its not, its not.
Rachel  Oh my God. I cannot keep having this same fight over and over again,
Ross, no, youre, youre, youre making this too hard.
Ross  Oh Im, Im making this too hard. Okay, what do you want me to
do.
Rachel  I dont know, I dont know. Urrrgh! Look, maybe we should take
a break.
Ross  Okay, okay, fine, youre right. Lets ah, lets take a
break, (goes to the door) lets cool off, okay, lets get some frozen yogart, or
something.. (opens the door)
Rachel  No. (Ross is standing in the doorway.) A break from us.
[Scene  Ross's apartment, Ross is hurrying Chloe out the door.]
Chloe  Do I know why were rushing?
Ross  Yeah, y'know the ah, the girlfriend I told you about last night?
(Hes frantically throwing the cushions off of the couch looking for her other shoe)
Well it turns out she ah, she wants to get back together with me. Oh, I found it!!
Chloe  Thats so great for you guys!
Ross  Yeah!
Chloe  Good luck, with your girlfriend.
Ross  Oh, thank you. (She goes to kiss him, but he holds her coat up between
their faces to stop her.) Hey, hey. (opens the door, sees Rachel, and hides Chloe behind
the door) Rachel!!!!
Rachel  Hi. Ohhh, you got my message.
Ross  Yeah, oh hey, you are right on time.
Rachel  So what do you say? Can I be your girlfriend again?
Ross  Yes, you can, very much.
Ross  (seeing the thumbs up) Ahhhh!! (Hugs Rachel tighter.)
[Scene  Monica and Rachel's, Rachel has just found out about Chloe and is screaming at
Ross.  The rest of the gang is trapped in Monica's bedroom.]
Rachel  (opening the door) Y'know what, I want you to leave! Get outta here!
Ross  No!!
Rachel  Just get out! Now!!
Ross  No!! No!! I wanna stay. I wanna talk about this.
Rachel  Okay! All right! How was she?
Chandler  Uh-oh.
Ross  What?
Rachel  Was she good?
Joey  Dont answer that.
Rachel  Come on Ross! You said you wanted to talk about it, lets talk
about it!! How was she?
Ross  She was...
Joey  Awful! Horrible!
Chandler  She was not good. Not good.
Joey  She was nothing compared to you.
Ross  She, she was different.
Joey  Ewwwww!
Chandler  Uh-oh.
Rachel  Good different?
Ross  Nobody likes change.
Ross  What? Okay, okay, okay, okay.
[Scene  Rachel's bedroom, Rachel, entering selfish mode, is thanking Ross for wrongly
taking the entire blame of the breakup; as if she had absolutely nothing to do with it.]
Rachel   ...the way you owned up to everything, it just showed me how much
youve grown. Y'know?  I mean my Mom never thought this would work out.
It was all, Once a cheater, always a cheater.  Ooh, I just wish we
hadnt lost those four months, but if time was what you needed just to gain a little
perspective...
Ross  WE WERE ON A BREAK!!!!!!!
[Scene  A mailbox, Ross is mailing the invitations.  He throws a bunch into the
mailbox, but pauses with Rachel's.  And it starts another round of clips.]
[Scene  The hallway, Rachel is convincing Ross that Emily is good for him.]
Rachel  You seem to really like her.
Ross  Yeah, I really do. Yeah, but what am I gonna do, I mean we-we both agreed
that it was gonna be a two-week thing, yknow no commitment.
Rachel  Ross, that girl just spent the entire evening talking to your friends,
asking to hear stories about you, looking through Monicas photo albums, I mean you
dont do that if youre just in it for two weeks.
Ross  You think?
Rachel  Yeah, you got like 14 hours until she has to be at the airport, and
youre sitting here in the hallway with a 28-year-old cheerleader with a fat lip.
Ross  Hey, youre right.
Rachel  Yeah.
[Scene  Monica and Rachel's, Joey, Monica, and Phoebe are opening their invitations.]
Monica  Ohh, this is soo amazing! I cant believe my brothers getting
married! And in London! Its so romantic!
Joey  (taking apart the invitation) Hey, pretty smart! Tissue paper! Youre
at the wedding, you have to cry, "Handkerchief?" "No-no, I got my
invitation."
Phoebe  Oooh look! Isnt this adorable, Ross let Ben address mine!
Chandler  (entering) Hello!
Joey  Hey!
Monica  Hey!
Phoebe  Hey! Hey, did you get your invitation to Rosss wedding?
Chandler  (sarcastic) Noo.
Joey  Dont worry man, I get to bring a guest. Well show him.
Phoebe  Im so jealous youre all going! I cant believe I never
knew that you cant fly in your third trimester!
Chandler  I didnt know that.
Monica  I never knew that either.
Joey  I knew that! (They all look at him) I sooo didnt know that, but you
should see your faces.
Rachel  (entering) Hey guys! Whats up?
Joey  Heyyy. (They all try and hide their invitations.)
Monica  Were hanging out.
Rachel  Whats this? Is this Rosss wedding invitation?
Chandler  See, maybe thats the one we shouldve actually hidden.
Rachel  Oh, no! No you guys! Come on, you dont have to do that! Im
happy for him! I am! I reallyIm-Im happIll work on it.
Monica  Im sorry honey.
Rachel  Yeah.
Monica  Rach, youre gonna come though arent you?
Rachel  Oh, honey, I dont know. I
Chandler  This isnt one of those uh, yknow "If she doesnt
come, we-we dont, we dont come?" Right? Because I already bought my
ticket
Monica  You know what would be real weird? Is if you werent there. Just
say youll think about it, okay?
Rachel  No, Ill think about it. Yeah.
[Scene  Monica and Rachel's, it's Rachel birthday party and Chandler is about to spill
the beans.]
Rachel  Who's this from?
Chandler  Oh, that's Ross's.
Rachel  Oh... (opens it and sees it is a pin) Oh my God. He remembered.
Phoebe  Remembered what?
Rachel  It was like months ago. We were walking by this antique store, and I saw
this pin in the window, and I told him that it was just like one my grandmother had when I
was a little girl. Oh! I can't believe he remembered!
Phoebe  Oh, it's so pretty. This must have cost him a fortune.
Monica  I can't believe he did this.
Chandler  Come on, Ross? Remember back in college, when he fell in love with
Carol and bought her that ridiculously expensive crystal duck?
Rachel  What did you just say?
Chandler  (stuttering incoherently) F-hah.... flennin....
Rachel  Oh.... my God.
[Scene  The airport, Ross is about to walk off of the plane with Julie.]
Rachel   (seeing Ross come off the plane with another woman.) Oh my God.
[Scene  Monica and Rachel's, Ross is introducing Julie to the gang.]
Julie  Well, Ross and I were in grad school together.
Ross  But we haven't seen each other since then. Well I land in China, guess
who's in charge of the dig.
Rachel  Julie! Julie, isn't that great? I mean, isn't that just kick-
you-in-the-crotch, spit-on-your-neck fantastic?
[Scene  Monica and Rachel's, Ross is trying to hang up on Julie.]
Ross  Oh, that is so sweet.(listens) No, no, ok, you hang up. Ok, ok, one, two,
three.(He doesn't hang up and motions for Rachel to be quiet.) Well you didn't hang up
either.
Rachel   She didn't hang up either...
Ross   Ok, no, no, you hang up. You, you, y(Rachel grabs the phone
and hangs it up for him.)
Rachel  (on phone) Ross, hi, it's Rachel. I'm just calling to say that um,
everything's fine and I'm really happy for you and your cat...(cut)...I
am over you. I am over you and that, my friend, is what they call closure. (She hangs up
and tosses phone in the ice bucket.)
Ross  Rach, I got a message from you.
Rachel  Oh my God. Oh my God Ross, no, hang up the phone, give me the phone
Ross, give me the phone, give me the phone, give me the. . . (She jumps the couch and
lands on Ross's back, finally getting the phone from him. Ross has a confused expression
on his face.)
Ross  You're over me?
Rachel  Ohhhhhhhh God. (climbs off his back)
Ross  Wha... you're uh, you're, you're over me?
Rachel  Ohh, ohh.
Ross  When, when were you... under me?
Rachel  Well, basically, lately, I've uh, I've uh, sort of had feelings for you.
Ross  OK, I need to lie down.
[Scene  Chandler and Joey's, Ross has just broken up with Julie and is about to get
with Rachel.]
Joey  He broke up with Julie. Well, go hug her, for god's sakes.
Rachel  Really?
Ross  Really. It's always been you, Rach.
Rachel  Oh, god.
Chandler and Joey  Ohhh.
[Scene  The Auditorium, Ross and Rachel are about to... you know.]
Ross  I've no idea, could be. Listen, I'm sorry I had to work tonight.
Rachel  Oh it's OK. You were worth the wait, and I don't just mean tonight.
Rachel  Ah, oh God. Oh, honey, oh that's OK.
Ross  What. Oh no, you just rolled over the juice box.
[Scene  Central Perk, Ross is trying to prevent Gunther from spilling the beans.]
Ross  Gunther! Gunther. Gunther, please tell me you didnt say anything to
Rachel about me and the girl from the Xerox place.
Gunther  Im sorry. Was I not supposed to?
[Scene  The beachhouse, Ross and Rachel are argueing about the breakup.]
Ross  Y'know, hey! Youre the one who ended it, remember?
Rachel  Yeah, because I was mad at you, not because I stopped loving you!
Ross  You still love me?
Rachel  Noo.
Ross  What does this mean? What do you, I mean do you wanna, get back together?
Rachel  Noo! Maybe! I, I dont know.
Ross  What?!
Rachel  I just, I feel, I-I just...
[Scene  Monica and Rachel's, Rachel and Ross are finally breaking up for good, or is
it?]
Rachel  Y'know I cant believe I even thought about getting back
together again! We are so over!!
Ross  (starts to cry) FINE BY ME!! (he opens the door and traps Chandler behind
it)
Rachel  And hey! Just so you know, its not that common! It doesnt
happen to every guy! And it is a big deal!!
Chandler  I KNEW IT!!!!
[Scene  Central Perk, Rachel is deciding on whether or not to go to the wedding.]
[Scene  Monica and Rachel's, the gang is watching the Prom Video and Rachel is about to
make her entrance on the video.  The italics are portions of the prom video.]
Mrs. Geller  Rachel's coming up the path.  Doesn't she look
pretty. Jack... (Rachel enters with a huge nose)
Rachel  Oh my God.
Monica  You know what this is, this is us getting ready for the prom.
Rachel  Oh.
Ross  You know what, you guys, we don't have to watch this.
All  Oh yeah we do. C'mon.
Mrs. Geller  Get a shot of Monica. Where's Monica.
Mr. Geller  Wait, how do you zoom out? (zooms out and we see an
extremely overweight Monica eating a big sandwich) There she is.
Monica  Shut up, the camera adds ten pounds.
Chandler  Ahh, so how many cameras are actually on you?
Monica  Oh, dad, turn it off.
Mr. Geller  It is off.  Right Ross? (pans over to see Ross with
an afro and moustache)
Joey  Lookin' good Mr. Cotter.
Rachel  I can't go to my own prom without a date, I can't, it's too
late.
Monica  If you're not going then I don't want to go either.
Mrs. Geller  (to Ross on the stairs) I have a wonderful idea. You
should take Rachel to the prom.
Ross  Y'know what?  I think we've seen enough, let's turn it off.
All  No, no, no.
Ross  OK, fine, well I'm not gonna watch, alright.
Mr. Geller  C'mon kid, let's go.
Mrs. Geller  Ahh, are you hadsome.
Mr. Geller  Let's show 'em.
Ross  (walks down the stairs and grabs the flowers out of the vase on
the endtable) Okay dad.
Mr. Geller  (going downstairs) Rachel, ready or not, here comes your
knight in shiningOh no. (Chip has shown up and the four are leaving.)
Rachel, Monica, Roy, and Chip  Bye.
Mrs. Geller  Oh, dear. Jack, how do I turn this off?
Ross  Yeah, well.
Phoebe  See, he's her lobster.
Monica  (seeing the decision) Nooooo. Youre really not going?
Rachel  Yeah. Its just gonna be too hard. Yknow? I mean, its
Ross. How can I watch him get married? Yknow its just, its for the best,
yknow it is, its Yknow, plus, somebodys got to stay here
with Phoebe! Yknow shes gonna be pretty big by then, and she needs someone to
help her tie her shoes; drive her to the hospital in case she goes into labour.
Monica  You dont have a car. And your license expired.
Rachel  I know. (Starts to cry) Yeah, see, theres so much to do and I have
so little time to do it in.
[Scene  Central Perk, Chandler, Joey, and Phoebe are reading a book about things to do
whilst in London.]
Chandler  All right, check it out. Check this out. It says here that
theres a place you can go to rent videos of all the museums! (Reading from the
book.) "Its almost as good as being there."
Joey  Its better! You cant go to a museum in your underwear!
Chandler  Well, You could, but... probably just the one
time.
Joey  I bet we could get videos of all the sites, get a VCR in our
hotel room... we'd never even have to go outside!
Chandler  If we do that, we gotta get Die Hard.
Joey  Oh-ho! I bet the British version is gooooood!

[Scene  Central Perk, the gang is there, Phoebe is returning from the bathroom.]
Phoebe  (angrily) Thats like the tenth time Ive peed since Ive
been here!
Monica  Thats also like the tenth time you told us.
Phoebe  Yeah, oh Im sorry, it must be really hard to hear! I tell ya,
its a lot easier having three babies play Bringing in the Noise, Bringing in da Funk
on your bladder! Im so sick of being pregnant! The only happiness I get is from a
cup of coffee, which of course is decaf, causeOh! Im pregnant!
Ross  Pheebs, didyou want a cookie?
Phoebe  (starting to cry) Thank you so much.
Rachel  So uh, Pheebs, honey, how are those mood swings coming?
Phoebe  I havent really had any yet.
[Scene  Chandler and Joey's, Joey and Chandler are there as Ross enters.]
Ross  Hey guys!
Chandler  Hey.
Joey  Hey!
Ross  All right, heres the ring. (Shows Chandler the wedding ring he plans
on giving Emily)
Chandler  (shocked) Yes! Yes! A thousand times, yes!
Ross  So uh, any ideas for the bachelor party yet?
Joey  Whoa-whoa-whoa! Before you start handing out wedding rings and planning
bachelor parties, dont you have to decide who your best man is gonna be?
Chandler  Oh, its awkward. Its awkward. Its awkward.
Ross  I sortve already asked Chandler.
Joey  What?! He got to do it at your first wedding!
Ross  Joey, I figured youd understand. I mean, I-Ive known him a lot
longer.
Joey  Come on Ross! Look, I-I dont have any brothers; Ill never get
to be a best man!
Chandler  You can be the best man when I get married.
Joey  (pause) Ill never get to be a best man!
Ross  (to Chandler) Wait-wait, so, you get to be my best man twice and I never
get to be yours at all?
Chandler  Oh no-no-no, youyeah, of course you get to be my best man.
Joey  (impatiently tapping Chandler on the shoulder) What about me?! You-you
just said I could!
Chandler  Im not even getting married! Okay, this is a question for
science fiction writers!
Joey  I cant believe youre not picking me.
Ross  Hey, how can it not be me?!HeyHey!
Chandler  Im not even Im not even
Ross  Fine, yknow what, thats it. From now on, Joey, I want you to
be my best man.
Joey  Yes! (to Chandler) Shame about you man.
[Scene  Monica and Rachel's, Monica, Rachel, and Phoebe are eating breakfast.]
Phoebe  (to her babies) Stop it!
Monica  What?
Phoebe  One of the babies is kicking.
Monica  I thought that was a good thing.
Phoebe  Its not kicking me, its kicking one of the other babies. Oh
(looks down her dress)! Dont make me come in there!
Joey  (entering) Hey!
Monica  Hey!
Joey  Do you guys have like a big bowl I can borrow?
Monica  Yeah, theres one right under the cabinet.
Joey  (grabs it) Thanks.
Monica  Why do you need it?
Joey  Oh, were having a big party tomorrow night. Later! (Starts for the
door.)
Rachel  Whoa! Hey-hey, you planning on inviting us?
Joey  Nooo, later. (Walks out the door.)
Phoebe  Hey!! Get your ass back here, Tribbiani!! (Joey walks back in, scared.)
Rachel  Hormones!
Monica  What Phoebe meant to say was umm, how come youre having a party
and were not invited?
Joey  Oh, its Rosss bachelor party.
Monica  Sooo?
Joey  Are you bachelors?
Monica  Nooo!
Joey  Are you strippers?
Rachel  Nooo!
Joey  Then youre not invited. (Starts for the door again.)
Rachel  All right fine! Youre not invited to the party were gonna
have either.
Joey  Oh-whoa, what party?
Rachel  Well umm
Monica  The baby shower for Phoebe!
Joey  Baby shower. Wow! That sounds sooo like something I dont want to do!
Later! (Finally, he makes his exit.)
Phoebe  I cant believe Im gonna have a party! This is so great!
(Really excited) A party! (Really, really excited) Yay!! (Suddenly, she starts crying and
Rachel moves to comfort her.) I dont know why.
[Scene  Central Perk, Joey and Ross are talking over party plans.]
Joey  This is what Ive got going for the party so far, liquor wise. Get a
lot of liquor.
Ross  Great. Great.
Joey  Okay, now uh, in terms of the invite list, Ive got you, me, and
Chandler and Im gonna invite Gunther cause, well, weve been talking
about this pretty loud.
Gunther  Ill be there.
Joey  All rightoh! Listen, I know this is your party, but Id really
like to the number of museum geeks that are gonna be there.
Ross  Yeah. Tell ya what, lets not invite any of the anthropologists, only
the dinosaur dudes!
Joey  Okay! Well need a six-pack of Zima.
Chandler  (entering) Hey guys, what are you doing?
Ross  Oh, just planning my bachelor party with my best man.
Chandler  Yeah, well, good luck trying to top the last one.
Ross  Yeah, see, I dont think its gonna that difficult considering
this one wont be taking place in the basement of a Pizza Hut.
Chandler  Oh, Im Ross. Im Ross. Im too good for the Hut;
Im too good for the Hut.
Ross  Look, I gotta go pick up Ben. Everything so far sounds great Joey, just
remember to keep it on the mellow side, okay? Just a couple of guys hanging out playing
poker, no-no strippers or anything okay?
Joey  You got it.
Ross  Okay, see ya later.
Chandler  See ya. (Ross exits, and Chandler moves over next to Joey, laughing.)
Have fun planning your mellow bachelor party.
Joey  Well, theres gonna be strippers there. He didnt say anything
about no strippers.
Chandler  He just said, "No strippers."
Joey  Oh, I chose not to hear that.
[Scene  Monica and Rachel's, Monica is returning from shopping and Rachel is there.]
Monica  Look what I got! Look what I got! Look what I got! (She shows Rachel
what she bought. She bought a little leather jacket and a little cowboy outfit for the
babies.) Can you believe they make these for little people?
Rachel  Little village people.
Monica  Okay, look at this one. This is my favourite. (Its a little pink
and white dress for the girl baby.)
Rachel  Oh, that is so sweet!
Monica  I know! Phoebe is gonna love dressing them in these!
Rachel  Huh. Except, Phoebes not gonna be the one that gets to dress them.
Monica  Because shes not gonna get to keep the babies.
Rachel  Oh my God! We are throwing the most depressing baby shower ever!
Monica  Wait a minute! Unless, we give her all gifts she can use after
shes done being pregnant. Like-like umm, regular coffee, Tequila.
Rachel  Oh, and somebody can get those leather pants shes always wanted!
Monica  Oh, shes gonna love that!
[Scene  Monica and Rachel's, Phoebes baby shower, she is holding those leather
pants, and isnt happy about it.]
Phoebe  What the hell is this?! What, did you actually thought it would make me
feel better to give me stuff that I cant use for another two months?! This sucks!
All right, whats my next present?!
All 
[Scene  Chandler and Joey's, Rosss bachelor party. Ross is thanking Joey for the
party.]
Ross  Hey listen man, about the stripper

a little announcement. Ive decided that my best man is, my best friend Gunther!
Gunther  Whats my last name?
Chandler  Central Perk?
Gunther  (to Ross) Thanks for not marrying Rachel. (He starts to leave.)
Joey  Oh-whoa-wait, Gunther dont-dont forget your shirt. (He gives
Gunther his shirt and Gunther leaves.)
Ross  Hey-hey, what are those?
Joey  Oh, little party favours, check it out! (Its a shirt that reads,
"Ross Geller, Bachelor Bash 1998")
Ross  Wow! Yeah!
Joey  Oh-oh! (Shows him whats on the back, "Best Man Joey Tribbiani,

stripper) so is the position of the bride.
The Stripper  Great!
Ross  Smooth man. Yeah, you got some chilie on your neck. (Chandler checks and
runs into the bathroom.) Well, I just want to say, thanks everyone, this-this was great.
And hey! See you guys Monday morning. (They museum geeks wave at him.) Thanks Joey.
Joey  Oh, hey, dont forget your shirt.

Joey  Okay, hey, museum geeks, partys over. Okay. Wave bye-bye to the nice
lady. There you go. Back to your parents basement. All right. (The museum geeks exit
and Joey unlocks his door and lets the chick and the duck out.) Come on boys, come on out!
Here you go. All right.
The Stripper  Ohhh, look at the little birdies! Are those yours?
Joey  Yeah!
The Stripper  Wow, I didnt know they let you keep chickens and ducks as
pets.
Joey  Oh yeah-yeah. And I got the duck totally trained. Watch this. Stare at the
wall. (The duck complies.) Hardly move. (The duck complies.) Be white. (The duck
complies.)
The Stripper  You are really good at that. So uh, I had fun tonight, you throw
one hell of a party.
Joey  Oh thanks. Thanks. It was great meetin ya. And listen if any of my
friends gets married, or have a birthday, or a Tuesday
The Stripper  Yeah, that would be great. So I guess umm, good night.
Joey  Oh unless you uh, you wanna hang around.
The Stripper  Yeah?
Joey  Yeah. Ill let you play with my duck.
[Scene  Joeys bedroom, its the middle of the night, hes waking up and
discovers hes alone in bed.]
Joey  Hey, (realises he doesnt know her name.) stripper! (He notices that
the ring box is open, so he picks it up, sees its empty and starts to panic.)
[Scene  Chandler and Joey's, its continued from earlier. Joey is now waking
Chandler and telling him the news.]
Joey  (running and banging on Chandlers door) The stripper stole the
ring!! The stripper stole the ring!! Chandler! Chandler, get up! Get up! The stripper
stole the ring!
Chandler  (opening the door) What?
Joey  The ring is gone!
Chandler  Ugh. Just a sec, give me a minute to wake up for thisAh-ha-ha!!
You lost the ring! Youre the worst best man ever!
Joey  Dude, this isnt funny! What am I gonna do?! I go to bed last night,
everythings cool! I wake up this morning, the strippers gone and the ring is
gone!
Chandler  You slept with the stripper?
Joey  Of course!! (Shrugs.)
[Scene  Central Perk, Phoebe is entering, Monica and Rachel are talking on the couch.]
Phoebe  Hi, guys.
Rachel  Hi! Phoebe. (Both Monica and her try to move out of Phoebes way.)
Monica  Hi Phoebe.
Phoebe  I-I wanted to apologise if Iyknow seemed a tad edgy
yesterday at my shower. Yknow its just the hormones, yknow.
Rachel  No we
Monica  Hormones.
Rachel  hormones, yeah.
Phoebe  Anyway, I just wanted to say thank you, it was just, it was so sweet.
(She goes to hug them and they both flinch, thinking that Phoebe is about to attack them.)
Monica  Wow, you seem to be doing so much better. Thats great. So how-how
are things going?
Phoebe  Good. Yknowno-no, okay, its-it feels like
everythings been about me lately, so whats happening with you?
Rachel  Oh, well, actually we were just talking about me not going to
Rosss wedding.
Phoebe  Oh!
Rachel  It just might be too hard, given the history and all that
Phoebe  Wow! This reminds me of the time when I was umm, living on the street
and this guy offered to buy me food if I slept with him.
Rachel  Well, h-how is this like that?
Phoebe  Well, lets see, its not. Really, like that. Because, you see
that was an actual problem, and uh, yours is just like yknow a bunch of
yknow high school crap that nobody really gives yknow
Rachel  (starting to cry) Im-Im sorry, I just thought that
Phoebe  Alrighty, here come the water works. (Rachel starts crying harder.)
[Scene  Chandler and Joey's, Joey is trying to figure out what to do.]
Joey  Ugh! I dont know what Im going to do! I called the company
that sent and th-they dont care! Then I called 9-1-1 and they laughed at me, if this
isnt an emergency, then what is?
Ross  (entering) Hey guys!
Chandler  Hey!
Joey  Hey
Ross  I just wanted to thank you again for last night, what a great party! And
the guys from work had a blast. Yknow, one of them had never been to a bachelor
party before. Yeah! And-and another one had never been to a party before, so
Joey  So uh, hey, that uh, that wedding ring, huh? Man, thats nice!
Ross  Yeah, right!
Joey  I was uh, I was thinking I might want to pick one of those babies up for
myself, I might want to get one of those
Ross  That ring? When my grandmother first came to this country, that ring and
the clothes on her back were all she had with her.
Chandler  So you might say, the ring is irreplaceable? (Gives Joey a little
squeeze.)
Ross  Oh absolutely! It has been in my family for generations, and every bride
who has worn it has had a long and happy life.
Chandler  So you might say, its a magic ring.
Joey  (laughs, softly) Yeah, the stripper stole it.
Ross  My-my ring? My-my wedding ring? The-the stripper stole my wedding ring?!
H-how?! How could this all happen?!
Chandler  Well, I think it all started when you said, "Hey Joey, why
dont you be my best man."
Ross  (dialling the phone) All right-all right, fine! I-Im gonna call the
cops!
Joey  Dude, I screwed up, you dont have to turn me in!
Ross  Not on you! On the stripper!
Joey  Oh, yeah, well I already did that! They said theyre gonna look into
it right after they solved all the murders.
Ross  Okay, well, well call the company that sent her!
Joey  I did that too! They wouldnt give me her real name or her number.
They said, "If I bothered them again theyd call the police." I said,
"If you talk to the police, you tell them Im missing a ring!"
Ross  So what, Joey? Wh-wh-what? What are you telling me? That theres
nothing we can do? Well, how could this happen?!
Joey  Look Ross, I am so-so sorry. I-I-I
Chandler  Well, what if we just ah, called her, used a fake name, and had her
come to my office?
Joey  Oh, that sounds like fun, but weve got a ring to find!!
[Scene  Monica and Rachel's, Monica and Rachel are cautiously serving Phoebe some tea.]
Monica  Heres your tea Phoebe. (They give it to her and quickly take a
step back.)
Phoebe  (sips it) Its so good. (Monica and Rachel breath a sigh of
relief.) Oh, thanks.
Rachel  Good.
Monica  Im so glad you liked it.
Phoebe  (sets the cup down) Oh! (Grabs her stomach in pain.)
Monica  What?!
Rachel  What?! She made the tea! (Points to Monica.)
Phoebe  Oh! No, I-I think I just had a contraction.
Rachel  You what?
Monica  Oh my God!
Phoebe  Yeah, I thought I had one a couple of minutes ago, and now I know that
was definitely one.
Monica  Wait, you cant have the baby here! I mean I havent
sterilised it since the guys moved out!
Rachel  Okay. Its okay. Were gonna be okay. Yknow what?
Its okay. Im gonna, Im gonna, Im gonna boil some water and just
rip up some sheets!
Phoebe  No. Its all right; its probably false labour. They said
that, that can happen near the end, just somebody get the book.
Monica  Rachel, get the book! The book!
Rachel  Okay! (Runs and grabs a book and hands it to Monica.) Okay! Here!
Monica  The Bible?!
Rachel  I dont know!
[Scene  Chandlers office, the guys are there waiting to ambush the stripper.]
Joey  All right, okay, this is great, uh, Chandler, you get behind the desk.
And-and when she comes in hopefully, she wont recognise you because, well, why would
she? Uh, okay, and then you buzz Ross and I. (to Ross) You be Mr. Gonzalez, and Ill
be uh, Mr. Wong.
Ross  Diverse.
The Stripper  Did anybody call for security?
Chandler  (to Ross) You be cool. (He opens the door and lets her in as they all
turn there backs on her.)
The Stripper  Okay, which one of you guys is Gunther Central-Perk? (Sees Joey.)
Hey, Joey?
Ross  Wheres my ring? My dead grandmothers wedding ring? Where is
it? Where is it?
Chandler  Way to be cool, man.
The Stripper  Whats he talking about?
Joey  There was a ring, in a box, on my nightstand, after you left, it was gone!
The Stripper  Wait, you guys think I stole some ring?
The Guys 
Ross  We know you took so just-just save yourself the time and confess!
The Stripper  Okay, who are you? The Hardy boys? Look, I dont need to
steal some stupid ring, all right? I make $1,600 a week doing what I do; any of you guys
make that?
Chandler  Marry me. (Both Ross and Chandler hit him.)
[Scene  Chandler and Joey's, the guys are now trying to figure out what next to do,
since their plan with the stripper backfired on them.]
Joey  I dont get it! It was in my room all night! And if she didnt
take it, and I didnt take it; and you (Chandler) didnt take it, then who did?
(The duck quacks.) Shh! Were trying to think! (Ross and Chandler realise it at the
same moment and stare at Joey, who doesnt get it. After a short pause, with the duck
still quacking, Joey figures it out and starts pointing at the duck.)
[Scene  Monica and Rachel's, Phoebe is recovering from her false labour.]
Rachel  I still dont get how you know when its false labour.
Phoebe  Well, do you see any babies?
Monica  How do you feel?
Phoebe  Okay, I guess. I mean I dont know, its just, I guess I
know its going to be over soon.
Rachel  Well, isnt that a good thing? You said you were sick of this.
Phoebe  I know. Its just yknow usually when youre, when
youre done with the pregnant thing, yknow, then you get to do the mom thing.
Im gonna be yknow, sitting around in my leather pants, drinking Tequila.
Monica  Some moms do that.
Phoebe  Okay thats even sadder. Look, I know, I know what I got myself
into, its just that now that theyre in me its like, its like I
know them yknow, I mean-I mean, its just not gonna be easy when these little
babies have to go away.
Monica  Aww, sweetie, but its not like youre not gonna have
anything. Youre gonna have nieces and nephews, and some ways thats even
better.
Phoebe  Yeah, okay.
Rachel  No, really. Really, Pheebs, youre not gonna be the one worrying
about saving for college, or yelling at them when theyre bad, yknow, or
deciding to put them on Ritalin when they just wont calm down. Yknow?
Monica  I mean, youre the one theyre gonna come to when they wanna
run away from home, and the one they talk to about sex.
Rachel  And you just get to be cool Aunt Phoebe!
Phoebe  Cool Aunt Phoebe. I am pretty cool!
Monica  Yeah.
Rachel  And yknow what else, oh my God, are they gonna love you.
Phoebe  They are gonna love me.
Rachel  Oh!
Phoebe  Thanks you guys! Again.
Monica  Oh, sweetie! (They all hug.)
Phoebe  Youre the best. Thanks. Oh!
Monica and Rachel 
Phoebe  Just kidding. Ahh!
Rachel  What?!
Monica  Oh my God!
Phoebe  Got cha again, you guys are so easy.
[Scene  The Animal Hospital, the guys have taken the duck in to remove the ring. Joey
is pacing around like an expectant father.]
Joey  If anything should happen to him
Ross  Joey! The vet said its a simple procedure.
Joey  So! Things can go wrong! You dont know! What if he doesnt make
it?!
Chandler  He will, Joe.
Joey  Yeah, but what if he doesnt? Hes such a good duck.
Joey  Im so worried about him, yknow?
The Doctor  (coming in from surgery) Somebody lose a ring?
Ross  Oh my God! Thank you! Thank you so much! (He grabs the ring, kisses it,
and then does a double-take realising where its been.)
Joey  H-h-h-hows the duck?
The Doctor  Hes doing just fine, hes resting now, but you can see
him in a little bit.
Joey  Ohh, great! Oh hey, listen Ross, thanks for being so cool about this.
Ross  No, thats all right.
Joey  No, its not. I mean you-you made me your best man and I totally let
you down!
Chandler  Hey, come on, its not your fault.
Joey  Yeah, it is! You wouldnt have lost the ring, right? Yknow
what, Ross you were right from the start, he (Chandler) should be your best man.
Chandler  No, you should.
Joey  Now, dont argue with me
Ross  Hey! Hey! Hey! I get to choose my best man, and I want both you
guys.
Chandler  Really?
Joey  Really?
Ross  Hey, both you guys should be up there with me. I mean, you two are-are
my I mean, Im lucky to have just one good (They all start getting
emotional.)
Chandler  Thanks man.
Joey  (starting to cry) I gotta go check something over here. (He walks away so
that they cant see him cry.)
Chandler  What a baby.
Ross  Total wuss!
[Scene  Chandler and Joey's, Joey and Chandler are getting ready for the flight to
London and Monica comes running in.]
Monica  Guys, hurry up! The flight leaves in four hours! It could take time to
get a taxi! There could be traffic! The plane could leave early! When we get to London,
there could be a line at customs! Come on!! (She runs back to her apartment.)
Chandler  Six-hour trip to London. Thats a lot of Monica.
Monica  Passport, check! (As she puts away each item, she says check.) Camera,
check! Travellers cheques, check!
Rachel  Who are you saying "check" too?
Monica  Myself. Yknow for remembering to pack a thing. Yeah, you do a good
thing, you get a check! (pause) My mom does it, I never realized it was weird.
Phoebe  Yeah, my mom used to put her head in the oven. Well, actually, she only
did it the one time. But it was pretty weird.
Ross  (entering) Hey!
Monica  Hey!
Ross  Hey! Are you ready yet?
Monica  Yep! You got the tickets?
Ross  Oh! Got em right here, (Pats his coat pocket) check!
Joey  Its all London, baby! Here we go. (He takes a picture of a less than
enthused Chandler and starts towards the girls apartment.)
Chandler  You got your passport?
Joey  Yeah, in my third drawer on my dresser. You dont want to lose that.
Joey  Ohh!! (Runs to his room.)
Chandler  There it is.
[Scene  Monica and Rachel's, continued from earlier, Monica is telling Phoebe where
everything is.]
Monica  Okay, if you need the vacuum, its in my closet on the left-hand
side. Ah, the garbage bags are next to the refrigerator
Phoebe  Okay, okay, but Rachels gonna be here too, cant I just ask
her this stuff?
Monica  Yeah, okay, give that a try!
Chandler  (entering, with Joey) All right! Lets do it!
Joey  Woo-hoo!!
Ross  Yeah, cheerie-o!
Joey  London baby!
Chandler  Okay, cause thats not gonna get annoying.
Joey  (louder) London baby!!
Chandler  Hey, yknow what? I was wrong.
Ross  Well, were all here! I guess we should get going!
Phoebe  Ohhh, I wanna come over there and give you a hug and wish you luck on
your wedding, but I dontcant get up.
Ross  Oh, Ill-Ill come hug you.
Phoebe  Great! Yeah, could you bring me the newspaper?
Ross  Yeah. (He does so and Phoebe hugs him.)
Phoebe  Oh, have a great wedding!
Ross  Thanks.
Phoebe  Oh, hey, Chandler I wanna hug you too!
Chandler  Hey! (Trots over)
Phoebe  Oh, and great! You might as well bring me my book, its on the
counter in your apartment.
Chandler  Oh. (Goes and gets Phoebes book as Rachel comes in from her
room.)
Ross  (to Rachel) So, were off.
Rachel  Have fun!
Ross  Thanks! (They hug.) Ugh, I cant believe youre not gonna be
there!
Rachel  Oh, I know.
Ross  So-so come! Why dont you come?
Rachel  What?!
Ross  To London! Come to London. Please? Itll mean so much to me.
Rachel  Yeah, well, I gotta work, Im sorry.
Ross  Why-why cant you take a couple of days off?
Rachel  Because, I cant! Ross, I told you, no. I cant.
Ross  This is my wedding.
Monica  All right, yknow what? We really are late! Lets go!
Lets go! Lets go!!
Ross  Fine. Youll-youll watch it on video when we get back.
Chandler  (entering, with Phoebes book.) Here you go Phoebe! Here you go
Phobo! Phewbedo! Phaybobo.
Phoebe  (laughs) Thank you.
Phoebe  Thank you. (She pats him on his head.)
Ross  All right, lets go! Bye, Pheebs!
Joey  Bye, Pheebs!
Joey  London baby!! (And Rachel slowly closes the door, sadly.)
Phoebe  Oh, do you need a hug? You dont have to bring me anything!
[Scene  Street in front of the London Marriott, Joey and Chandler exit. Joey is
carrying a video camera and is shooting Chandler.]
Joey  Come on! Do something!
Chandler  I am, Im ignoring you.
Joey  Okay, here! (Gives him the camera.) I wanna be the on camera guy. All
right, first stop, Westminster Abbey. (Joey folds out his "pop-up" map of
London. All of the major landmarks pop-up like in a pop-up book.)
Chandler  Oh, what the hell is that?
Joey  Its London, baby! All right, the hotels here. (Points to the
map.) Wait. No, we wanna go No. I know. (Sets the map down.) Im gonna have to
go into the map. (So Joey literally steps into the map.)
Chandler  Okay, if you see a little version of me in there? Kill it!
Joey  I got it! (Picks up the map and starts walking.) Here we go.
Chandler  Okay. Listen-listen, were not gonna have to walk this way the
entire time are we?
Joey  Shhh! (Pause) Man, you made me lose it! (He goes into the map again.)
[Scene  Another street, somewhere along the River Themes, Ross, Emily, and Monica are
walking to where theyre gonna get married. Emily is relating the troubles with the
caterer.]
Emily  and that was all before 10 oclock. The caterer rang and said
it was going to be Chicken Kiev instead of Chicken Tarragon. And then the florist phoned
to say there arent any tulips. Oh, and the chilliest has carpel-tunel syndrome.
Were not gonna be
Ross  Whoa-whoa-whoa! Emily, (Gives her the time-out signal.) honey, okay?
Emily  Well, up yours too!
Ross  What?! No! No! Thats-thats time-out!
Emily  Sorry.
Ross  Sweetie, you gotta relax. Everythings gonna be great, okay? Come on.
Come on.
Monica  Chicken Kiev?
Ross  Um-hmm! Doesnt that sound delicious at the last minute?
Monica  Yeah, yknow, but something like salmon which would be so much more
elegant than the chicken. And, you wouldnt have to worry about the salmonella. (Ross
pushes her.) So, I cant wait to see this place youre getting married!
Ross  Yeah. Yeah. Yes, this place is beautiful. Emilys parents got married
here.
Emily  I still cant believe theyre tearing it down. It really is the
most lovely building youll ever see. I mean its over (She stops
suddenly, when she sees that demolition has already started.) Oh my God!
Monica  Its nice.
Emily  Oh. Oh. (She starts running towards the building.)
Emily  (running in, with Ross) Oh. Oh my God. How can this be happening? What
are we going to do?
Ross  Its all right! Everythings gonna be all right.
Emily  Hows it gonna be all right?!
Ross  Uh-huh, I see that.
Monica  (entering) Okay, I talked to the guy with the shovel and I found out
what happened.
Ross  What? What?
Monica  They torn it down a few days early.
[Scene  Westminster Abbey, Joey and Chandler have successfully navigated the streets of
London and are approaching the Abbey.]
Joey  All right! Westminster Abbey! Hands down, best Abbey Ive ever seen.
Hey! (Pushes Chandler in front of the camera.) Okay. What do you think of the Abbey,
Chandler?
Chandler  I think its great. Its great. Yknow, theyre
thinking of changing the name of this place.
Joey  Really? To what?
Chandler  To Put the Camera Away!!!
Joey  Man, you are Westminster Crabby. (He starts chasing Chandler
towards the Abbey.)
[Scene  Monica and Rachel's, Phoebe is trying to move off of the couch as Rachel
enters.]
Phoebe  Oh. Oh.
Rachel  Oh, honey! Dont get up! What do you need?
Phoebe  Oh, no. Oh, nothing.
Rachel  Come on! I am here to take care of you! What do you need? Anything.
Phoebe  Okay, I have a wedgie.
Rachel  Okay, that is all you.
Phoebe  So-so, what do you want for lunch?
Rachel  Oh, I dont know. I guess we have to eat.
Phoebe  Yeah, I do. Whats the matter?
Rachel  Im just bummed about the way I left things with Ross. I
shouldnt have lied to him about having to work. He seemed so mad at me.
Phoebe  Eh, dont be so hard on yourself. If someone I was still in love
with was getting married
Rachel  (interrupting) Still in love with?!
Phoebe  Yeah!
Rachel  Im not in love with Ross!
Phoebe  Oh. No. No. Good! Yeah, me neither.
Rachel  Phoebe, Im going to Rosss wedding because he is my
ex-boyfriend and that would be really uncomfortable. Not because, Im still in
love with him! I mean, hey, yknow, I like Ross as much as the next guy, yknow?
Clearly I have feelings for him, but feelings dont mean love! I mean, I still
have loving feelings for Ross. Yeah! But, I have, I have continuing feelings of love, but
that doesnt mean that-that Im still in love with him. Yknow? I-I have
sexual feelings for him, but I do love himOhh! Oh my God! Oh mywhy
didnt you tell me?!!
Phoebe  We thought you knew!
Rachel  We?!
Phoebe  Yeah, we all know! We talk about it all the time!
Rachel  You all know? Does Ross know?
Phoebe  Oh no, Ross doesnt know anything.
Rachel  Oh, I can not believe you didnt tell me!
Phoebe  Well, because we thought you knew!! Its so obvious! God, that
would be like telling Monica, "Hey, you like things clean."
[Scene  A park in London, Joey and Chandler walk up to a souvenir stand.]
Joey  Hey!
The Vendor  So, what are you guys in the market for? Weve got uh, scarves,
tulip post cards...
Joey  Check this out? Huh? (Joey has this big tall hat with a British flag on
the front of it.) Yeah. Thats the stuff. What do you think?
Chandler  Well, I dont have to buy that, "Im with stupid"
T-shirt anymore.
Joey  Well, I like it. Here you go. (He pays for the hat.)
Chandler  All right, look, youre not really gonna buy that are you?
Dont you think youve embarrassed me enough for one day?
Joey  Oh, I embarrass you?
Chandler  How can I answer that when Im pretending I dont know you?
The Vendor  Hes just jealous. Youll fit right in; all Londoners wear
them!
Chandler  Oh really? Then how come no one here is wearing them?
The Vendor  (looks around) Theyre all tourists.
Chandler  All right, look, if you insist on wearing that, in public,
yknow, youre gonna spend the rest of the afternoon all by yourself.
Joey  Oh yeah? (Puts the hat on.) If youre gonna make me choose between
you and the hat? I choose the hat.
The Vendor  Good choice.
Joey  Thanks.
Chandler  Okay, wait. All right, thats it, okay, Im out of here. I
am not going to be embarrassed anymore! (He trips over a box, falls into a flower stand
and walks away trying to be cool.)
[Scene  The hotel, Rosss room, Emily is entering.]
Emily  Hello?
Ross  Hey! I just spoke to your dad, and you know what? He seems to think
well be able to find a new place for the wedding.
Emily  We dont have to.
Ross  Whoa-whoa-what? You found a place?
Emily  No. But, Monica and I were talking, and-and I was so upset about the hall
being knocked down, and she suggested that we put the wedding off for a bit.
Ross  She said what?
Emily  She said, "If Im not gonna be happy getting married somewhere
that we find in a day, well then we should just postpone it."
Ross  Postpone it? Emily, do you think Monica realises how much our parents
spent on this wedding? Do you my sisters teeny-tiny little brain comprehends that
people took time out of their lives to fly thousands of miles to be here, huh? (He puts
his pants on backwards.) This isnt right.
Emily  I realize that people are going to be disappointed. But, Im sure
theyll come back when we can do it right.
Ross  I cant ask people to do that? Would you ask people to do that?
(Holds out his pants)
Emily  Dont you point your pants at me! (She throws them on the floor.) We
have no choice! Anywhere thats half-decent wouldve be booked months ago, Ross
dont you understand? This is our wedding Im talking about.
Ross  The only thing I understand is; postponing it is not an option. This is
when were getting married.
Emily  So what are you saying? Its now or never?
Ross  No. Im saying its now. (He starts putting on his pants,
backwards again.)
Emily  Or?
Ross  Theres no or in mind. What is wrong with these pants?!!
Emily  Its not the pants. Its you that is backwards. And if, and if
you dont understand how important this is to me, well then, perhaps we
shouldnt get married at all! (She storms out.)
Ross  (chasing her, trying to zip up his pants. His got them on right now.) No,
wait! Emily! No, wait, stop! Emily, please(He catches something important in the
zipper and howls like a little boy and falls to the floor.)
[Scene  Monica and Rachel's, Phoebe is on the couch as Rachel returns carrying a bunch
of shopping bags.]
Phoebe  Hey!
Rachel  (depressed) Hi.
Phoebe  So, did shopping make you feel any better about Ross?
Rachel  Manhattan does not have enough stores.
Phoebe  Well, I think I can help you get over him.
Rachel  You can?
Phoebe  Yeah. I just need you to bring me some photos of Ross.
Rachel  Um-hmm.
Phoebe  And a small piece of chocolate.
Rachel  Okay.
Phoebe  And a glass of tepid water. (She gathers up all of these things.)
Rachel  Ooh, is this one of those things where you throw it in a bag with some
graveyard dirt and hang it from a north-facing tree?
Phoebe  Uh, only if you have the hiccups too. Yeah, the pictures are for you,
the water and the chocolate is for me. I just didnt feel like getting up. Okay,
Im gonna show you a picture of Ross. Okay? And youre going to remember all of
the bad things about him. All right? Really focus on his flaws.
Rachel  I can do that. I certainly did it when we were going out.
Phoebe  Okay. Umm, before we get started, I just wanna say for the record that I
love Ross, I think hes such a great guy. Here. (Hands her the picture, Rachel grabs
it out of her hand.) Okay, now, close your eyes. And imagine that youre with Ross
okay and imagine that youre kissing him. And youre-youre running your
hands all over his body. And then you run your hands through his hair, but eew-oh gross
its some kind of grease, itsuck! Hah?
Rachel  I dont know, his uh, his hair never really bothered me that much,
and yknow it was always more crunchy than it was greasy.
Phoebe  Okay, this is going to be harder than I thought. Umm, lets try
some uh, aversion therapy.
Rachel  Okay.
Phoebe  Okay?
Rachel  All right.
Phoebe  So uh, now look at the picture
Rachel  Okay.
Phoebe  All right, and umm (She grabs the picture and smacks her in the
head.)
Rachel  Ow!
Phoebe  Okay, how do you feel now?
Rachel  Well, I like you less!
[Scene  Chandler and Joeys hotel room. Chandler is watching TV as Joey returns,
still wearing his hat.]
Joey  Hey.
Chandler  Hey. (He nods at the hat.)
Joey  Oh. (Takes off the hat.) Sorry!
Chandler  No-no-no, yknow what? I really shouldnt have said that you
were embarrassing me, I mean that really wasnt cool. And if it makes you feel any
better, Ive had a really lousy day.
Joey  Me too.
Chandler  Yeah?
Joey  Noo!! Ive had the best day ever! Dude, check this out!
Monica  (entering) Hey!
Joey  Sh-shh-shh! (He motions for her to watch something he has taped.)
Joey  (on tape) Okay, so say hi to my friend and tell him that you like the hat.
Fergie  (Yep, Sarah, the Duchess of York) Okay, so umm, whats your
friends name?
Joey  (on tape) Oh, Chandler.
Fergie  Hi Chandler! (Waves)
Chandler  Thats Thats was
Monica  Oh my God!
Joey  Thats Fergie baby!!
Fergie  Joey says you dont really like his hat, but I think its
kinda dashing.
Chandler  How did you? How? How?
Joey  Well, I was trying to figure out how to get to Buckingham Palace, right?
So, Im in my map and-and(Ross enters) Hey!
Monica  Hey!
Ross  Hi. I understand you had a little talk with Emily.
Monica  (laughs) Yes, I did! And you are welcome!
Ross  Am I?! And was it your idea to postpone the wedding?!
Monica  Umm
Chandler  Im gonna go to the bathroom.
Joey  Wait up! (They both run to the bathroom.)
Ross  Hey-hey, since youre the fix-it lady, heres a
pickle, what do you do when the bride says she doesnt want to have the wedding at
all?
Monica  She said that?!
Ross  Yeah.
Monica  Why?!
Ross  I dont know, I told her it was stupid to put off the wedding just
because the hall was gone and she liked flipped out.
Monica  Oh my God. Youre even dumber than I am!
Ross  Excuse me?
Monica  Ross, how long have you been planning this wedding?
Ross  I dont know. A month?
Monica  Emily has probably been planning it since she was five! Ever since the
first time she took a pillowcase and hung it off the back of her head. Thats what we
did! We dreamed about the perfect wedding, and the perfect place, with the perfect
four-tiered wedding cake (Starting to cry), with the little people on top. (Ross gets
thrown a box of Kleenex from the bathroom and he gives her one.) Thanks. But the most
important part is that we had the perfect guy who understood just how important all that
other stuff was.
Ross  I had no idea. And that-that pillowcase thing, I thought you guys were
just doing the flying nun.
Monica  Sometimes we were.
Ross  Come on. You gotta help me figure out what to do. Okay?
Monica  Okay.
Ross  Come on. (They leave and Chandler sticks his head out.)
Chandler  That was pretty intense huh?
Joey  Yeah. (Pause) Hey, I hope Ross didnt think that we just went in
there because we were uncomfortable being out here!
Chandler  (glares at him) I hope he did!
[Scene  Monica and Rachel's, the phone rings and Phoebe answers it.]
Phoebe  Hello.
Joey  (on phone) Hey, Pheebs! Its Joey!
Phoebe  Hey, Joey! Hey! Ooh! Ooh! I just say someone on thethat looks just
like you on the subway. And I was gonna go over and say hi! but then I
figured, he doesnt care if he looks like you.
Joey  That just cost me four bucks. But uh listen, I just called to see how the
chick and the duck are doing?
Phoebe  Ohh, theyre having a great time with their Aunt Phoebe!
Aunt Rachel hasnt been helpful at all. So, do you miss me?
Joey  Kinda, but Ive just been having way too much fun.
Phoebe  So youre not homesick yet?
Joey  No, I dont think so.
Phoebe  All right, the seven of us miss you.
Joey  Whos seven?
Phoebe  Yknow, me, Rachel, the birds, the babies
Joey  Ahh, the babies miss me?
Phoebe  Ooh, the pizza guys here!
Joey  What? You ordered pizza without me?!
Phoebe  Yeah. But yknow we were thinking about you, yknow we ordered
the Joey Special.
Joey  Two pizzas?!
Phoebe  Yep! Okay, gotta go, talk to you later.
Joey  Wait, well, where did you get it from?!
[Scene  Ross and Emilys planned wedding place, Monica is dragging Emily in.]
Emily  Monica, why have you brought me here of all places?!
Monica  Youll see.
Emily  I tell you, this wedding is not going to happen.
Emily  Oh God.
Ross  Okay? But-but imagine a lot more lights, okay? And-and yknow fewer
bricks, and-and-and flowers, and candles
Monica  And the musicians, look, they can go over here (Points to a little
alcove), okay? And the chairs can face this way (Points), and (Points to Ross) You
go.
Ross  But-but, if you dont love this, well do it in any other place
at any other time. Really, its fine, whatever you want.
Emily  Its perfect.
Ross  And, I dont know, if it starts to rain
Emily  Well then well get wet. (They kiss.)
Monica  Ohh. And I dont even have a date.
[Scene  Monica and Rachel's, Rachel is in her bedroom.]
Rachel  Pheebs?
Phoebe  Yeah?
Rachel  Do you remember where the duck food is?
Phoebe  Yeah, its in the guys apartment under the sink. Why?
Rachel  (enters with a bag packed) Because Im going to London.
Phoebe  What?! What do you mean youre going to London?
Rachel  Yeah, I have to tell Ross that I love him. Now honey, you take care, you
dont have those babies until I get back. (Kisses her stomach.)
Phoebe  IRachel, you cant go! Ross loves Emily!
Rachel  Yeah, I know, I know, I know he does. But I have to tell him how I feel!
He deserves to have all the information and then he can make an informed decision.
Phoebe  Thats not why youre going! Youre going because you
hope hes gonna say, "Yeah, I love you too, Rach. Forget that British
chippy."
Rachel  OhhDo you think he will?!
Phoebe  No! Because hes in love with the British chippy! Look, Rachel, if
you go, youre just gonna mess with his head and ruin his wedding! Yknow,
its too late! You missed youre chance! Im sorry, I know this must be
really hard, its over.
Rachel  Yknow what? No. Its not over until someone says, "I
do." (Exits)
Phoebe  I do! I do! I do! (Chases her into the hall, but Rachel doesnt
stop.) I do! (Gives up.) Ugh, like I can really chase you. Im carrying a litter.
