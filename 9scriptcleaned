[Scene  Rachels Room, Joey moves Rosss coat to get the tissues Rachel wants
and the engagement ring box Mrs. Geller gave him falls out of the pocket it was inside.
Joey goes to one knee, picks up the box, opens it, and sees that its an engagement
ring.]
Rachel  Joey.
Rachel  (seeing the ring) Oh my God. (Pause) Okay.
Rachel  So uhI guess we shouldmake it official huh?
Joey  Uh Look Rach(Ross enters.) Hey Ross is here! Hey look!
Its my good friend Ross. Hey Ross.
Ross  Hey Joey. (To Rachel) Hey you.
Rachel  Hey you.
Joey  Hey and look he brought flowers. Thanks Ross, but Im really more of
a candy guy. (Laughs.)
Ross  Youre weird today. (He turns to Rachel and Joey puts the ring back.)
(To Rachel) Listen I uh, wanted to talk to you about something.
Rachel  Uh yeah, actually I kinda need to talk to you too.
Ross  Uh Joey, can you give us just a minute?
Joey  No.
Ross  What?
Joey  Oh, Im sorry. I meant no.
Monica  (entering with everyone else including Mr. Geller) Hi! Hey look
whos here!
Mr. Geller  Wheres my granddaughter? Ive been practicing my magic
tricks.
Chandler  He pulled a quarter out of my ear!
Ross  Hey, wheres uh, wheres mom?
Mr. Geller  She went to pick up Aunt Liddy.
Monica  Oh, Aunt Liddys coming? That means we get five dollars each!
Mr. Geller  So when do I get to meet Emma and show her this? (Pulls a bouquet of
flowers out of his sleeve.)
Chandler  Okay. Wow.
Ross  Uh Dad, Emmas in the nursery. Ill take you now. If you want,
but (To Rachel) I really want to talk to you.
Rachel  I know, I still need to talk to you.
Joey  Oh hey but, before you guys do that (To Rachel) I need to talk to you, and
Ross, I need to talk to you.
Phoebe  (To Monica) Oh and I need to talk to you.
Monica  About what?
Phoebe  To see if know what these guys are talking about.
[Scene  Outside the Nursery, everyone but Rachel is standing and looking into the
window.]
Monica  Isnt she beautiful?
Mr. Geller  Look at her, my first grandchild.
Ross  What about Ben?
Mr. Geller  Well of course Ben, I meant my first granddaughter. (To Monica,
mouths) Wow.
Phoebe  (taking Ross aside) Have umm, have you thought anymore about you and
Rachel?
Ross  Oh well yeah, actually I was going to talk to her when you guys all came
in the room.
Phoebe  Yay! Its so exciting! Wow, you couldve done that with us
there.
Ross  Yeah right.
Phoebe  Oh sure okay, you can touch yourself in front of us but you cant
talk to Rachel.
Ross  What?! When have I ever touched myself in front of you guys?
Phoebe  Oh please! Just before when you were asleep in the lounge! That Armenian
family was watching you instead of the TV. Oh, that reminds me. That Mr. Hasmeje still has
my Gameboy.
Joey  (taking Chandler aside) Hey Chandler, can I talk to you for a second?
Chandler  Sure.
Joey  Dude I just did something terrible.
Chandler  That was you?! I thought it was Jack!
Joey  No! No, that was Jack! Rachel thinks I asked her to marry me!
Chandler  What?! Why does she think that?
Joey  Because it kinda looked like I did.
Chandler  Again, what?!
Joey  Okay well, I was down on one knee with the ring in my hand
Chandler  As we all are at some point during the day.
Joey  It wasnt my ring! It fell out of Rosss jacket! And when I
knelt down to pick it up Rachel thought I was proposing!
Chandler  Ross had a ring?! And he was gonna propose?
Joey  I guess.
Chandler  And you did it first?! This is gonna kill him! You know how much he
loves to propose!
Joey  I know! I know its awful.
Chandler  Well, what did she say?
Joey  (happily) She said yes.
Chandler  Does Ross know?
Joey  Oh God, what the hell am I going to tell him?
Chandler  Well maybe you dont have to tell him anything.
Joey  Oh, I like that. Yeah
Chandler  If you clear things up with Rachel then Ross never needs to find out,
but you have to do it now before he hears about it and kicks your ass!
Joey  (laughs) Now lets not get carried away. (He walks away as Monica
comes over and hugs Chandler from behind.)
Monica  I want a baby.
Chandler  Honey, weve been over this. I need to be facing the other way.
Monica  Come on! Come on, if we have sex again itll double our chances of
getting pregnant. Do you think that closets still available?
Chandler  Im so tired. (She starts kissing him.) Yeah okay, but no
foreplay.
Monica  Deal!
Ross  Dad seriously! Yknow you really should see someone about that!
Mr. Geller  Noted.
Ross  I wanna go talk to Rachel for a minute, are you gonna be okay alone for a
bit?
Mr. Geller  Are you kidding me, I could stay and look at her forever.
Ross  (noticing something) Actually umm (He turns Mr. Gellers head
to look at Emma.)
[Scene  Rachels Room, Phoebe is entering.]
Phoebe  Hey!
Rachel  Hi.
Phoebe  Are you all right?
Rachel  Uhh I think I just got engaged.
Phoebe  Oh my God! He did it?
Rachel  Welldid you know he was gonna ask me?
Phoebe  Are you kidding? Im like the one who talked him into it. I like to
think of myself as the puppet master of the group.
Rachel  And you really think this is a good idea?
Phoebe  I just talked him into it, dont tell me I have to do you too. The
puppet master gets tired people.
Rachel  I just dont know! It just doesnt feel right.
Phoebe  Why?! You two are so meant to be together, everybody thinks so.
Rachel  Really?! Even Ross?
Phoebe  Especially Ross!
Joey  (entering) Oh uh, hey Pheebs. Uh yknow what? Ill-Ill
come back later. (He goes to leave but runs into Ross whos entering.)
Ross  Wow! Kind of uh, kind of a full house here. Ill guess
justIll come back. (Ross exits followed by Joey.)
Phoebe  There he goes, your fiancée.
Rachel  I guess so.
Phoebe  Although he does play with himself in his sleep.
Rachel  I cant say that Im surprised.
[Scene  A hallway, Joey and Ross find Mr. Geller with his ear up against a
janitors closet door.]
Ross  Dad, what are you doing?
Mr. Geller  I think there are people in there having sex.
Joey  It cant be me, Im standing right here.
Mr. Geller  Wanna peek?
Ross  No!
Mr. Geller  Come on!
Ross  Yknow what? I dont like you without mom. (To Joey) Come on.
(Walks away.)
Joey  (To Ross) Were not peeking? (Follows him.)
Mr. Geller  Well Im peeking. (He peeks.) Oh my God!
Chandler  Hello sir, you know Monica.
[Scene  Rachels Room, she is taking the ring out of Rosss jacket, looks at
it, and puts it on her finger as Joey enters.]
Joey  Hey uh, is it okay to come in?
Rachel  Of course! Oh Joey, this ring Iits beautiful I love it!
Joey  Yeah uh look Rach, theres something I gotta tell ya.
Rachel  Hey!
Nurse  Hey! Are you ready to try nursing again?
Rachel  Yeah! Hi Emma. Hey, why do you think she wont take my breast?
Nurse  Its all right honey, it takes some babies a while to get it, but
dont worry. Itll happen.
Joey  (watching) Yowsa! (Looks away.)
Rachel  Okay sweetie, you can do it. Just open up and put it in your mouth.
Joey  Dear Lord.
Rachel  Im sorry honey, what were you saying?
Joey  Oh uh-uh yeah, I think that
Rachel  Oh look, shes pulling away again! Do you think my nipples are too
big for her mouth? (Joey gets embarrassed.) She looks scared. Doesnt she look
scared?
Joey  Yknow, I dont really know her.
Nurse  Why dont we try massaging the breast to stimulate the flow. (Does
so.)
Joey  (To God) Are you kidding me?!
Rachel  Its just so frustrating! Why doesnt she want my breast?!
Joey  I dont know! Maybe shes crazy! (Storms out.)
[Scene  The Lobby, Ross is eating a sandwich as Phoebe rushes up to him.]
Phoebe  Oh hey! Wait up!
Ross  Hi!
Phoebe  Congratulations! I didnt want to say anything in front of Joey
cause I didnt know if he knew yet.
Ross  What, that we had a baby? Come on lets give him a little credit,
although, he did eat a piece of plastic fruit earlier.
Phoebe  No! No, that you and Rachel are engaged!
Ross  What?
Phoebe  Oh, its a secret. Oh goodie! Yes! We havent done the secret
thing in a long time.
Ross  Phoebe, there is no secret. Okay? I didnt propose.
Phoebe  Are you lying? Is this like that time you tried to convince us that you
were a doctor?
Ross  (pause) I am a doctor! Yknow what? Im just gonna go and
talk to Rachel myself.
Phoebe  All right, me too. (They go into her room and see that shes
sleeping.) Should we wake her up?
Ross  No! No, come on let her sleep! Shes so exhausted.
Phoebe  And so engaged. (Points to the ring that Rachel is wearing.)
Ross  What? (Motions for Phoebe to go outside with him.) Oh my God! She-she
thinks were engaged! Why? Why? Why would she think were engaged?!
Phoebe  Perhaps because you gave her an engagement ring? Yknow Ross
doctors are supposed to be smart.
Ross  I didnt give her that ring!
Phoebe  Really?
Ross  No!
Phoebe  So whose ring is it?
Ross  Its mine.
Phoebe  Is it an engagement ring?
Ross  Yes!
Phoebe  But you didnt give it to her?
Ross  No!
Phoebe  But you were going to propose?
Ross  No!!
Phoebe  Huh, I might be losing interest in this.
Ross  Look. Look, my mom gave me that ring because she wanted me to propose to
Rachel, but all I wanted to do is if she maybekindawanted
ahstartthings up again.
Phoebe  Oh, what beautiful lukewarm sentiment.
Ross  Look, I didnt want to rush into anything. And it seemed like she
didnt want to either. But I dont, I dont understand how any of this
happened! What? Did she find the ring in my jacket, assume that I was going to propose,
throw it on, and-and just start telling people?
Phoebe  No! No, she said you actually proposed to her.
Ross  Well I didnt! I didnt propose! (Pause) Unless uh (Pause)
Did I? I havent slept in forty hours andit does sound like something I would
do.
[Scene  The Janitors Closet, Chandler and Monica are trying to figure out what to
do now.]
Chandler  Look, we cant stay in here forever.
Monica  Oh, I still cant believe my dad saw us having sex! He didnt
make it to one of piano recitals, but this he sees!
Chandler  This is okay. Were all adults here; theres nothing to be
ashamed of. Now, lets put our underwear in our pockets and walk out the door. (They
do so and find Mr. Geller leaning against a wall stunned.)
Monica  Hi Dad! I can still call you that right?
Mr. Geller  Of course. Ill always be your dad.
Chandler  I just want you to know that what you witnessed in there, that
wasnt for fun.
Monica  It wasnt fun?!
Chandler  (To Monica) Why? Why-why-would youWh-why (To Mr. Geller)
Look, I just dont want you to think that were animals who do it whenever we
want.
Mr. Geller  Oh, I dont think that. Before today I never thought of you two
having sex at all. It was a simpler time.
Monica  The truth is, Dad, were-were trying.
Mr. Geller  What?
Monica  Yeah, were trying to get pregnant.
Mr. Geller  Oh my God! This is so exciting! Well, get back in there! (Points to
the closet) Ill guard the door!
Monica  Well, thats okay dad, we-we can wait until later.
Mr. Geller  Whoa-whoa-whoa! I dont think so! Arent you ovulating?
Monica  Daddy?!
Mr. Geller  Well you gotta get at it princess! When your mother and I were
trying to conceive you, whenever she was ovulating, bam, we did it. Thats how I got
my bad hip.
Chandler  Thats funny, this conversations how I got the bullet hole
in my head.
Mr. Geller  This one time I had my knee up on the sink and your mother, she
was
Monica  Daddy! I dont think we need to hear about the specific positions
you and mom had sex.
Mr. Geller  Youre right, youre right. This is about your positions.
Now, what I saw in the closet is not the optimum position for conceiving a child, although
it might feel good.
Monica  I dont feel good right now.
Mr. Geller  But pleasure is important, (To Chandler) and it helps if the woman
has an orgasm. You up to the task sailor?
Chandler  Seriously sir, my brains? All over the wall.
[Scene  Rachels Room, Monica is entering.]
Monica  Hey.
Rachel  Hey. I need to tell you something.
Monica  Well, nows a good time. Im on my way to have my ears cut
off.
Rachel  Joey asked me marry him.
Monica  What?
Rachel  Joey proposed to me.
Monica  Is he crazy?! You just had Rosss baby!
Rachel  Well, I-I said yes.
Monica  What?! Are you crazy? You just had Rosss baby! Its-its
so inappropriate. No, its worse than that. Its wrong. Its It is
bigger than mine! (Rachels engagement ring.)
Rachel  I know. Days of Our Lives, thank you very much.
Monica  You cant marry him!
Rachel  Why not? I dont want to do this alone! And hes such a sweet
guy and he loves me so much.
Monica  Well do you love him?
Rachel  Sure.
Monica  Sure?
Rachel  Yeah, I mean whatever.
Monica  Honey, the question isdo you really want to marry Joey?
Rachel  No. No, I dont. Could you be a dear and go tell him?
[Scene  A Hallway, Chandler is following Joey.]
Chandler  You still havent told Rachel you werent really proposing?
Joey  No! She had the ring on, she seemed so excited, and then she took her
breast out.
Chandler  Joey, you have to tell her whats going on! And what did it look
like?!
Joey  I didnt look at it. Stupid babys head was blocking most of it.
Chandler  Go and tell Rachel right now before Ross finds out.
Joey  Look, its not that easy. She said she wanted to marry me. I
dont want to hurt her.
Chandler  Okay, look, just do it gently.
Joey  Youre right. Youre right. I-Ill go tell her now before
Ross finds out and Ill be gentle. I can do that. I am a gentle person. Oh, by the
way. Two people screwing in there (Points to the closet Chandler and Monica were in) if
you want to check that out.
[Scene  Rachels Room, Ross is entering.]
Ross  Hey.
Rachel  Hey.
Ross  Listen, I um I heard about the engagement.
Rachel  Surprised?
Ross  And confused. Rach, sweetie, I-I umI didnt propose to you.
Rachel  I know.
Ross  I dont think you do.
Rachel  You didnt propose to me. Joey did.
Ross  Poor baby, youre so tired. Rach, I didnt propose to you, Joey
didnt propose to you, and Chandler didnt propose to you.
Rachel  Uh You didnt propose to me, Chandler didnt propose to
me, but Joey did.
Ross  Joey proposed to you?
Joey  I can come back.
Ross  Hey, wait! Wait-wait-wait! Joey, did you propose to her?
Joey  No.
Rachel  Yes you did!
Joey  Actually, technically, I didnt.
Rachel  Well then why did you give me a ring?
Ross  Wait! Whoa-whoa, youyou gave her the ring?
Joey  No! No, and I did not ask her to marry me!
Rachel  Yes, you did!
Joey  No, I didnt!
Rachel  Yes, you did!
Joey  No, I didnt!
Rachel  Yes, you did! And dont you say, "No, I didnt!"
Joey  Ahhh!
Rachel  He was right there. He got down on one knee and proposed.
Ross  Whoa! You were down on one knee?
Joey  Yeah. Yeah, that looks bad. But I didntI didnt propose!
Ross  Then what did happen?
Rachel  Yeah, what did happen?
Joey  Okay, the ring fell on the floor and I went down to pick it up and you
thought I was proposing.
Rachel  Yeah, but you said, "Will you marry me?"
Joey  No, I didnt!
Rachel  Yes, you did!
Joey  No, I didnt!
Rachel  Yes, you didOh my God you didnt! (Screams) Well then why
didnt you tell me that before?!
Joey  Well I tried, but people kept coming in and then you took your breast out!
Ross  Whoa! Hey! Whoa-whoa-whoa, you saw her breast?!
Joey  (To Ross) Ill tell you about it later. Be cool.
Rachel  Well then Joey, what the hell were you doing with an engagement ring?!
Joey  It wasnt my ring! Its Rosss ring! Thats why I felt
so bad Rach, because he was going to propose.
Ross  What?!
Rachel  You were gonna propose to me?
Ross  Uhh No.
Joey  Well, this is awkward. {See? I told you so.}
Ross  But I-I was going to see if yknow, maybe you uh, start dating again
but thatI mean that-that was all, Rach.
Joey  Dude, step up! I proposed.
Ross  No, you didnt!
Joey  Oh thats right. Theres a lot going on here and I think I ate
some bad fruit earlier.
Nurse  Hey, she just woke up! Shes hungry. Why dont we give this
another try?
Rachel  Okay.
Ross  (To Joey) I cant believe you told her I was going to propose!
Joey  I cant believe youre not going to propose!
Ross  Hey, Im not going to rush into anything!
Joey  Oh yeah, dude, I totally understand. Usually after I have a baby with a
woman I like to slow things down!
Rachel  Oh my God!
Ross  What?
Rachel  Shes doing it Look, shes breast-feeding look!
Joey  (looking at the ceiling) Ah, its beautiful.
Nurse  Ill come back for her later.
Rachel  Okay.
Ross  Thank you. (The nurse exits.)
Rachel  Oh wow, this feels weird.
Ross  Good weird?
Rachel  Wonderful weird.
Joey  Yknow what you guys? Im uh, Im gonna go too. And uh,
Im sorry about everything.
Rachel  Honey dont worry, it was my mistake.
Joey  No, Rach, I shouldve told you sooner. Its just thatMan!
That kid is going to town! (Joey makes his awkward exit.)
Rachel  Shes perfect.
Ross  Were so lucky.
Rachel  We really are.
Ross  Look, I-I know its not a proposal and I dont know where you
are, but with everything thats been going on and with Emma andIve been
feeling
Rachel  I know. I know. Ive feeling
Ross  Yeah?
Rachel  Yeah. (Laughs nervously)
Ross  Okay, well, that Wow, okay, well, ummthen maybe, at least we
can, we can talk about us again.
Rachel  Yeah, maybe.
Ross  Well good, okay. I-I, kind of think yknow if weif
Youre wearing the ring.
Rachel  Wh-whats that?
Ross  And you told Phoebe you were engaged.
Rachel  Im sorry, what?
Ross  When you thought Joey proposed diddid you say yes?
[Scene  Outside the Janitors Closet, there are people having sex and Mr. Geller
is trying to give them some pamphlets.]
Mr. Geller  Kids, I spoke to a doctor and picked up this pamphlets on how to get
pregnant. (He slides them under the door.)
Monica  (walking by with Chandler.) Hey dad!
Chandler  Hey.
Mr. Geller  (pause) Sorry to bother you again, but could you pass my pamphlets
back? (They do so.) Thank you.
[Scene  Rachels Hospital Room, Ross is sitting next to Rachel.]
Ross  You said youd marry Joey?
Rachel  Okay you have to realize, I was exhausted, I was emotional, I would have
said yes to anybody. Like that time you and I got married! (Pause) Im not helping.
Ross  So you said yes to him, and you just had our baby?
Rachel  That is right and traditionally the daddy is supposed to give the mummy
a present but I am prepared to let that go.
Ross  So when I came in here to see if you wanted to maybe start things up
again, you were engaged to my best friend.
Rachel  WellReally? I thought Chandler was your best friend.
Ross  Well, Chandlers my oldest friend, but Joeys myNo! Ah!
(points at Rachel)
Rachel  Ooooo!
Joey  (Enters) Hey you guys Im gonna take off. I just wanted to let you
guys know, say goodbye.
Ross  Rachel said shed marry you?!
Joey  (He looks around the room) This isnt the right room, sorry folks.
(leaves)
[Scene  Ross and Rachels, Monica, Phoebe, Joey and Chandler are waiting for Ross
and Rachel to come home and Monica is looking at the sign Phoebe bought that says,
"Its a Boy!"]
Monica  Ok, I dont wanna be negative so Ill say that most of the
signs you bought are good.
Phoebe  No they ran out of "Its a girl" but I can fix this one,
(She writes "not" in between its and a) See?
Monica  (looking at Chandler sleeping with a balloon in his mouth) So sexy.
(Waking him up.) Honey.
Chandler  Yea yea. (Pulls the balloon out of his mouth)
Monica  Honey why dont you go lie down.
Chandler  No, no, Ross and Rachel will be back soon and then I gotta go to the
office (Pulls another balloon out of his mouth) Am I producing them?
Joey  Whyre you so tired?
Chandler  Couldnt sleep last night you know, then I started worrying about
this big divisional meeting that I have later today, the more I worried about it the more
I couldnt sleep.  Yknow? I was like, if I fall asleep now Ill get
six hours sleep, but if I fall asleep now Ill get five hours sleep. Not matter what
I did I couldnt fall asleep.
Joey  You know what you shouldve done, you should have told yourself that
little story.
Rachel  (enters with Emma) Hi!
Everyone  Hi, welcome home!
Monica  Phoebe did the signs!
Rachel  Oh you guys thanks for doing this.
Phoebe  Look at all the stuff people sent!
Rachel  Oh Ah! (Sees a big stuffed gorilla) Oh my gosh theres something
every mother needs, a giant stuffed gorilla that takes up the entire apartment! What are
people think (Reads the card) Oh you guys I love it.
Joey  Hey so wheres Ross?
Rachel  Hes downstairs getting the rest of the stuff out of the cab.
Joey  Is he still mad at us?
Rachel  Well, you more then me, but he cant stay to mad at me. I mean, I
just had his baby.
Joey  Thats not fair! I cant do that.
Rachel  Yeah, Im not so sure you should be here when he comes up.
Joey  See this is what I was afraid of, I didnt think I should be here
either but somebody (Looks at Chandler) said hed be over it by now.
Chandler  Hey, what do I know? I wanted to get a bigger gorilla.
[Scene  A Boardroom, Chandler keeps drifting off to sleep at his meeting.]
Ms. McKenna  The numbers we are seeing New York, Chicago, and London are
consistently solid, but many of our officers have reported disappointing fields.
Ms. McKenna  Boston is down, Atlanta is down, Houston is down, I could go on and
on but instead of boring you Ill go straight to my forty two point plan.
Chandler  Walter (nods).
[Scene  Ross and Rachels, Phoebe, Monica, Ross, and Rachel are watching Emma
sleep.]
Phoebe  Shes just so cute! I just wanna bite her ear off and use it and a
sucking candy.
Monica  Phoebe! But I could take one of those little feet and put it in a pita
pocket.
Ross  (enters from the bed room) Okay I put most of the stuff away.
Rachel  Oh great, the pacifiers?
Ross  In the closet.
Rachel  The burping clogs?
Ross  Linen closet.
Rachel  The diapers?
Ross  In the hospital.
Phoebe  Wow you guys got a hospital?  Fancy!
Ross  No I left the diapers at the hospital! Theres some in the bag but
Ill run out and get some more.
Rachel  Alright thanks, oh Ross could you stop by the coffee house and get me a
muffin?
Ross  Sure what kind?
Rachel  Umm let me think...What do I want, what d-o I w-a-n-t...
Ross  Please take your time, its an important decision. Not like, say, I
know! deciding to marry someone, this is about a muffin.
Rachel  Blueberry.
Ross  Blueberry it is.
Rachel  Thanks.
Monica  Wow, hes really not letting this go, is he?
Rachel  God how long do you think thats gonna last?
Phoebe  I dunno, well he got over the "We were on a break" thing
really quickly.
Rachel  Yknow I cant even worry about that right now, cause I got
the cutie little baby, oh I cant believe how much I love her, I cant get
enough of her, like right now I miss her.  I actually miss her.
Phoebe  You know thats thats her.
Rachel  Oh god look at her sleeping.  Oh, I love her so much!  Oh, I
think Im gonna wake her up.
Phoebe  Oh no, Rach, no no, you know youre never supposed
to wake a sleeping baby.
Rachel  Well I can do whatever I want!  I made her! (Waking Emma up.) Come
on little girl, hi!
Phoebe  I can say I told you so but shes kinda doing that for me.
Rachel  Oh Im sorry mummys so sorry go back to sleep go back to
sleep. Shh.   Shhh! Go back to sleep
Monica  Breaks your heart doesnt it
Phoebe  It really does how long do you think we have to stay?
[Scene  A Boardroom, Chandlers meeting continues.]
Ms. McKenna  Ok if everyones on board, its settled, Chandler,
(Walter puts his hand on Chandlers hand, Chandler sleeping puts his hand on top of his, he
then wakes up and pulls his hand away) Chandler?
Chandler  Yep.
Ms. McKenna  Are you on board?
Chandler  (not knowing what hes saying yes to) Yes.
Ms. McKenna  Then, problem solved. Chandler will be running our office in Tulsa.
Youre gonna love Oklahoma.
[Scene  Ross and Rachels, Emma continues crying while Rachel, Monica and Phoebe
try different methods to stop her crying.]
Phoebe  Well, alright, we already tried feeding her, changing her, burping her,
oh try this one! Go back in time and listen to Phoebe!
Monica  Alright heres something, it says to try holding the baby close to
your body and then swing her rapidly from side to side.
Rachel  Ok. (Starts swinging Emma rapidly and she stops crying)
Monica  It worked!
Rachel  Oh (happy) oh no just stopped to throw up a little bit. (Emma starts
crying again.) Oh come on, what am I gonna do, its been hours and it wont stop
crying.
Monica  Umm, she Rach, not it, she.
Rachel  Yeah, Im not so sure.
Monica  Oh my god, I am losing my mind.
Phoebe  Yeah, no kidding, this just proves no good can come from having sex with
Ross!
[Scene  Central Perk, Ross is getting Rachels muffin.]
Ross  Hey Gunther, can I get a couple of blueberry muffins to go? (He puts a bag
with diapers in it on the counter.)
Gunther  Diapers huh?
Ross  Yep.
Gunther  So I guess Rachel had you baby?
Ross  Yep, can you believe it?
Gunther  Nope!  I still cant believe she slept with you in the first
place.
Ross  Huh? Ooh (laughs) you mean like a Huh?
Joey  (entering) Hey. (Ross turns to see who it is, and seeing its Joey he
just ignores him and turns back around.) Ross, I know youre pissed at me, but we
have to talk about this.
Ross  Ah actually we dont. (Ross walks off)
Joey   Fine, fine okay.  But I gotta say technically, I
didnt even do anything wrong.
Ross  (turns back) What! (Angrily) You didnt do anything wrong?!
Joey  I said I didnt technically.
Ross  Okay lets put aside that you (Makes quote marks with his fingers.)
"accidentally" picked up my grandmothers ring and you (Does it again)
"accidentally" proposed to Rachel.
Joey  Look, can I just stop you right there for a second? When people do this
(Makes quote marks with his fingers.) I dont really know what that means. (Ross just
looks at him) You were saying?
Ross  And I can even understand that you couldnt tell Rachel, but why
couldnt you tell me, huh? You had all day to and you didnt.
Joey  I know I shouldve. (Makes quote marks again.) "Im
sorry."
Ross  Not using it right, Joe.
Ross  Im gonna go.
Joey  No, come on Ross! (He grabs his bag so he cant leave) Look, Ross, we
have to get past this.
Ross  Give me the bag.
Joey  No, look, I dont know what else to do. I said Im sorry!
Ross  Joey!
Joey  You should scream at me, or-or-or curse me, or hit me.
Ross  Im not gonna hit you.
Joey  Why not?  Youll feel better!  Ill feel better, and
you know you want to. I can see it in your eyes.
Ross  No I dont.
Joey  A little bit.
Ross  No.
Joey  Little bit.
Ross  No!
Joey  (excited) A little bit more.
Ross  Give me the bag.
Joey  No, hit me
Ross  Give me the bag.
Joey  Hit me.
Ross  Joey, give me the bag.
Joey  Hit me!
Ross  Joe Im not kidding
Joey  (interrupting) Hit me, hit me.
Ross  No!
Joey  (shouts) Hit me! Hit me!
Ross  You ducked!!
Joey  Im sorry! It was a reflex!
Ross  Oh my god, this really hurts!!!
Joey  I couldnt help it! When a fist comes at your face, you duck! Look!
(He goes to punch Ross, expecting him to duck, but he doesnt and Joey punches Ross.
  Gunther is amused.)
Ross  What is the matter with you?!?
Joey  You were supposed to duck!!! Why didnt you duck?
Ross  Why dont we talk about this on the way to the hospital?
Joey  Good, good yeah, (Grabs the bags) maybe while were there, they can
check your reflexes. (Joey opens the door and it hits Ross in the face with it.) (Makes
quote marks.) "Oops."
[Scene  Ross and Rachels, Emma is still crying.]
Monica  Try feeding her again.
Rachel  I already fed her.
Monica  I know, thats why I said again!
Phoebe  Alright you guys, we cant turn on each other, Okay? 
Thats just what she wants.
Chandler  (enters) Hey.
Monica  Hey.
Chandler  Monica can I talk to you outside for a minute?
Rachel  Oh no, you guys, just stay here, Im gonna go check her diaper,
Pheebs you wanna come?
Phoebe  Oh Im kinda part of this.
Chandler  Actually Pheebs its more of a husband and wife kinda thing
Phoebe  I knew I should have married Chandler.
Monica  Okay whats up
Chandler  Umm, you know how we always said that it would be fun to move to Paris
for a year? You know, you could study French cooking and I could write and we could take a
picnic along the Seine and go wine tasting in Bordeaux?
Monica  Oh yeah (smiles).
Chandler  Okay, you know how that people say that Tulsa is the Paris of
Oklahoma?
Monica  What? Who says that?
Chandler  People whove never ever been to Paris.
Monica  Whats going on?
Chandler  Were moving to Tulsa! (Makes a excited expression on his face)
Monica  Excuse me?
Chandler  Okay, Ms. McKenna, she kind of works above my boss, she asked me to
move to Tulsa and be the president of our office there, and I was sleeping and apparently,
said yes.
Monica  (stands up angry) Tulsa, Oklahoma!
Chandler  The Sooner State, whatever that is.
Monica  Chandler, I dont even wanna see the musical Oklahoma!
Chandler  Really? Oh What A Beautiful Morning!  Surrey With A
Fringe On Top.
Monica  Are you trying to tell me that were moving to Oklahoma, or that
youre gay? All right, not that this matters, but did they at least offer you a huge
raise?
Chandler  No, no, but they are going to lease us a Ford Focus. (Monicas
not impressed.) Ill get out of it.
Monica  Thank you.
Chandler  (hears Emma crying) What is wrong with Emma?
Monica  Oh she misunderstood, she thought she was moving to Tulsa.
[Scene  Ms. McKennas Office, Chandler enters.]
Chandler  Umm maam, do you have a minute? (She points for him to come in)
I kind of have some bad news. I dont think I can move to Tulsa.
Ms. McKenna  What?
Chandler  Its a funny story, actually. (coughs) I kind of fell asleep in
the meeting this morning so when I said Id move to Tulsa, I didnt really know
what I was saying.
Ms. McKenna  You fell asleep?
Chandler  But only because I was up all night worried about this meeting,
aint that funny? Irony? Not a fan, alright (he sits down). See, heres the
thing. I went home and told my wife about Tulsa and she wont go. See, me, I love
Tulsa!  Tulsa is heaven!  Tulsa is ItalyPlease dont make me go
there!
Ms. McKenna  Chandler, I
Chandler  No no no! Look, Carol, can I call you Carol? (Pause) Wh-why would I
when your name is Elaine? Oh what a great picture of your son, strapping! (She glares at
him.) Thats a picture of your daughter, isnt it, well shes lovely. I
like a girl with a strong jaw. Ill call you from Tulsa. (Exits.)
[Scene  The Hospital, Joey is sitting in the lobby as Ross enters.]
Joey  Hey, so how is it?
Ross  I broke my thumb.
Joey  Your thumb? Thats weird. (Makes a fist.) You sure youre
punching right? Make a fist. (Ross just looks at him with his thumb in a cast.) Maybe
later. Ross I feel terrible.
Ross  You know what, you can go, I just have to fill out some forms. (Tries to
hold the pen but cant)
Joey  You, you want me to help you with that?
Ross  Why, does it look like Im having trouble with my misshapen claw? (He
hands Joey the form)
Joey  Name? (Ross looks at him.) I know Ross but whats it short for? You
know like, like Rossel or Rosstepher.
Ross  Just Ross!
Joey  Its pretty, Okay date of birth?
Ross  You know my birthday.
Joey  Sure, May...tember.
Ross  October 18th.
Joey  Occupation? Dinosaurs.
Ross  Actually Im a palian Dinosaurs is fine the drawing is
not.
Joey  Alright, who do you want as your emergency contact?
Ross  Ah, Rachel I guess.
Joey  Okay, relationship, boy this could take a while.
Ross  Just ah just put roommate.
Joey  Come on, you guys are more then that! I mean, youre gonna get
together right?
Ross  I dont think that we are.
Joey  But you two were supposed to be together.
Ross  Well, I thought so too, but then she said shed marry you.
Joey  Come on, Ross, that didnt mean anything! She just had the baby, she
was all freaked out about doing it alone, she would have said yes to anybody.
Ross  Yeah thats what she said.
Joey  So?
Ross  So I dont wanna be just anybody.
Joey  Wow.
Ross  You know what, its, its better this way anyway. I mean I
dont know what I was thinking, going down that road again with us. Its just
much easier if were just friends who have a kid.
Joey  Really?
Ross  Yeah.
Joey  And youre Okay with that?
Ross  Yes. I mean, its what we always planned.  And if you have a
plan, you should stick to it.  Thats why they call them plans.  Hello?
(Pause) Im fine.
Joey  Hey, for what its worth, with Rachel I dont think youll
ever be just (Makes quote marks.) "anybody."
Ross  Hey there you go! (Smiles because Joey used it correctly)
Joey  (makes quote marks) "Thanks."
[Scene  Ross and Rachels, Emma continues to cry.]
Rachel  Oh my God! How long has she been crying?
Monica  About a week and a half.
Phoebe  Well alright, looks like you guys have got it under control so Im
just gonna go. (She gets up and Rachel looks at her, upset, and Monica just stares.) No!
Really? Misery really does love company. All right! (She sits back down.)
Monica  Rach, try holding her a different way.
Rachel  You guys, Im doing the best I can, anyone else is welcome to try.
Phoebe  Alright, Ill try, fine! Yes, Okay!
Rachel  Here you go. (Hands Emma to Phoebe)
Phoebe  Shh! Nothing works with this child! (Hands her back.)
Rachel  Oh god what am I gonna do you guys, I cant even comfort my own
baby! Im the worst mother ever!
Monica  Youre just new at this, itll get better, think about your
first day at work. I mean, that couldnt have been easy but you figured that out.
Rachel  Yeah I dont think dressing provocatively is going to help me here!
Oh my god just please take her.
Monica  Okay Ill take her, here. (Takes Emma)
Rachel  I have to go to the bathroom. (Goes to the bathroom)
Phoebe  I have to go scream into a pillow. (Goes to scream into a pillow)
Monica  (To Emma) Bouncy baby, Bouncy baby, Ooh baby baby, Ooh baby baby, Ooh
baby baby. (Emma stops crying and falls asleep)
Phoebe  (entering) Have I gone deaf?
Monica  It worked! Ooh baby baby baby, ooh baby baby baby!
Phoebe  You must be a fireball in bed.
Monica  I cant believe it!  Shes asleep!  I got her to go
to sleep!   I have actual magical powers!
Phoebe  I can hear traffic and birds!  I can hear the voices in my head
again! (Monica looks at her strangely) Im kidding. (She smiles wickedly.)
Rachel  Oh my God! You got her to stop crying!
Monica  Yes I did, Im Monica, Super Aunt
Rachel  You are the official baby crier stopper!
Monica  Yes I am!!
Rachel  Youre never leaving the apartment!
Monica  Say what?
Rachel  Thats your new job, day and night, she starts crying I need you
here.
Monica  (stands up to hand Emma back) Oh no no no no!
Phoebe  Thankfully you dont need me at all (gets up and to leave) so Okay
Super aunt see you later! Rachel lets give it six to eight months (she leaves).
Rachel  Okay so listen Im gonna go lay down.
Monica  What?
Rachel  You know the book says that whenever shes sleeping I should be
sleeping so (She gives Monica thumbs and goes to lay down)
Chandler  (entering, loudly) Hey!
Monica  Shhh! We just got her to go to sleep
Chandler  Oh so there cant be any yelling.
Monica  No.
Chandler  Were moving to Tulsa
Monica  (loudly) What!?
Chandler  Shhhh! Shhhhh! Shhhhh! Shhhhh! (Walks backwards towards the door) I
cant, I cant hear you. (He runs out)
[Scene  Ross and Rachels, Ross enters.]
Ross  Hey.
Rachel  Heeeeey, where have you been? (He shows her his thumb) What happened to
you?
Ross  Ah I had a little thing with Joey, if you think this is bad you should see
him.
Rachel  Oh no Ross! This is not good, we have to talk about this Joey thing.
Please sit. (He sits) You have got to get over this Joey thing, okay? I never really
wanted to marry Joey, okay?
Ross  Okay.
Rachel  You know what I really really want?
Ross  What, Rach?
Rachel  I wanna sleep, I wanna eat, I wanna take a shower, I mean before she
wakes up and we gotta do this all over again.
Ross  (smiles) Right.
Rachel  I mean I got news for you mister, Emma?  Not easy.
Ross  Well, thats what Im here for. (Emma starts crying again) Want
me to get that?
Rachel  No its really okay Monica!
Monica  (comes running out the kitchen to the bedroom) Got it! Got it! Got it!
Got it! Got it! Got it!
[Scene  Central Perk, Joey and Ross are sitting at one of the high tables.]
Joey  You know, ah, Ive been thinking about this and I gotta tell ya,
its not my fault. Its a natural instinct.
Chandler  (enters) Hey, what you guys talking about?
Joey  Hey OK great, what would you do if I did this? (Swings to punch Chandler,
he moves and he ends up punching Ross, knocking him off the stool. Ross then gets up and
just stares at Joey.)

[Scene  Chandler and Monica's apartment]
Rachel  Hi!
Ross  Hey! So what's the big news you had us rush all the
  way over here for?
Chandler  Okay, our news. My company has asked me to head
  up our office in Tulsa , so as of Monday I'm being officially relocated.
Ross  Oh my God!
Phoebe  What?!
Rachel  What?!
Ross  Monday?!
Joey  How long do you have to go for?
Chandler  They said it could be up to a year.
Joey  A year?!
Rachel  (To Monica) Do you have to go?
Monica  I kind of have to don't I? Because of this stupid
  thing (Points to her wedding ring.)
Chandler  There is nothing like the support of your loving
  wife, huh?
Joey  Wait a minute, you can't go to Tulsa. Maybe you forgot,
  but we've got tickets to the Jets game next week.
Chandler  I'm sorry buddy, but I don't think I'm gonna be
  able to make it.
Joey  We were gonna go see the Jets!
Ross  You can't go, I mean you're the glue that holds this
  group together!
Chandler  Really?
Ross  Not you.
Joey  I can't believe you guys are moving.
Phoebe  I call their apartment!!!
Everyone  No!!! Ah!! Ahh!!!
[Scene  Central Perk]
Joey  Here you are (Hands Rachel a cup of coffee)
Rachel  Thank you Joey. You know what? I'm not even sure
  I can have caffeine.
Ross  I went thru this with Ben and Carol. One cup of coffee
  won't affect your milk.
Rachel  Yeah. Just to be sure I'm gonna call Dr. Wiener.
Joey  (Laughs)
Rachel  Every time? (She takes up her cell phone and starts
  dialing.)
Joey  Uhuh.
Ross  Rach, you don't have to call whenever you have a little
  question, okay? Trust me, I know this.
Rachel  All right, I trust you. (Continues to dial)
Ross  Rachel, I can see you dialing! I don't understand why...
Rachel  I'm on the phone! (On the phone) Dr. Wiener? (Ross
  and Rachel walk away)
Joey  (Laughs)
Phoebe  It's so weird seeing Ross and Rachel with a baby.
  It's just so grown up.
Joey  I know, yeah. I feel like we're all growing up. Person
  named Wiener, God that kills me. (Laughs)
Phoebe  Look at you all grown up.
Joey  Actually, you know what? I am. That whole thing with
  Rachel made me realize that maybe I'm ready for a more serious relationship.
  You know? Like I'd like to meet a nice mature commitment-minded lady. And looks
  aren't as important as...Nah, she's gotta be hot.
Phoebe  You know, I might know somebody. Hey, how about you
  set me up with someone, and we double date!
Joey  I can do that, yeah. How is Friday?
Phoebe  Done. Oh good, really?
Joey  Yeah!
Phoebe  Let's see! (Opens her address book.) Oh, you know
  who's great? Sandy Poophack.
Joey  (Laughs) Poophack... (Laughs)
Phoebe  Yeah... All right, well that rules out Lana Titweiller
Joey  (Laughs)
[SCENE  Chandler and Monica's apartment]
Chandler  (Enters) Hey!
Monica  Hey!
Chandler  I've got good news!
Monica  You got out of the whole Tulsa thing?
Chandler  Okay, I have news. You don't have to move to Tulsa.
  You can stay here and keep your job.
Monica  It's great! How?
Monica  So you're gonna be gone four days a week? (Thinks
  about it.) No.
Chandler  I'm sorry, are you just used to saying that?
Monica  No. I can't be away from you for that long.
Chandler  Really?
Monica  Yeah, you're my husband. I'm not gonna live in a
  different state than you for 208 days out of the year.
Chandler  That's fast math! We could use you in Tulsa.
Monica  Honey, thanks for trying to figure out a way, but
  if you're going to Tulsa, I wanna go with you.
Chandler  Hey, you said that without gagging!
Monica  I know! (They high-five.)
[Scene  Ross and Rachel's apartment]
Rachel  (On the phone) Excuse me? Oh yeah? Well, up yours
too! (Hangs up)
Ross  (Enters from his bedroom)Who the hell was that?!
Rachel  Dr. Wiener.
Ross  Rach, you can't call people at three in the morning.
Rachel  Oh you know what, you sound just like his wife!
Ross  Was there anything you did wrong with Emma?
Rachel  Yes, of course there is! Okay? I'm not insane!
Ross  Well, what was it?
Rachel  Hiccups.
Ross  Rach, I told you, you can't call him every time any
  little thing comes up.
Rachel  Yeah well, not anymore I can't. He fired us! What
  are we gonna do? We have to find a pediatrician. Wait wait, Monica said that
  when you guys were growing up, you really liked your doctor. What was his name?
Ross  Dr. Gettleman? Yeah I know, I don't think that's a
  good idea. In fact, I think he's dead.
Rachel  Argh! Why does everything happen to me?!
Ross  Rach, I promise first thing tomorrow we'll find another
  doctor, but I gotta get up early and I'm not feeling all that well.
Rachel  What? What, do you mean you're not feeling well?
  What do you have? Is it Rubella? Because don't go near Emma, she has not had
  that shot.
Ross  You know? Come to think of it, it does feel Rubella-like!
  (Walks back into his room.)
Rachel  (Grabs the phone and stars dialing) (On phone) (In
  a high pitch voice) Wiener, Wiener (In a low pitch voice) Wiener, Wiener!!!
Ross  (Comes back into the living room) Rachel!!!
Rachel  Great! Now he's gonna know it was me!
[Scene  Joey's apartment]
Phoebe  (Enters) Hey!
Joey  Hey!
Phoebe  So how is this for our big double date tonight? (She
  is all dressed up)
Joey  (Realizes that he has forgotten all about the double
  date) Oh my God!
Phoebe  Ooh, great! Just the reaction I was hoping for.
Joey  Yeah, so you found someone for me. You didn't forget?
Phoebe  Of course not! And you're gonna love Mary Ellen.
  She's really smart and cute and funny, and I can't tell you how I know this,
  but she' not opposed to threesomes. So tell me some about my guy.
Joey  No.
Phoebe  Come on, give me something. What's his name?
Joey  Mike.
Phoebe  Mike? Okay! What's his last name?
Joey  Damnit! Is there no mystery left in romance anymore!?
Phoebe  All right, we'll se you and Mike at the restaurant
  in a couple hours.
Joey and Phoebe  (Ad-lib good-byes) (Phoebe leaves)
Joey  Why did I have to say Mike? I don't know a Mike! Why
  couldn't I have said... (Looks through his address book) There's no guy in
  there!
[Scene  Chandler and Monica's apartment]
Rachel  It's impossible to find a good doctor. I mean, how
  do you know the good ones from the ones who are gonna push their penis against
  your knee?
Monica  Excuse me?
Chandler  I know what she's talking about.
Rachel  We've got to find a new pediatrician. Ross was getting
  sick last night, and I think Emma may have caught it.
Monica  Why don't you go see Dr. Gettleman?
Rachel  Ross said he died.
Monica  He didn't die. I saw his daughter last week. Said
  he was fine. Her on the other hand, botched Botox.
Rachel  Oh, great! Well, then I'm gonna take Emma to see
  him. I wonder why Ross said that he died.
Monica  Oh, maybe he was getting him confused with his childhood
  therapist.
Chandler  He saw a therapist?
Monica  Yeah, he used to have this recurring nightmare, just
  really freaked him out.
Rachel  Why? What was it?
Monica  That I was going to eat him.
[Scene  Central Perk]
Joey  MIKE!!!
Mike  Yeah?
Joey  (Checks him out) Okay! (Walks over to his table and
  sits down with him)
[Scene  Restaurant]
Mike  I gotta tell you, I can't believe I'm doing this with
  you. Although I did just get out of a nine-year relationship, so I guess I
  should be open and taking some risks.
Joey  Everything is gonna be fine. Just follow my lead, okay?
  All you have to do is pretend to be Mike.
Mike  I am Mike.
Joey  Atta boy!
Joey  Okay, look...
Everyone  (Ad-lib hellos)
Phoebe  Joey, this is Mary Ellen Jenkins. So, Mike, how do
  you and Joey know each other anyway?
Mike  How do I and Joey know each other? Wow, if I had a
  nickel for every time somebody has asked me that.
Joey  (Laughs) From school.
Mike  Yeah, we met in college. (Off Joey's look) I mean,
  high school.
Phoebe  Wow, you guys go way back then. So what are you up
  to these days?
Mike  Well, I'm a lawyer.
Joey  Mike, 'attorney at law'!
Mike  Actually, I just gave up my practice.
Joey  What? That's the kinda thing you usually run by me.
Mike  I always wanted to play piano professionally, and I
  figured if I don't do this now, I never will.
Phoebe  Wow, that's great! I liked that better than the law
  thing, so...
Joey  Which is why I waited until now to introduce you to
  Mike.
Mary Ellen  I thought you thought he was still a lawyer.
Joey  No, no, that's not what I meant. Let's get you a cocktail.
[Scene  Chandler and Monica's apartment]
Monica  Hey!
Chandler  Hey!
Monica  What are you doing?
Chandler  Looking for restaurant jobs for you in Tulsa.
Monica  That's so sweet. Find anything?
Chandler  Slim Pickings.
Monica  Nothing, huh?
Chandler  No, 'Slim Pickings', it's a barbecue restaurant.
  They're looking for a cook. Actually 'cook' may be a bit of a stretch. They're
  looking for someone to shovel mesquite.
Monica  'Slim Pickings'...That is so cheesy.
Chandler  'So Cheesy' also has an opening.
Monica  Honey, that's okay. I actually know this woman, Nancy,
  who's a restaurant biz head-hunter. Maybe she'll know of something.
Chandler  Can I just say how much I appreciate you coming
  with me. When we get to Tulsa I'm taking you for a great dinner at 'Slim Pickings'.
  'So Cheesy'? 'Whole Hog'? It's going to be tough to keep Kosher in Tulsa.
Monica  (On phone) Hi, Nancy. Hi, it's Monica Geller. I'm
  good. Listen, I'm looking for a job in Tulsa. Well yeah, my husband has been
  relocated...Because I love him! No, I don't want a job in New York. Javo (sp?)
  is looking? Oh my God! He asked for me personally? Oh my God! Oh, wow, this
  is really flattering, but I'm moving to Tulsa. Yeah, so if you would tell Javo
  (sp?) 'I'll take it!'
[Scene  Pediatrician's office]
Rachel  Hi, my name is Rachel Green, I have an appointment
  for Emma.
Receptionist  Dr. Gettleman is finishing up with a patient,
  he should be out shortly.
Dr. Gettleman  (To a patient) I think you just have a cold,
  it's definitely not Strep.
Ross  Thanks doctor.
Dr. Gettleman  Would you like a lollypop?
Ross  You even have to ask?! (He grabs a lollypop out of
  a jar) (Sees Rachel) (To Rachel) He is alive!
[Scene  Restaurant]
Phoebe  You know, it's so surprising that you and Joey have
  known each other for so long and I've never heard about you.
Joey  Yeah, that's because we had a bit of a falling out.
  Mike hit my mom with a car.
Mike  No, I didn't.
Joey  That's okay Mike, I have forgiven you. And now we're
  friends again everything's great!
Joey  Please, we're trying to have a conversation. (Pushes
  the wine glass closer to Mary Ellen.)
Mary Ellen  Wow, you're a lot nicer on 'Days of Our Lives'.
Mike  'Days of Our Lives'! That's why you look so familiar!
Phoebe  What?!
Mike  What?!
Joey  What?!
Phoebe  Do you not know each other?
Joey  (Laughs) Of course we do! Mike is playing a game that
  we used to play in high school. Yeah, where we pretend we don't know each other.
  We played all kinds of games. (To Mike) Hey, remember the one where I punch
  you in the face for not being cool?!
Phoebe  Mike, let me ask you something. How many sisters
  does Joey have?
Mike  (Joey holds up six fingers) Six!
Joey  What are you doing? I said seven! (Holds up six fingers.)
  (Realizes his mistake) Argh!!!
Phoebe  Joey, why did you set me up with a stranger?
Joey  Because I forgot about our date, I'm so sorry.
Mike  I'm sorry too. And just to be clear, I didn't hit his
  mother with a car.
Phoebe  (To Joey) You are unbelievable! I spent so much time
  finding the perfect girl for you, you know. Mary Ellen is really smart and
  cute and loose.
Mary Ellen  Hey!
Phoebe  Who are you kidding? (To Joey) You just find some
  guy off the street for me? Oh God! This is humiliating!
Joey  Look Phoebe I'm so sorry! Hey, look, if you don't like
  this guy I can find you a better one. (Looks around) Mike!! Mike!!
Phoebe  I'm out of here (She leaves)
Mike  It was nice meeting you!
Joey  (To Mary Ellen) You're leaving too?
Mary Ellen  I'll stay if you can tell me my name.
Joey  Good night!
[Scene  Chandler and Monica's apartment]
Chandler  Honey, we're leaving tomorrow you've still got
  a lot of packing to do.
Monica  You're right. (Pause) Maybe I shouldn't go.
Chandler  What?
Monica  So Nancy told me about this job at this great restaurant,
  Javo (sp?). It's just a little outside of Tulsa.
Chandler  How far outside?
Monica  Manhattan.
Chandler  And you're thinking of taking it? (Pause) So before
  you said being me with me was more important than any job, but I guess now
  it's old job, (Raises his hand) me, (Raises his hand) new job.
Monica  I'm gonna miss this hand! Okay I know it's a lot
  to ask, but oh my God Chandler, this is a once in a lifetime opportunity.
Chandler  What happened to 'you can't live without me four
  days a week'?
Monica  Well, if you really think about it, I mean four days
  is not that long. I mean, I see you Monday before you go to work, and I see
  you Thursday when you get back, and I always work late on Tuesdays, so really
  if you think about it, it's really just one day. And well, if we can't make
  it one day, we've got real problems my friend.
Chandler  I think you should take the job.
Monica  Really?
Chandler  Yeah. I know it must be important to you when you
  start chattering like a monkey.
Monica  That's the nicest anyone has ever said to me!
Ross  Hey!
Monica  How was the pediatrician?
Rachel  Oh, I really liked him. (Looks at Ross) Yeah, it
  was really, really, really good.
Ross  You promised you wouldn't say anything.
Rachel  I know. (Pause) Ross still sees his pediatrician!!!
  (To Ross) I don't care!
Monica  Are you serious? You still see Dr. Gettleman?
Ross  He's a brilliant diagnostician!
Chandler  Diagnostician or boo-boo fixer?
Rachel  Ross, seriously! You've gotta go to an appropriate
  doctor.
Ross  Why? Why? I know it's a little weird, but hey, he's
  a great doctor, okay? He knows my medical history, and every time I go in there,
  he makes a big deal. 'Ah look, it's my favorite patient!'
Chandler  Does he say that before he sticks his thermometer
  in your touchy?
Ross  Hey, I seem to remember someone bringing his security
  blanket to college!
Chandler  That was not a security blanket! That was a wall-hanging!
Ross  It didn't spend much time on the wall!!!
[Scene  Central Perk]
Mike  Excuse me, hi. I was hoping I would run into you. Can
  we talk?
Phoebe  Sure.
Mike  I'm sorry, really, I'm so embarrassed. Really, I'm
  a pretty nice guy. Just ask my parole officer...Apparently I'm not a funny
  guy.
Phoebe  Why did you go along with that?
Mike  Because I was told I'd get a free dinner, which I didn't.
  And that I'd meet a pretty girl. Which I did.
Phoebe  That's true. (Pause) Well, is anything you told me
  about yourself true?
Mike  My name in Mike, and I do play piano.
Phoebe  Prove it.
Mike  There isn't a piano here.
Phoebe  That wouldn't stand in the way of a true pianist.
Mike  (Plays 'air piano')
Phoebe  You are really good! I play a little guitar myself.
Mike  Really?
Phoebe  Uhuh.
Mike  That's great. What kind of music do you play?
Phoebe  Well, like acoustic folksy stuff. You know? But right
  now I'm working on a couple 'Iron Maiden' covers.
Mike  Do you think that maybe, sometime, I could...
Phoebe  It's okay. Go ahead, ask me out.
Mike  Okay. Do you think maybe sometime I could take you
  out?
Joey  (Walks In)
Phoebe  (To Mike) Oh, you just caught me off guard! Yeah,
  that would be nice.
Joey  Look at this. My two best friends!
[Scene  Pediatrician's office]
Ross  Excuse me, I don't mean to be a jerk, but the baby
  with the rash came in after me.
Receptionist  The doctor will be right with you sir.
Girl  (Reading a book) Mommy, I can't find Waldo.
Ross  With the circus? He's behind the elephant.
Woman  Wow, so your child is a big fan of the Waldo books
  too?
Ross  Yeah, that's how I know. I'm Ross by the way.
Sally  Hi, I'm Sally. So, no ring. Can I assume you are also
  a single parent?
Ross  I am a single parent.
Sally  It's hard isn't it? There's almost no time for a social
  life. I mean, where are you gonna meet someone?
Ross  Well, let's say, I don't know, you met someone in the
  pediatrician's office.
Nurse  (To Ross) Rossy, we're ready for you.
Ross  Hmm, yeah. (To a random boy in the waiting room) Come
  on Ross jr. It's time to go in.
Boy  Mommy (He walks over to Sally.)
Girl  Mommy, what's wrong with that man?
Ross  Hey, I helped you find Waldo!
[Scene  Chandler and Monica's apartment]
Ross  (Enters) Oh good, you haven't left yet.
Monica  Where have you been?
Ross  I got held up at Dr. Gettleman's office. There was
  some guy that freaked everybody out.
Chandler  Well, you got here just in time. I really have
  to go buddy. (They hug)
Ross  Oh man.
Monica  Promise to call me when you land.
Chandler  Of course I will call you. I love you.

Rachel  Okay, wow, wow, wow. Watch the tongue people, we've
  got a baby over here.
Phoebe  Bye Chandler.
Chandler  Awww. (They hug) Bye!
Rachel  Bye honey. (They hug)
Chandler  (Tries to hug Joey but J. moves away) What's the
  matter Joe?
Joey  I'm mad at you for leaving! You're nothing but a big
  leaver. Big leaver with a stupid suitcase.
Chandler  Any chance you are trying to pick a fight to make
  all this easier?
Joey  Dude, you see right thru me!! (They hug) (Joey heads
  for the door and pushes Chandler's suitcase on the way out.)
Chandler  Well, bye Mon, bye Ross, Rachel, bye Emma!
Phoebe  Okay, bye-bye! (Pushes Chandler out the door.) Good
  trip! (Slams the door)
Chandler  I know.
Monica  I love you so much.
Chandler  I know that too. (They kiss)
[Scene  Airport]
Chandler  (On cell phone) Don't worry, I'll be back before
  you know it. Yes it will be the same. Because I know, that's how. I promise.
CUT TO  Monica and Chandler's apartment.
Joey  (On the phone with Chandler) Double promise? Call me
  when you land.
Monica  Can I talk now?
Joey  Okay, bye. (He hangs up the phone.)
Monica  Joey?
Joey  He had to board.

Ross  you know I really admire your whole dating attitude,
  it's so healthy I'm always like is this moving to fast? Is this moving to slow?
  Where's this going?
Phoebe  yea you know you are a bit of a drama queen.
Ross  but you, your so much better off you just go from
  guy to guy having fun and never worrying that it terns into anything serious.
Phoebe  I wouldn't say never, you know there's that guy
  (pause) well what about (pause) ok well there's gotta be someone.

Joey  look I don't usually ask out women that I meet in
  coffeehouses

Hayley  I would love to go out with you.
Joey  really, great, did I actually ask you?
Hayley  no that's just where you were going I just figured that I'd help
  you out, you don't seem like the kind of guy that does this very a lot.
Gunther  HA!
Joey  (turns round again) seriously Gunther you should see
  someone about that cold, if it gets much worse you could DIE! (Gunther looks
  scared)
[Scene  Ross is at Phoebe's.]
Ross  so how'd the date go?

Ross  So he hasn't called?
Phoebe  would you call this girl? (Puts on a crying act)
  thanks-fo-r-a-love-ly-even-ing
Ross  now I feel terrible this is all my fault.
Phoebe  well you not what you should feel terrible about,
  this could have been my serious guy he was sweet and smart and funny. Do you
  know how hard it is to meet a guy like that?
Ross  We are a rare breed.
[Scene  Joey is back at Hayleys apartment.]
Hayley  what a great dinner.
Joey  yeah and hey thanks again for letting me having that
  last piece of cake at the restaurant.
Hayley  (laughs) your welcome again, I'm gonna make some coffee can I get
  you anything?
Joey  do you have any cake?
Joey  (bends down to see and the cactus pricks him in the
  ass) AWCH! That's why.

Ross  Damn super cuts!
Mike  what's up is Phoebe ok?
Ross  oh no yeah, no Phoebe is great, but umm I'm an idiot
  look right before you guys went out I accidentally got her all upset.
Mike  that's why she was weird.
Ross  yes, yeah I said something stupid about her never
  having had a serious relationship, but you should know she is so much fun,
  a wonderful person please don't blow her off.
Mike  I'm not blowing her off, I actually just got off the
  phone with her, were going out tomorrow night, I mean I hope that's ok with
  you stranger from the coffee house.
Ross  well then I didn't need to bother you or the four
  other Mike Hanagens I bothered.
Mike  hey wait wait wait wait wait! Is that true what you
  said Phoebe's never had a serious relationship?
Ross  of course she has. if she'd never had a serious relationship
  I'd go round broadcasting it like some unstoppable moron.
Mike  but you did say it
Ross  yes, yes I did. and I will also say what I'm about
  to say Vis-à-vis the following Phoebe has never had a serious relationship
  since her. super-serious relationship with. Vicrum.
Mike  Vicrum?
Ross  WHAT THAT'S A REAL NAME!
[Scene  Chandler arrives home from work.]
Chandler  (enters singing) Oklahoma where the wind comes
  sweeping down the plane, STOP IT! Why couldn't they have sent me to Texas?
  7 o clock maybe I'll hit the gym (sits down) who am I kidding pay-per-view
  porn.
Chandler  everything's great, just watching some regular
  television there, what a pleasant surprise. (She hugs him, and she knows what
  he was doing so she looks at the TV and sees sharks swimming around thinking
  Chandler was giving himself a treat to sharks.)
Chandler  Ok honey. that was close.
Rachel  Hello
Rachel  Oh that couldn't have been pretty. but you know
  guys do that.
Rachel  Nooooooooo!
[Scene  Rachel is at Monica's, talking about Chandler & him
  watching "Shark Porn".]
Rachel  well watching sharks? Are you sure that's what he
  was doing?
Rachel  man sharks. I always knew there was something weird
  about that dude. But you promised to love him no matter what.
Rachel  Ah! You know what honey guys are just different,
  they like things that we can't understand, you know I once dated this guy who
  wanted to pretend he was an archeologist and I was a naughty cave woman that
  he unfroze from a block of ice.
Rachel  yeah I didn't disguise that very well did i.
Joey  (enters) Hey
Rachel  (sits down) Hi
Joey  listen to this... I went out with this girl last night
  and half way through our date I realized I already slept with her.
Rachel  so basically you've slept with all the woman in
  New York and now you're just going around again.
Joey  well that's not even the weird part. I don't think
  she remembered sleeping with me.
Joey  yeah but she should remember sleeping with me I am
  very memorable, you guys know.
Rachel  what, how do we know, we never slept with you.
Joey  and who's fault is that.
Joey  HEY! I never have an off night ok although sometimes
  when I'm a little bloated I don't feel very sexy BUT EVEN THEN I'M BETTER THEN
  MOST!
Rachel  yeah your both so slutty you don't even remember
  who you've slept with, you're made for each other.
Joey  Interesting. all right I'll go out with her again
  and try to get past it (reaches for the chips) OH SALT BLOATY!
Joey  What?
Joey  No. (Pause) wait a minute what was the little mermaid?
[Scene  Phoebe's at her apartment waiting for Mike Ross comes over.]
Phoebe  It's open.

Ross  YAY! (He continues the happiness with her by dancing
  around) quick thing, I went to talk to Mike.
Phoebe  What? Wha-wha-wha-did you do ROSS!
Ross  oh boy you got mad at that part. I went over there
  to tell him how great you are but you know me BLAH, BLAH, BLAH, and I ended
  up telling him that.
Phoebe  WHAT!
Ross  umm. that you had a six year long relationship with
  a guy named Vicrum.
Phoebe  WHAT! WHY?
Ross  well he seemed to bum hard that you'd never been in
  a serious relationship.
Phoebe  (Walks towards Ross) If you hadn't just had a baby
  with my best friend I swear to Lucifer a raber dog would be feasting on your
  danglers RIGHT NOW!
Ross  well Phoebe, I think you'll feel better when you know
  a little bit about Vicrum, His a Kite designer (He makes a wow face) and he
  used to date Oprah. (He makes another wow face)
Phoebe  I'm not going along with some lie you made Ross,
  No I'm just gonna be honest with him.
Ross  Good yeah just be honest with him.
Phoebe  yeah I've nothing to be ashamed of ok so I haven't
  been in a relationship that lasted longer then a month. Ok I haven't had a
  real boyfriend you know if he can't handle that he can leave. which he will
  and that's ok. so I'll just be alone forever you know alright I'll be. it'll
  be fine. it'll be fine. I'll go walking tours with widows and lesbians. Oh
  (takes a deep breath and sits down, knock on the door)
Ross  I'll get it
Phoebe  ok
Mike  (Ross opens the door) You know I'm trying to think
  of the last time I opened a door and you weren't there, Phoebe are you ok?
  (She has her hands over her mouth)
Phoebe  Uh huh yeah (stands up) there's just something umm,
  there's something you should know (Pause) Vicrum just called.
[Scene  Joey is back at Hayley's place after there date.]
Hayley  so it was kind of a shock after 25 years of marriage my parents,
  a perfect couple getting divorced, I kinda took it the hardest cause I was
  the youngest.
Joey  Uh huh, sure, yeah. How can you not remember me?
Hayley  What?
Joey  How could you not remember that we slept together?
Hayley  What! When?
Joey  I dunno!
Hayley  I really, really think I would remember sleeping with you
Joey  come on, come on, search your brain all right. it
  was (thinks) a certain amount of time ago, I was here you were here, we had
  sex (starts pointing out the places) here, here, here NOT there. Anything?
Hayley  no it's not ringing any bells.
Joey  my god woman! How many people do you have to had been
  with not to remember any of this?
Hayley's roommate  Hey Hayley you've really gotta fix that doorknob. Joey!
Joey  Ooooooooooh, I slept with you! And you obviously remember
  me Hey! I still got it. (Turns back to Hayley) so were good. (She just glares
  at him) I'll let myself out.
[Scene  Phoebe is sitting with Mike, explaining about Vicrum.]
Phoebe  .and I said Vicrum you can't just call every time
  you get lonely you know, you, you gave up that right when you slept with Rachel.
Mike  But Rachel I thought she just had a baby with Ross
Phoebe  yeah well (pause) yeah you know Emma's birth certificate
  might say Geller but her eyes say Mookurgee.
Mike  that is so wrong and on top of that his a glue sniffer.
Phoebe  I know but he call's and my heart goes to him. You
  know that bastard is one smooth talking free lance kite designer.
Mike  I just think there's somebody better out there for
  you, (pause) I mean I'm not saying me but. maybe me.
Phoebe  Oh.
Mike  and you don't have to worry about glue sniffing with
  me. although I do smell the occasional magic marker, yeah ah anyway I just
  think I can make you happy.
Phoebe  ok I can't do this.
Mike  what's wrong?
Phoebe  well there is no Vicrum, Ross made him up because
  I never really have been in a long-term relationship, I've never lived with
  a guy, and I've never even celebrated an anniversary so. (Pause) if that's
  too weird for you and you wanna leave I totally understand. In fact I'll close
  my eye's make it less awkward (She sits with her eyes closed and Mike kisses
  her, Phoebe opens her eyes and like a little child says.) You kissed me.
Mike  uh huh
Phoebe  so you don't think I'm a total freak
Mike  No. well look can I think your weird and also cool
  for telling me the truth and also wanna kiss you.
Phoebe  I guess so, can I. can I think it's cool that you
  kiss me and also wanna kiss you again (they get closer to kiss and Phoebe pulls
  back) and umm, be a little concerned about the magic markers.
Mike  Definitely
Ross  (They kiss and the phone rings and machine picks it
  up, its Ross putting on an accent pretending to be Vicrum) This is Vicrum.
[Scene  Chandler arrives home and Monica's got a video
  of Sharks ready for Chandler.]
Chandler  Hi honey I'm home!
Chandler  oh it was great.
Chandler  well, well, well it must be five in Tulsa because
  it's six o clock IN NY.C!
Chandler  (Chandler looking confused) Honey why am I watching
  a bunch of sharks swimming around.
Chandler  no I'm not quite sure you got the right movie
  that's all.
Chandler  does what always have to be sharks.
Chandler  What's going on?
Chandler  let ME be a part of this!
Chandler  no they don't
Chandler  OH MY GOD! When you came in I switched the channel,
  I was just watching regular porn
Chandler  yeah just some good old fashion girl on girl American
  action.
Chandler  You are an amazing wife. (Monica shrugs) No really
  you're amazing you were actually gonna do this for me, I mean where do you
  find the strength and understanding over something like that.
[Scene  Phoebe is in central-perk with Joey telling him what Ross said t
  her at the beginning.]
Joey  (looks at a girl walk in) see ordinarily I would talk
  to her, but my confidence is shaken did I sleep with her? Did I not sleep with
  her?
Phoebe  you know maybe this is a wake up call, about your
    whole dating attitude. Your in your thirty's and you've never had a serious
    relationship and you have never been in a long term relationship, here you
    go from woman to woman, meaningless experience to meaningless experience
    never even worrying that it doesn't tern into anything serious.
Joey  your right! I love my life! (He gets up to go and
  speak to the girl and he turns back and sits down) I actually did sleep with
  her.

[Scene  Central Perk. All except Chandler, plus Emma.]
Phoebe  Oh hey you guys, I couldn’t get a reservation for the night of 
my birthday, so we have to do dinner Thursday night instead.
Joey  Thursday? But that’s Halloween.
Phoebe  So?
Joey  [It’s just] So spooky, that’s all.
Ross  So, so, is Mike coming to dinner?
Phoebe  No! It’s my first birthday with a boyfriend, and he has to 
work. Uch, I get mad at him, but I think it’s a little to soon to show my true 
colors.
Phoebe  Oh, Rachel!
Ross  Actually, um, I was thinking maybe both of us could go.
Phoebe  Oh, yay!
Ross  Thanks, I put a lot of extra thoughts on your gift.
Phoebe  Alright, okay, so we can all go now. That is fun. Hey, you 
know what? We all haven’t been together the six of us in such a long time.
Monica  What are you talking about? We’re all together right now.
Rachel  Um, Mon, Chandler’s not here.
Monica  Oh, dear god!
[Scene  Tulsa, a conference room. Chandler is chairing a group of 
eight people.]
Chandler  Good morning everyone, it’s nice to see our team together 
for the first time. Now, before we get started, are there any questions? 
(colleague raises hand) Yes, Ken is it?
Ken  That’s right. Is it true, that the reason you are here in Tulsa 
is that you fell asleep in a meeting and took the job without realizing what you 
were saying yes to?
Claudia  I’m sorry. Does the smoke bother you?
Claudia  Yes, in Oklahoma it’s legal to smoke in offices with fifteen 
people or less. (passing the pack) Would you like one?
Chandler  Alright, lo…look. I don’t smoke anymore. But if the rest of 
you want to light up, go ahead, it’s fine. (everyone lights up) So you all smoke 
then? That’s almost rude, that I’m not.
Ken  That’s not true. If you don’t wanna smoke …
Chandler  (loud) Ken, please! No, I can’t, I can’t smoke. If I smoke, 
my wife would kill me.
Ken  I’m sorry, but isn’t your wife back in New York?
Chandler  I always liked you, Ken. (takes a cigarette)
[Scene  The Bings’. Monica in bathrobe, merely covered. Someone’s
  
knocking at the door.]
Phoebe  (from outside) Trick or treat! (It’s obviously Halloween eve, 
the night of her birthday dinner.)
Monica  (opening the door) Hey!
Phoebe  Ooh, and treat it is. (Monica’s breasts.)
Monica  Hmhmm. (ties up)
Phoebe  Wow, so glad I changed. Almost wore my ??? outfit that can’t 
contain my breasts.
Monica  This is not, what I’m wearing. I’m ovulating and Chandler’s 
gonna be home any minute, so I thought we would try before dinner.
Phoebe  Ohh. Oh wait! (Jis) you guys won’t be late for my dinner, will 
you?
Monica  Believe me, Chandler and I have not seen each other in over a 
week. We’ll probably be the first ones there.
Phoebe  ’kay, see you there. Happy humping! (outside meeting 
Chandler.) Hey…hey! Oh, wow, somebody smoked out here? Oh my god, don’t people 
know, you’re not allowed to smoke in public spaces?
Chandler  Actually, in Oklahoma smoking is legal in all commune areas 
and offices with fewer than fifteen people.
Phoebe  You smoked!
Chandler  No! I just happened t’do a lot trivias about smoking in 
different states. For example, in Hawaii cigarettes are called 
Leyhallalookoos.
Phoebe  (smells at him) Chandler, you stink of cigarettes.
Chandler  Uch, do you think, Monica is gonna be able smell it?
Phoebe  Are you kidding? The woman has the nose of a bloodhound … and 
the breasts of a Greek goddess.
Chandler  Pheebs?
Phoebe  (embarrassed) I’m gonna go. (leaves to stairs)
Chandler  (getting in) Okay, something to cover the smell … Oven 
cleaner! (sprays himself, reads label) Unscented!
Monica  (naughty in doorway) Welcome home. I’ve missed you. join me in 
the bedroom?
Chandler  No thanks, I’m good.
Monica  (comes over) O-kay, so you wanna play it that way, do you?
Chandler  (shrinks back) Right. You know what? Actually I just get off 
the plane, so I’m feeling kinda gross. Maybe I should just take a shower.
Monica  You don’t need a shower.
Chandler  (still backs away) Alright, the truth is, I soiled myself 
during some turbulences.
Monica  What do I smell? (sniffs him) I smell smoke. Huh—did you 
smoke?
Chandler  Yes, but I just had one. Two. Two tiny cigarettes. Okay, 
five. A pack. Two pack…a…a carton. Three big fat cartons in two days. (How many 
cigarettes are there in one pack and how many packs in one carton in the US?) 
But it’s over, I made a decision, I’m not gonna smoke anymore.
Monica  (gets a pack out of his jacket)
Chandler  But, those are for you.
[Scene  Ross and Rachel’s. Ross phones, Rachel
    and Emma are
there.]
Ross  Alright, we’ll just, uh, see when you get here. Bye. (hangs up) 
Huh, that was my mom, she’s stuck in terrible traffic.
Rachel  Okay, well that’s now the third sign that I should not leave 
Emma.
Ross  Oh, what were the other two?
Ross  I know, it’s the first time, we’re leaving the baby and … hey, I 
know how hard it is for you, but … but Emma is gonna be fine. My mom is gonna be 
with her. She’s great with kids.
Rachel  She is?
Ross  Ya.
Rachel  What about (?) Monica.
Ross  Hey, you only heard Monica’s side of that. That little fatso was 
a terror.
Rachel  Ish. I just don’t think I can bear it.
Ross  Rachel, I know that you can. And you should.
Rachel  Uch.
Ross  Really, it would be good for you and in fact, why don’t you, why 
don’t you go ahead to the restaurant and I will wait for my mom and then I’ll 
meet you there.
Rachel  Oh-A.
Ross  No, no, really. You should go. Just go! Go! Go out! Really, the 
world is your oyster. Kick up the heels. Paint the town red. (Slang right?)
Rachel  You need to learn some new slang.
Ross  I’m serious. C’mon, you should go. Here. (shoves her outside, 
while she tries to stay) No, uh-uh, just go.
Rachel  What … Oh! (points inside)
Ross  No! No, you know what? (closes the door) You [can’t get in 
there] (?), the baby’s fine, now squam (?). Yeah, [I told you a|Tell your] story 
walking. (?)
Rachel  I was just going to say that I left my keys.
Ross  Oh, (door is locked) holy molly are we in a pickle now.
[Scene  The restaurant. Phoebe and Joey are sitting alone at a table
  
for six.]
Phoebe  Where is everyone? They’re forty minutes late.
Joey  I know, u-uch.
Phoebe  I’m starving. I know we were coming here tonight, I ate 
nothing all day.
Joey  What about me, he? Only had one lunch today.
Waiter  (with British accent) Soo, are we expecting the rest of our 
party shortly?
Phoebe  Yes, they are expected presently. Yeah, yeah um, their arrival 
is in the offing.
Waiter  Right. We do have a table for two available, perhaps you would 
be more comfortable.
Joey  No, they’re comin’, we’re waitin’ right here.
Phoebe  Joseph! (to waiter) Thou needn’t worry, they shan’t be 
long.
Waiter  It’s just that we do have some large parties waiting.
Phoebe  One really does have a stick up one’s ass. Doesn’t one?
[Scene  The Bings’.]
Monica  How can you smoke in this day of age? Do you not seen that ad 
with a little kid walks to grandpa, it’s chilling.
Chandler  I messed up, it was a meeting, everybody was smoking.
Monica  So what? Don’t you have any will power?
Chandler  Will power? I’ve watch home movies of you eating ding-dongs 
(?) without taking the tin foil off.
Monica  You said that was sexy!
Monica  That’s right, because I forbid you to smoke again.
Chandler  You forbid me?
Monica  Mhmm.
Chandler  You know, I flew a long way t see my loving wife? Is she 
here by the way?
Monica  Don’t joke (?) with me, okay? I’m very, very upset right 
now.
Chandler  Oh, would you say this was the most upset you could be?
Monica  Yes.
Chandler  Then, I might as well … (grabs the cigarettes) do this 
(lights one, exhales). Not really sure what to do now.
Chandler  Fine. What!?
Monica  Sex! This is the last day I’m ovulating, and when we don’t do 
it now, we’ll have to wait till next month. (walks towards bedroom)
Chandler  You serious? (follows)
Monica  Oh yeah!
Chandler  Right, fine, I’ll do it, but no talking.
Monica  Huh, and no cuddling.
Chandler  And no kissing your neck.
Monica  Oh good, I hate it when you do that
Chandler  And lots of kissing your neck.
[Scene  Outside Ross and Rachel’s.]
Ross  Okay, well the ??? is not home.
Rachel  No. Uch.
Ross  Oh-oh, wait, my mother is gonna be here any minute. And she has 
the keys.
Rachel  Alright, I can’t, I can’t wait that long. You have to do 
something—knock that door down!
Ross  I would, but I bruise like a peach. Besides, y…you know, 
everything is gonna be fine. The baby’s sleeping.
Rachel  What if she jumped out the bassinet?
Ross  Can’t hold her own head up, but yeah jumped.
Rachel  Oh my god, I left the water running.
Ross  Rach you did not leave the water running. Please, just pull 
yourself together, okay?
Rachel  Ah, did I leave the stove on?
Ross  You never cooked since 1996. (Actually Rachel cooked in “609 - 
TOW Ross Got High”, first aired 1999-11-25.)
Rachel  Is the window open? Because if there’s a window open, a bird 
could fly in there.
Ross  Oh my god, you know what, yeah, I think you’re right. I think … 
listen, listen!
Rachel  Ubb.
Ross  A pigeon, a pigeon. (previously scared Rachel turns away) No, no 
wait, no-no, an eagle flew in. Landed on the stove and caught fire. The baby, 
seeing this, jumps across the apartment to the mighty bird’s aid. The eagle, 
however, misconstrues as an act of aggression and grabs the baby on its talon. 
Meanwhile the faucet fills the apartment with water. Baby and bird still up lays 
(?) are locked in a death grip, swirling around the whirl pool, that fills the 
apartment.
Rachel  Boy, are you gonna be sorry if that’s true.
[Scene  The restaurant with still just Phoebe and Joey.]
Waiter  Hello.
Phoebe & Joey  Hey.
Waiter  It’s been an hour. ??? be willing to reconsider switching to a 
smaller table.
Joey  Maybe we should just eat now.
Waiter  You can’t order until your entire party has arrived. 
Restaurant policy.
Waiter  Estrangement (?).
Joey  But it happens? (waiter leaves) I’m gotta go to the 
bathroom.
Phoebe  No, you can’t go. No-no-no, I can’t hold this table on my own. 
If they ask me to move, I cave.
Joey  If you ask me to stay, I’ll pee. (leaves)
Maitre D’  Good evening, Miss. (Phoebe turns her head away) Miss? 
(from the opposite side) Miss? (she turns again) Miss!
Phoebe  Okay, fine, I’ll move. Alright, you don’t have to manhandle 
me. (gets up) Where? (he points at a smaller table) Okay. Thank you. Wach.
Joey  (returns to their old table where elderly people are sitting 
now, sits) Finally you guys made it. (looks up, turns left to Phoebe’s chair) 
Pheebs, who the hell—uhuhh!
[Scene  The Bings’ bedroom, Chandler is undressing,
    Monica in bed
already.]
Monica  Spend more time with the tie. That’ll make a baby.
Chandler  Look, I can’t do this. I can’t make luv to you while we’re 
fighting this way.
Monica  Oh sure, now you’re Mister Sensitivity. But when you wanted to 
have sex right after my uncle’s funeral
Chandler  That was a celebration of life. Alright, look, I’m not gonna 
do this. Alright, is this really the way you want a baby to be conceived?
Monica  No, you’re right. Mnya, we shouldn’t do it like this. Huch. 
For what it’s worth, I’m, I’m sorry. I shouldn’t have come down on you so hard 
about the smoking. So you had a few cigarettes, not the end of the world.
Chandler  Mean it?
Monica  Yah.
Chandler  You are incredible. Unless, I…I’m not gonna smoke again. And 
if I do, I promise, I will hide it so much better from you. (they kiss)
Monica  D’you want to?
Chandler  Yeah, let’s celebrate life!
Monica  ’kay.
[Scene  Ms. Geller, Rachel and Ross storm into the apartment.]
Rachel  Och, god. (seeing Emma) Oh, thank god, you’re okay. I’m so 
sorry we left you. Mom never gonna leave you again. Never ever ever again. 
Uch.
Ross  Great. So let’s get going?
Rachel  Oh no. I mean it. After what just happened, I’m never leaving 
her again.
Ross  Somehow over time it got easier to be apart from you.
[Scene  Bings in bed, finished.]
Chandler  Uhh. You are welcome.
Monica  You know what? Let’s not talk.
Chandler  What?
Monica  Uch. I am still so mad at you for smoking.
Chandler  But you said you forgave me. It was just a couple of 
cigarettes—no big deal.
Monica  Oh, blablablabaybaybay.
Chandler  Leave it.
Monica  I was just saying that because I was ovulating and you said 
you wouldn’t have sex with me while we’re fighting.
Chandler  You tricked me to get me into bed?
Monica  That’s right, I got mine.
Chandler  I feel so used.
[Scene  Restaurant, still just the not-couple.]
Phoebe  Well, I guess they’re not coming. You wanna just order?
Waiter  Er—does not.
Phoebe  Tomato tart and which of the pastas would you recommend?
Waiter  Oh, they’re both exclus…
Phoebe  Both it is, thank you.
Ross & Rachel  (entering) Hey, hi, hi!
Waiter  I’ll just wait to put your order in.
Phoebe  You guys are over an hour late. What happened to you two?
Ross  I’m so sorry …
Rachel  We got locked out of the apartment, we …
Joey  That’s a great story—can I eat it?
Ross  And then Rachel wasn’t sure she could leave the baby.
Rachel  N-it wasn’t easy, but it’s your birthday and I did what I got 
to do.
Phoebe  And that’s Judy over there at the bar with Emma?
Rachel  Oh honey, this is for the best, thus I’m not distracted, 
worrying about Emma, how she’s doing at home and I’m being completely here with 
you and, oh, she spit up!
Ross  What?
Rachel  She spit up. Judy! She spi…Judy! Look alive, Judy! (they sit 
down) Thank you.
Ross  Thanks. Oh.
Rachel  Oh, ooh, everything looks delicious. What should I ha-ave? 
What should I have?
Joey  (mumbling) Never hit a woman. Never hit a woman.
Ross  Y’know this ??? is incredible.
Joey  Ross bruises like a peach. He bruises like a peach.
Ross  Okay, I’ll have the fixed salad and the duck.
Rachel  Yah, I’ll have the soup and the salmon.
Joey  And remember whatever comes up first. Okay? And hurry, because 
…
Monica  (entering with husband) Happy birthday!
Joey  Son of a bitch!
Phoebe  Wher-where have you been?
Monica  Well, we had a little fight.
Chandler  I would never lie to get someone into bed.
Monica  You used to tell girls you were a Kennedy. (being sat down) 
Ooh, uh, thanks. Wow, little tight, isn’t it? How d’you get a bigger table? 
You-you had a big table, but they made you move. Huh-huh, shut up Monica. Whoo, 
I suppose that Chandler will have the smoked duck.
Chandler  I suppose that Monica will have the … manipulative 
shrew.
Waiter  I’ll give you another minute.
Joey  Why are you going? He said, she wanted the shrew! (runs after 
the waiter)
Ross  Rach, c’mon, Emma is fine. You’re turning into an obsessive 
mother. Okay, you need to stop.
Rachel  Y’guys ever heard the story about when Rosses mom went to the 
beauty salon?
Chandler  You mean the lully story?
Ross  (childish) Huh-huh, they already know it.
Phoebe  You guys, we’ve been waiting for you for a long time, maybe 
you should order.
Joey  (returned) No, no, it’s okay, I already told the waiter what 
they want.
Monica  Why would you do that?
Joey  Chandler, control your woman!
Rachel  (lifts for a toast) Okay, as everybody has ordered, I would 
like to start the celebration and make a toast … to Phoebe. She dropped her 
sock.
Phoebe  Aw … what?
Rachel  N-no, Emma dropped her sock.
Monica  Mom’s here? I wanted to have lunch with her today, she told me 
she was out of town.
Rachel  Ross, she still has not noticed that the baby’s sock is on the 
ground.
Phoebe  ’s a good toast.
Rachel  (to Ross) Could you please get her attention?
Ross  W-oa … Mommy! (gestures to his not understanding mother)
Phoebe  (getting up) Oh, for god’s sake, Judy, pick up the sock! Pick 
up the sock! Pick up the sock! (everybody scared) I’m sorry, was that rude? 
Di-did my, my li-little outburst blunt (?) the hideousness (?) that is this 
evening? Look, I know, you all have a lot going on, but all I wanted to do was 
have dinner with my friends on my birthday. And you are all so late and you 
didn’t even have the courtesy to call. (her cellular rings) Well, it’s too late 
now.
Ross  Well, ??? think that’s us?
Phoebe  well, this is, this is, this is not over! (on phone) 
Hello?
Joey  (to Chandler and Monica) Well, what is going on with you 
two?
Monica  Uch, you see, I’m ovulating.
Chandler  Oh yeah, that’s what she says. But maybe you’re not 
ovulating at all, maybe it’s just a clever ruse to get me into bed.
Monica  Yes smokie, that is what it was. I just can’t get enough.
Joey  So? Did have sex, right?
Chandler  What’s the matter with me? Why I’m such a girl?
Phoebe  (returns) Okay, that was Mike.
Rachel  Phoebe, hi, we’re so sorry. You’re totally right. We are here 
one hundred per cent and we love you and we are ready to start your birthday 
celebration.
Phoebe  Mhuh, guys, that means the world to me. Huh, nkay, I’m gonna 
take off.
Rachel  What?
Phoebe  Oh, I love you guys too, but Mike got off work early. Wait. 
Wait, I’m not t—not that kind of girl that just ditches her friends to be with 
her boyfriend. You know what? I am. Bye guys! (waves to the bar) Judy! Bye.
Rachel  Oh thank god, if Phoebe’s going, can we please take Emma 
home?
Ross  You know, I think that’s a good idea—our babysitter just pounded 
in another Chardonnet. (both get up) Bye, y’guys.
Monica  Bye.
Joey  See ya. Well, this is just us.
Monica & Chandler  Mhum.
Monica  So, I’m, I’m probably still ovulating. Do you want to give it 
another try?
Chandler  So you never had sex with a Kennedy, have you?
Joey  Do, do you gonna do it now?
Monica  We don’t have much time. Once the egg descended the oviduct 
…
Joey  No-ohoh. (the Bings leave, the waiter comes)
Maitre D’  I sincerely hope the rest of your party is returning.
Joey  Nah, just me. All alone. (all the food is served) Dinner for six 
for one, uh, you boys are about to see something really special.
[Scene  continues, Joey finished everything.]
Waiter  How was everything, sir?
Joey  Excellent. The shrew in particular was exclusive.
Waiter  Well, I hope, you got some room left.
Waiters  (with birthday cake, singing) Happy birthday to you, happy 
birthday to you, happy birthday dear …
Joey  Joey! Joey.
Waiters  … Joey, happy birthday to you.
Joey  That’s the best birthday ever.

[Scene  Chandler's hotel room in Tulsa. He's fast asleep when the telephone 
  rings.]
Chandler  (picking up the telephone, answering it with a frog 
  in his throat) Hello? (he clears his throat, but he still has the same frog 
  in his throat when he speaks again) Hello?
Monica  (in her apartment, screaming) I LOVE MY NEW JOB!
Chandler  Honey, you're screaming.
Chandler  (yawning) Oh, that's great.
Monica  Yeah, a-a-and clean. Not just health department clean... 
  Monica clean.
Chandler  (clearly not so interested) Awesome.
Monica  Oh, and the people are so nice. There's this one guy, 
  Geoffrey, he's the Maitre D., Chandler, you will love him. He is without a doubt, 
  the funniest guy I have ever met. (Chandler, who was almost asleep again, sits 
  up straight in bed in an instant and can't believe what he just heard.)
[Scene  Central Perk. Phoebe and Mike are on the couch, holding hands, while 
  Phoebe puts milk in her coffee.]
Mike  This is nice.
Phoebe  I know! (Phoebe picks up a little packet of sugar, 
  shakes it, and then realises she can't open it with one hand, but doesn't want 
  to let go of Mike's hand. She tries to tear open the packet with one hand.)
Mike  You need both hands for that?
Phoebe  Yeah, I kinda do. (Mike lets go of her hand) Well, 
  how's this? (she takes Mike's hand and puts it on her breast, she tears open 
  the sugar and puts it in her coffee. Mike thinks it over and nods appreciative. 
  After that, they hold hands again. Joey now enters, and sees the two sitting 
  on the couch, holding hands.)
Joey  (in a very aaaaahhhhh sweeeeeet voice) Aaahhh, look 
  at you two... holding hands... huh is this getting serious? (Phoebe and Mike, 
  embarrassed, start babbling and look away.) Have you not talked about it yet? 
  (They say nothing now, but smile) Am I making you uncomfortable? (smiles are 
  becoming forced now, and he speaks to Mike) If you were bigger you'd hit me, 
  huh...? Aaaaaahhhhhh (he turns away to the bar)
Phoebe  I'm sorry... I'm sorry. It's obviously way too early 
  for us to be... having that conversation.
Mike  Is it?
Phoebe  (in a flash she answers) Maybe not, is it?
Mike  Okay, when I got divorced, I didn't think I'd feel this 
  way about someone for a really long time... Then again, I didn't think I'd meet 
  someone like you... and... this may be crazy soon, but... I want you to have 
  this... (He tries to get something from his pocket, but it's not that easy... 
  Phoebe looks in a "what's happening" face to him. He finally has found 
  something) No, not... that's gum. (He digs in a little more.) Ooh, five bucks... 
  I love it when that happens, you know... Think no note's there...
Phoebe  (impatient) I know Mike, why don't you keep digging?
Mike  Oh, sorry. (He digs in again and finally finds what 
  he's been looking for. A key.)
Phoebe  Oh, it's a key. To be honest, I think I'd prefer the 
  five dollars.
Mike  It's to my apartment.
Phoebe  (really surprised) Oh wow, ooh! Ooh, big step for 
  Phoebe and Mike.
Mike  Yeah, look, and I don't want you to feel like you have 
  to give me your key just because...
Phoebe  Oh no, I want to.
Mike  Oh, thank God. (he laughs nervously, and Phoebe gets 
  her keychain from her bag.)
Phoebe  Yeah... ooh... wow... Even started to think I'd never 
  meet someone that, you know, I wanted to... do this with. Here you go. (Both 
  Phoebe and Mike look really proud.)
Mike  Is this cool, huh?
Phoebe  It really is.
Joey  (sitting at his table) Oh, I know it... It 
  is amazing these little things open doors... huh! (mimes opening a door with 
  his own keys, Phoebe looks at him in a "yeah, yeah, yeah" way.)
[Scene  Ross and Rachel's apartment. Both of them sitting on the couch, interviewing 
  a nanny candidate.]
Rachel  So I don't go back to work for another four weeks, 
  but we would like our nanny to start right away, so that Emma could get a chance 
  to know her.
Prospective nanny  (in a sweet, caring voice) I think that's 
  really smart. The easier we can make the transition for her, the better. (Ross 
  and Rachel seem pleased with the answer.)
Rachel  That's great, great. So do you have any questions 
  for us?
Prospective nanny  Not really.
Rachel  Allright. Well thank you so much for coming... (they're 
  standing up and make their way to the door)
Ross  Thank you.
Rachel  Really nice to meet you... and we'll call you.
Prospective nanny  Oh, you know, wait. I do have 
  one question. (she starts playing with her hair) Do you guys do random drug 
  testing?
Ross  Boy, we uhm... hadn't really thought of that.
Prospective nanny  That's cool. But... but if you do, I'm 
  gonna need three days notice.
Rachel  Okidoki! (and she slams the door in the nanny's face 
  while Ross crumples up the application form) Wow! We're never gonna find a nanny.
Ross  Oh, come on Rach, we will. I promise. We have more interviews 
  (They sit down and Rachel sighs) And worse comes to worse, we can always reconsider 
  the uhm... the first one we met with.
Rachel  (indignant) What, the blonde with no bra?
Ross  She was blonde? (he looks surprised for a while, but 
  then gets a "gotcha" expression on his face... There's knocking at 
  the door.) Just a sec.! Okay, okay. This one's name is Sandy. She's got a degree 
  in early childhood education, uhm... she worked for her last family for three 
  years.
Rachel  Okay... (Ross opens the door.)
Sandy  (a guy) Hi... I'm Sandy.
Ross  And she's a little mannish...
[Scene  Phoebe's apartment. There's a knock on the door, and Phoebe opens it.]
Phoebe  (gasps) Oh my God! David!
David  Hi! I-i-is this a bad time?
Phoebe  (excited) No! It's a great time, come in...! WOW, 
  hi... Oh my gosh! What are you doing here? Are you back from Minsk?
David  Well, just for a couple of days, uhm... I'm here to 
  explain to the people who gave us our grant, why it's a positive thing that 
  we spent all their money and uhm... accomplished uhm... nothing.
Phoebe  Who cares, it got you here.
David  Well, it got me to New York anyway, and then I got 
  on a cab at the airport, and the guy said where to? and I just... gave him your 
  address I... I... I didn't even think about it.
Phoebe  Wow. Where is your luggage? (David thinks for a while)
David  Damn it!
Phoebe  A-Allright, well... I'll call the cab company.
David  Wa... wa... wait! We can... call them later. Can you 
  just... just stand there f-f-for a moment? Boy! There's an old Russian expression, 
  uhm... it goes Schto ya ztez vigul... ui! Roughly translated that 
  means uhm... This thing that I'm looking at
Phoebe  Thank you! God, no! You should see me when... Oh actually, 
  no, I look pretty good.
Phoebe  No...
[Scene  Monica and Chandler's apartment. Monica sits on the couch and Phoebe 
  is pacing up and down the room.]
Phoebe  I'm... I'm just... I'm the worst person ever. How 
  can I not tell David that I'm seeing Mike?
Monica  Maybe he didn't give you a chance.
Monica  Oh, well... That had been your window.
Monica  Really? The scientist guy?
Phoebe  Really? Chandler?
Monica  Continue...
Phoebe  Oh.Okay, then it gets worse, 'cause then I told him 
  that I would see him tomorrow night.
Monica  Phoebe!
Phoebe  I know! (points at herself) Evil! And... and... and... 
  I like Mike so much, you know. It's just going really well. Oh my God!
Monica  Wow, isn't it ironic that David would show up on the 
  same day that you and Mike exchange keys?
Phoebe  (sarcastically) Uhuh... Yeah...!, you know. And given 
  my life long search for irony, you can imagine how happy I am.
Monica  What are you gonna do?
Phoebe  I mean I guess, I just have to... tell David that 
  nothing can happen between us. Unless I don't... You know, complicated 
  moral situation, no right, no wrong...
Monica  You have to tell David!
Phoebe  Okay, I knew I should have had this conversation 
  with Joey.
[Scene  The hallway between the two apartments. Chandler comes home.]
Chandler  (angry) Funniest guy she's ever met! (to the door) 
  I'm funny, right...? What do you know, you're a door... You just like knock-knock 
  jokes... (laughs about himself, but then gets determined again) Save it for 
  inside! (he enters)
Monica  Heeeeeey!
Chandler  Hey!
Phoebe  Hey!
Chandler  So... Oklahoma is a crazy place. You know, they 
  call it the Sooner state. Frankly I'd sooner be in any other state. (Monica 
  looks at Phoebe, who also doesn't know what to say.) And what's with Oklahoma 
  having a pan handle? Can all states have stuff like that? Hey yeah, I'm from 
  the waistband, Wyoming. But when I was seven, we headed over to the crotch.
Monica  (Doesn't believe what she's hearing) Was your cabin 
  pressurised?
Chandler  (laughs, but then moves to Phoebe) And don't get 
  me started on the way that people from Tulsa talk.
Phoebe  Okay. (and she walks away)
Chandler  What's with the word y'all? You know, just... two 
  words just... pushed together... Are we all allowed to do that, because if so, 
  I say why stop there? You know, your new poodle could be your noodle. And fried 
  chicken? Could be fricken.Waiter, waiter excuse me, I'll have the fricken? (Monica 
  laughs) See, that's... that's funny with the fricken, right?
Monica  No, it just remind me of something this guy did today 
  at work. I told you about that funny guy, Geoffrey, right?
Chandler  Yeah, he came up...
Monica  Well, he did this bit... You probably had to be there, 
  but it was Liza Minelli locked in our freezer, eating a raw chicken. (Phoebe 
  bursts out in a laugh)
Chandler  (to Phoebe) Were you there?
Phoebe  No, but it sounds like it was fricken funny...
[Scene  Ross and Rachel's apartment. They're interviewing Sandy.]
Sandy  I really do understand how hard it's gotta be to leave 
  your child with another person. I mean, it's leaving behind a piece of your 
  heart... (Ross has got that bored/angry/skeptic look and Rachel is very emotional)
Rachel  Sandy, that's exactly what it is...
Ross  Are you gay? (Rachel turns to Ross in an embarrassed 
  way)
Rachel  Ross!
Sandy  It's okay. I get that a lot doing what I do. But I 
  am straight. I-I'm engaged actually.
Rachel  Oh!
Sandy  Her name is Deliah.
Rachel  Oh, that's pretty.
Ross  (skeptic) So you're just like a... guy who's a nanny?
Sandy  I realise how it's... a bit unorthodox for some people, 
  but I really believe, the most satisfying thing you can do with your life, is 
  take care of a child.
Ross  (on a yeah, right tone) Okay.
Sandy  Like in my last job, I met Daniel when he was three 
  weeks old. And I got to watch him grow into this awesome person... 
  When I left, I said I'll see you soon... And he said to me
Ross  Yeah, kids say all kinds of crap. (In the other room 
  Emma starts to cry.)
Rachel  Oh God, she mu... she must need her diaper changed.
Sandy  Oh, oh, I can do it for her, if you want...
Rachel  Oh, that would be great! (Sandy leaves for Emma's 
  room) I love him, I love him, I love him...
Ross  Oh, come on, Rach, he's a guy!
Rachel  So wh..? He's smart, he's qualified. Give me one good 
  reason we shouldn't try him out.
Ross  Because, it's weird!
Rachel  Why?
Ross  What kind of job is that for a man? A nanny? I-It's 
  like if a woman wanted to be...
Rachel  (she's got that "yeah, try to say it" look 
  on her face) Yes?
Ross  King?
Sandy  I er... I hope you don't mind. I used some of my home-made 
  lotion on Emma. It's a mixture of calendula and honey cream. It'll dry that 
  rash right up. Plus... It keeps the hands young... (it makes Rachel smile)
Rachel  (whispering and begging) Please? (Ross makes a "whatever" 
  gesture) YES! Sandy you're hired.
Sandy  That's great! (He gets emotional again and waves his 
  hand in front of his face in a feminine way, like trying to dry his tears) I'm 
  sorry. It's just... such an emotional thing when you're welcomed into a new 
  family...
Rachel  Oooh... ***I really can't hear what she says*** come here.
Ross  You gotta be at least bi...
[Scene  Joey's apartment. Joey is reading a 'Busty Ladies' magazine when Chandler 
  enters.]
Chandler  Hey! (Joey doesn't look up, but gestures 'wait a 
  minute' with his finger while he finishes reading the article. Chandler waits 
  for Joey to finish.) I need you to set me up for a joke. Later, when Monica 
  is around, I need you to ask me about fire trucks.
Joey  Ooh. I-I don't know Chan. I'm not so good with remembering 
  lines.
Chandler  (Can't believe what he hears) Well, thank God your 
  livelihood doesn't depend on it.
Joey  I know, right? (Chandler has really big eyes, and nods) 
  Wh... Wh... Why are we doing this?
Chandler  Monica says that her Maitre D. is the funniest guy 
  she's ever met.
Joey  Seriously? She actually said that?
Chandler  Yes! Am I crazy to be this upset?
Joey  Nooooo! Being funny is your thing!
Chandler  Yeah!
Joey  Without that, you just got "lame with women".
Chandler  Ye.... (stops because he realises what Joey just 
  said, and stares at him. At this moment Monica enters)
Monica  Hi! There you are.
Joey  (sees Monica) Fire trucks! (Chandlers eyes double in 
  size and he turns to Monica who doesn't understand what's happening. Then he 
  turns back to Joey, who says "you're welcome" without a sound)
[Scene  Phoebe's apartment. Phoebe just let David in who brought a bottle of 
  wine.]
David  Wow, you look even... more beautiful than you did yesterday.
Phoebe  Oof...
David  In fact, ehm... I going to kiss you now. (David holds 
  Phoebe and wants to kiss her.)
Phoebe  Oh, wait, wait!
David  Yeah, I-I don't, I can't get away with stuff like that. 
  I-I-It sounded sexy in my head, so I...
Phoebe  No, no, it's not that. (they go sit on the couch) 
  Uhm... Remember when you asked me if I was seeing someone and I said no? Well, 
  uhm... I am. His ... his name is Mike.
David  Oh... oh...
Phoebe  Yeah, I should have told you.
David  No... well, yeah.
Phoebe  I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
David  Well, i-it's okay. I-I-I understand... Well, s... well, 
  are you happy with this guy?
Phoebe  I am happy.
David  Damn it! I-I'm sorry. I-I don't mean that. I-I want 
  you to be happy... But only with me. No, uhm... that's not fair. Uh, who cares, 
  leave him!. Oh, I don't mean that. Yes I do... I'm sorry Uhm, I... I think I 
  should probably uhm... go...
Phoebe  Well... but David, just... I just want you to know 
  that... that... you know... telling you this... is one of the hardest things 
  I've ever had to do.
David  Well... just so you know... hearing it wasn't exactly 
  a Vladnik carnival either... Can we at least hug goodbye?
Phoebe  Of course, yeah.(they hug and Phoebe sighs... a little 
  after that also David sighs and makes his way to the door) You know, a kiss 
  on the cheek wouldn't be totally inappropriate...
David  No... no...
Phoebe  I mean... (David kisses Phoebe on the cheek, makes 
  his way to the door and turns around again)
David  In Minsk...
Phoebe  Yeah?
David  ...it's uhm... i-it's two on each cheek and uhm... 
  and one on the lips.
Phoebe  Well, if that's what they do in Minsk... (They kiss 
  2 on each cheek... and then they pause... David turns to the door) In New York... 
  it's... (and then David grabs her by her neck and kisses her full on the lips... 
  They kiss passionately and cannot seem to stop.)
[Scene  Ross and Rachel's apartment. Rachel and Sandy sit on the couch. Sandy 
  holds Emma. Ross enters the apartment. Sandy and Rachel wipe their tears away 
  with handkerchiefs]
Rachel  (in a tearful voice) Oh... Oh boy... (she turns around 
  and sees Ross) Hi...
Ross  (very worried) Is everything allright?
Rachel  Oh yeah, it's fine, it's fine. Sandy was just... was 
  just telling me about how he proposed to his fiancée and it was just 
  sooo beautiful.
Sandy  Well, her favourite flower is the camellia. From the 
  poem...
Rachel  I can't... I can't hear it again.
Sandy  You know, I can't tell it again... (wipes his tears 
  again)
Ross  And I'm fine never having heard it... (Rachel looks 
  at Ross in a "why do you say that" manner) Rach, can I... can I see 
  you for a sec?
Rachel  Yeah! (to Sandy) Excuse me... (She walks to the kitchen 
  with Ross and sighs)
Ross  Do you realise that man has cried in our apartment three 
  times...? Huh? I haven't cried that many times since I moved in.
Rachel  Look, Ross, he's just... Sandy is just sensitive, 
  that's all.
Ross  (picks up a cookie) Okay, okay, see... that... that 
  is the problem. He is too sensitive. (takes a bite from the cookie)
Rachel  What...? Too sensitive to take care of our baby?
Ross  (speaking with his mouth full) Yeah, I mean, all things 
  that guy... (looks at the cookie) These are amazing!
Rachel  Sandy made Madeleines.
Ross  This... this is exactly what I'm talking about. What 
  kind of a guy makes... makes... delicate French cookies, huh? They're not even... 
  butch, manly cookies with... with... you know with... with chunks. (takes a 
  careful bite from the cookie)
Rachel  Well, I... you know, I-I-I don't know what to say... 
  I mean, I never thought of you as a guy who needed his men to be men. 
  You know, 'cause I gotta tell you Ross, it not like you just came in 
  from branding cattle.
Ross  Hey... there's sensitive... and there is too sensitive.
Rachel  Okay, what? What is too sensitive? (There's 
  music coming from the living room. Ross opens the door to the living room and 
  he and Rachel see Sandy play a song for Emma on his recorder. Rachel is moved 
  by this, but Ross only sees his point proven again, and walks back into the 
  kitchen, angrily. The door he was holding, swings back and hits Rachel.)
[Scene  Phoebe's apartment. She and David are still kissing each other in the 
  living room.]
Phoebe  Hmmm... No, no... No, I can't do this. It's bad.
David  But... I-I-It's nice... A-a-and... nice is good. A-a-and 
  good is not bad, ergo, w-w-we should keep kissing.
Phoebe  No, no. No.
David  But... ergo...
Phoebe  Look David, if... if you had never left, then... yeah, 
  we'd probably still be together right now, but... you did leave, and I-I'm with 
  Mike and I really care about him...
David  Uhm... uhm... Goodbye... Uh... Schto ya ztez vigul... 
  ui... (David holds his hands gently on the back of Phoebe's neck. There's 
  a sound of a a bunch of keys rattling, and the door opens... It's Mike)
Mike  Well... hey, the key works...! (he looks as if he doesn't 
  want to believe what's happening)
Phoebe  (points to David) And you thanks for the 
  face massage. Thank you.
[Scene  Monica and Chandler's apartment. Monica is in the kitchen and Ross 
  enters.]
Ross  Did Rachel tell you we hired a male nanny?
Monica  Yeah! I think that's great!
Ross  Oh really? Did she tell you he plays the recorder, recites 
  poetry and bakes Madeleines?
Monica  Oh... How are they?
Ross  (looks like in heaven) Lighter than air... (changes 
  back to serious) But that's not the point. (Joey now also enters)
Joey  Hey!
Ross  Hey...! Rachel and I hired a male nanny.
Joey  (looks surprised) Really...? Guys do that...? That's... 
  weird...
Ross  Thank you!
Joey  That's like a woman wanting to be a...
Ross  ...a what? A what? What's the end of that sentence?
Monica  Yes... What is the end of that sentence?
Joey  Uhm... A penis model. (Monica can't believe what's she's 
  hearing and Ross pats Joey on the back.) Anyway, hey... Did you tell Chandler 
  that some guy from work is the funniest guy you've ever met?
Monica  Yeah, so?
Ross  Wow!
Joey  Really? Do you not know Chandler?
Monica  Is that why he's acting so weird...? He's jealous...? 
  Oh my God, that is crazy. It's not like I'm attracted to Geoffrey...
Joey  So what? Being funny is Chandler's thing... 
  You know, like Ross's thing is... (he can't come up with anything)
Ross  Science...? Academia...? Being a good father...?
Joey  ...No... (he just can't seem to grasp it)
Monica  I can't believe he's that upset about this...
Joey  Monica, you have to do some damage control here, okay. 
  'Cause he's feeling like... (the door opens and Chandler walks in with a pizza)
Chandler  Hey!
Joey  Heeeyy! Hey!
Chandler  What are you guys talking about?
Ross  Uhm... Rachel and I hired a male nanny. (Joey makes 
  a gesture and sound like "Can you believe that?")
Chandler  You got a man who's a nanny...? You got a manny...? 
  (Monica starts laughing, but very exaggerated. Joey realises they also should 
  laugh and punches Ross. Now all three of them laugh, but very fake. Chandler 
  seems happy again.)
Chandler  You know, I don't mind a... male nanny, but I do 
  draw the line at a male wetnurse. (again they laugh, even more fake than before)
Monica  Ohhh, ooohhh... you are on a roll, mister!
Chandler  If I'd known you guys were coming over, I would 
  have brought more pizza. (they all burst out in a thundering laugh)
Monica  Okay, okay... Chandler you... you stop it! (Monica 
  wipes away tears)
Chandler  What is so funny about that? (they realise 
  it wasn't a joke)
Monica  Well, I don't know... I-It's... just the way you say 
  it... I mean, you're funny... You have that funny thing. You're a funny guy! 
  (Chandler turns to Joey)
Chandler  Did you tell her what we talked about? (Joey starts 
  laughing hysterically, but then gets serious again...)
Joey  Yeah....
Chandler  So those were pity laughs? PITY LAUGHS? (Joey and 
  Ross walk away from the kitchen)
Monica  Honey, listen... You have nothing to worry about with 
  Geoffrey.
Chandler  Oh yeah? Is he funnier than me?
Monica  Well, you're... you're different funny... I mean, 
  you're... you're more sarcastic a-a-and... well, he does... bits... and impressions... 
  and... and limericks...
Chandler  I do limericks... uhm... There once was a man named 
  Chandler, whose wife made him die inside.
Monica  Honey, you know I think you're hilarious! Come on, 
  you know that joke you told me last week? The one about Jerry Lewis and the 
  girl with the lazy eye...? (he laughs) That slayed me.
Ross  Hey... I made up that joke and told it to you! (He points 
  at Chandler. Joey gestures to Ross "What are you doing?)
Joey  Not knowing when to shut up...
Ross  Yep! That's my thing...
[Scene  Phoebe's apartment. David is still there. Mike closes the door.]
Mike  So... how many guys have your key?
Phoebe  No, no, no, no, no... It's not... it's not... i'ts 
  not as bad as it looks... really. I was just saying goodbye to an old friend.
Mike  Your lipstick's on his mouth.
David  Oh, uh... we just uh... happen to wear the same shade.
Phoebe  No, uhm... David and I did use to go out... but years 
  ago, and he lives in Minsk. He's only... he's only in town for a couple of days.
Mike  Did you uhm...
Phoebe  No, no...
Mike  ...kiss him?
Phoebe  Oh, well, yeah...
David  Yes, but uhm... You should know... she really likes 
  you. I-In fact I-I-I don't think you realise j-just how lucky you are fella. 
  (he points at Mike)
Mike  Don't point your finger at me.
David  Why? Wh-What are you going to do about it?
Mike  Well... I'll... just show you what I'm gonna do about 
  it... (he hits David's finger with his finger and they start to finger-fight 
  using their fingers as swords saying all kinds of macho crap)
Phoebe  Stop it! Stop it, before someone gets really hurt! 
  (they stop and Phoebe gets David's jacket and gives it to him) Here David, you 
  should just go.
David  Allright... But... if I ever do come back 
  from Minsk... (points at Mike) well, you just better watch out.
Mike  Well, if I ever goto Minsk, you'd 
  better watch out.
David  Oh, you're going to Minsk?
Mike  Well, I might.
David  Really? Well, if you do, come in the spring. It's just 
  lovely there.
Phoebe  Okay, well... guys?
David  Right... Goodbye Phoebe. (Makes a move to kiss her.)
Mike  Hey, what are you kidding me?
David  Right-o, right-o... (to Mike) Take good care of her. 
  (and he leaves)
Phoebe  I'm sorry, I'm so sorry. If you... If you want your 
  key back, I totally understand.
Mike  It's never gonna happen again right?
Phoebe  Right! Never! Never! I swear! (They kiss... The door 
  opens and David comes in again.)
David  I-I... Oh I...I just wanna say uhm... if you do ever 
  come to Minsk, that's my number (gives Mike a business card) We'll uhm... we'll 
  party up Vladnik style. (He leaves again)
[Scene  Ross walks in the hallway to his apartment and stops in front of his 
  own door. Now he hears two recorders playing a song. When he enters, Sandy and 
  Joey are playing the recorder and Rachel listens.]
Joey  Yeah! Allright! Hey, hey Ross. Check it out! Sandy taught 
  me Hot-cross Buns.
Ross  Really? Sounded like Three Blind Mice.
Joey  Noooo... Three Blind Mice goes like this... (he puts 
  his fingers in position on the recorder)
Ross  (looks angrily at Joey and points at him) I swear to 
  God...! (Joey is in shock)
Sandy  Who's up for puppets?
Joey  Me! I'm up for puppets!
Sandy  Well, please welcome... The Snufflebumps... Who wants 
  to be mr. Wigglemunch and who's gonna be the Grumpus?
Ross  Okay, okay... How exactly is a two month old supposed 
  to appreciate puppets?
Sandy  Actually studies have shown that the movement and colours 
  help their cerebral development... The whimsical characters are just for us. 
  (He winks to Joey and Rachel. Ross's face says he disapproves. Joey sees that 
  and kind of angrily says...)
Joey  I wanna be mr. Wigglemunch. (and makes a "there" 
  nod to Ross)
Ross  (shakes his head) Oh my God!
Sandy  Well, I guess we know who's gonna be the Grumpus... 
  (Ross goes to the kitchen)
[Scene  Ross and Rachel's kitchen. Ross got a beer from the refrigerator and 
  opens the bottle. Rachel now also enters the kitchen.]
Rachel  That was kind of rude!
Ross  Oh, I'm sorry. Please apologise to Sandy and the Snufflebumps 
  for me.
Rachel  You know, he was just doing his job...
Ross  Well, you know what... I-I'm sorry I'm the only one 
  who isn't in love with Gary Poppins out there... But I just... I can't... I 
  can't go through with this.
Rachel  Oh, come on Ross...
Ross  No! Hey, you know what? I'm sorry. I would never force 
  you... to hire someone you were this uncomfortable with...
Rachel  (sighs) Oh... That's true.
Ross  Thank you!
Rachel  Well, you're the one who wants to fire him, so you're 
  gonna have to do it. (Ross walks to the living room determined to fire Sandy)
[Scene  Living room. Joey and Sandy are talking with the Snufflebumps.]
Sandy  (In a puppet voice) So you see Wigglemunch, that's 
  why it's important to shaaaaaaare...
Joey  (kind of emotional) I am learning so much from you.
[Scene  Monica and Chandler's apartment. Monica and Joey are sitting at the 
  dinner table. Chandler comes from the bedroom with his suitcase.]
Chandler  Well, I'm off to Tulsa, so if your Maitre D. friend 
  has any funny Oklahoma jokes, tell him to e-mail me at www.hahanotsomuch.com.
Monica  Honey, you can relax. Last night at work, Geoffrey 
  told this really sexist joke. After that, not so funny anymore.
Monica  Okay, don't miss that flight. You know I love you.
Chandler  I love you too. (Monica and Chandler kiss. He turns 
  to Joey.) And... I like you as a friend. (They hug and pat each other on the 
  back.)
Joey  Allright. See you later!
Chandler  See ya! (he leaves the apartment)
Joey  (to Monica) Did that guy really make that joke?
Monica  Naaaa... He still kills me. Last night he had me laughing 
  so hard, I swear... a little pee came out.
[Scene  Ross and Rachel's apartment. Sandy is knitting baby clothes. Ross and 
  Rachel walk into the living room.]
Ross  Here goes...
Rachel  I can't watch. It's like firing Elmo. (Ross walks 
  to the couch where Sandy sits)
Ross  Sandy... Hi, we uhm... we kinda need to talk. I'm afraid 
  it's not working out.
Sandy  (surprised) Oh...
Ross  Yeah, uhm... I mean, Rachel and I, think you are great... 
  with Emma... uhm... We just feel...
Rachel  (from behind the bedroom door) YOU! You feel!
Ross  I... just feel that the... the chemistry isn't right. 
  I'm sorry. We're... we're more than happy to give you good recommendation...
Sandy  Oh, no, no, no... That's okay. I got a lot of offers 
  from other families. I just picked you guys because... I liked you the best.
Rachel  (from bedroom) Oh, damn you Geller!
Ross  Anyway, uhm...Well, I'm glad there's no hard feelings.
Sandy  No, none at all. You need to be happy with whoever 
  is in your home... Although if you don't mind telling me, what was your problem? 
  Maybe it's something I can work on in the future.
Ross  No, you know, it's uhm... nothing you did, it's... it's 
  uhm... my issue.
Sandy  What is it...? (Ross hesitates) Please...? (he tilts 
  his head)
Ross  You know, I'm just not uhm... that comfortable with 
  a guy who's as sensitive as you.
Sandy  That's fair... Although, can I ask... why do you think 
  that is?
Ross  Why... I... I don't know. (Sandy tilts his head again) 
  Uhm... errrr... maybe... maybe because of my father?
Sandy  hmmm... (and shakes his head)
Ross  I mean, uhm... you know when I was growing up he was 
  kind of a tough guy... You know a-a-and as a kid I wasn't the athlete I am now.
Rachel  (from the bedroom) Huh ha ha!
Ross  I play squash...! Anyway, uhm... I uhm... I always get 
  the feeling he thought I was too sensitive.
Sandy  That must have been hard.
Ross  It was hard... I remember... I was in my bedroom... 
  playing with my dinosaurs... playing and learning... and my father 
  walks in and says... he says... "What are you doing with those things? 
  What's wrong with you, why aren't you... why aren't you outside playing like 
  a... like a real boy?
Sandy  But you are a real boy!
Ross  I know I am! (Ross now starts to cry) ...And when it's 
  summer, and it's hot, why can't you wear a tank top?
Sandy  It's allright! Crying is good. It lets the boo-hoos 
  out.
Ross  Here come some more...
[Scene  Joey's apartment. Joey and Sandy are sitting at the kitchen counter. 
  Joey is holding mr. Wigglemunch, and Sandy holds the Grumpus.]
Sandy/Grumpus  And what's the one kind of boat that can never, 
  ever sink?
Joey/Wigglemunch  What kind?
Sandy/Grumpus  A friend-ship...
Joey  Wow! You blow my mind...
Sandy  Oh, I gotta go.
Joey  Aaahh... How much do I owe you?
Sandy  Twenty bucks.
Joey  It's like the cheapest college ever.
[Scene  Ross and Rachel's apartment. Ross is playing with Emma on the couch 
  after just changing her diaper.]
Ross  And that's why, no matter what mommy says, we really 
  were on a break. (baby talk) Yes we were! Yes we were! (picks Emma up) Come 
  here gorgeous. (puts her on his knees and talks to her) Oh! Look at you! You 
  are the cutest little baby ever! You're just a... a little bitty baby, you know 
  that? But you've got... (in a softer voice) You've got big beautiful eyes... 
  Yes you do... and a... and a big round belly. (emphasises the B's) Big baby 
  butt! I like big butts. (raps) I like big butts and I cannot lie / you other 
  brothers can't deny / when a girl walks in with an itty, bitty, waist / and 
  a round thing in your face you get...(Emma laughs) Oh my God, Emma... you're 
  laughing! Oh my God, you've never done that before, have you? You never done 
  that before... Daddy made you laugh, huh? Well, daddy and Sir Mix Alot... What? 
  What? You... you wanna hear some more? Uhm...(raps) My anaconda don't want 
  none / unless you got buns hon... (Emma laughs again and Ross looks worried) 
  I'm a terrible father!
[Scene  Central Perk. Joey sits at a table and Chandler and Monica enter.]
Chandler  Hi!
Joey  Hey... hey listen... What do you guys know about investments?
Chandler  How come?
Joey  Well, I'm starting to make good money on the show and 
  I'm thinking... I should probably do something with it.
Monica  What do you do with your money now?
Joey  Well, I just tape it to the back of my toilet tank. 
  (realises that anyone could have overheard that) I didn't say that! It's in 
  a bank guarded by robots!
Chandler  Do you have any ideas?
Joey  Uh, yeah... This guy at work got me excited about going 
  in on an emu farm. That'd be kinda cool huh? Pitchin' in on the weekends, helping 
  to plant the emus...
Monica  Joe... Emus are birds. You raise them for meat.
Monica  Joey, I think you should consider something a little 
  less risky. I mean, I think in this market, real estate is your best investment.The 
  Fed. just lowered the rates and the interest on your mortgage is totally deductible. 
  (looks at Chandler) That's right, I know some stuff!
Joey  Real estate, huh? Hmmm...
Monica  (very excited) Oh, and you know who's selling a great 
  apartment? Richard!
Chandler  (imitating Monica) Oh, and you know whose knowledge 
  of her ex-boyfriend is shocking? Monica!
Monica  My dad told me. They play golf together.
Chandler  Oh, well... Maybe I'll join them some time. I just 
  hope the club doesn't slip out of my hand and beat the moustache off his face.
[Scene  Monica and Chandler's apartment. Rachel and Monica are sitting at the 
  dinner table and Phoebe enters, knocking on the door.]
Phoebe  Hi!
Rachel and Monica  Hey!
Phoebe  Listen! You have to help me pick a dress 'cause I'm 
  meeting Mike's parents tonight! (Rachel gasps)
Monica  Wow, the boyfriend's parents! That's a big step.
Phoebe  (sarcastically) Really? That hadn't occurred to me.
Monica  They just gonna love you, just be yourself.
Phoebe  They live on the upper east side on Park Avenue!
Rachel  Oh yeah, she can't be herself.
Phoebe  Okay, so... allright... Which dress? (she holds up 
  two 'Phoebe' dresses, Rachel and Monica look at them... taking their time, don't 
  wanting to hurt Phoebe) You can say "neither".
Rachel and Monica  Oh God, neither!
Monica  I'm sorry honey, but we're gonna take you shopping. 
  It's gonna be fine.
Monica  You went out with Wallis Pincer?
Rachel  Uh, he took the SAT's for me.
Monica  I knew you didn't get a 1400!
Rachel  Ssshyeah, well, duh! I mean...
Phoebe  So... now... What about with Mike's mom?
Rachel  Oh, with the mother, just... just constantly tell 
  her how amazing her son is. Take it from me, moms love me. Ross's mom one time 
  actually said I'm like the daughter that she never had.
Monica   (Monica looks at Rachel in disbelief) She said WHAT?
Phoebe  (speaking louder and articulating) That's she's like 
  the daughter she never had. (Phoebe points at her ears) Listen! (Monica looks 
  at Phoebe in a duh! way)
[Scene  Ross and Rachel's apartment. Rachel enters the apartment.]
Rachel  Hi.
Ross  Hi.
Rachel  I just finished getting Phoebe all dressed to meet 
  Mike's parents. She's so nervous, it's so sweet!
Ross  Guess what? I made Emma laugh today.
Rachel  (in disbelief) You WHAT? And I missed it? Because 
  I was giving a makeover to that stupid hippie?
Ross  Yeah, and it was uhm... it was like a real little person 
  laugh too. It was... it was like uhm... (Ross tries to impersonate Emma's laugh, 
  but it comes out very squeaky, very high pitched. He laughs about himself but 
  then looks at Rachel, realises that it sounded weird and straightens his face.) 
  Only... only not creepy.
Rachel  Well... well, what did you do to make her laugh? (excited)
Ross  I uhm... Well, I sang... (Rachel gasps) well actually 
  I rapped... Baby Got Back... (Rachel's face changes from excited to angry)
Rachel  You WHAT? You sang... to our baby daughter... a song 
  about a guy who likes to have sex with women with giant asses?
Ross  But you know what, if you think about it, it actually 
  promotes a healthy uhm... body image... because... even big butts or uhm... 
  juicy doubles.
Rachel  (disgusted) owwwww...
Ross  Please don't take her away from me!
[Scene  Richard's apartment. There's a knock on the door.The listing agent 
  opens the door for Chandler and Joey.]
Catherine  Oh hi, come on in. I'm Catherine, the listing agent.
Joey  Hi I'm Joey. This is Chandler.
Chandler  So how come Richard's selling the place? Went bankrupt? 
  Medical malpractice? Choked on his own moustache?
Catherine  Actually, he is buying a much bigger place. It's 
  got a great view of Central Pa.....
Chandler  mmm That's enough about you!
Joey  Is there anything we should know about the apartment?
Catherine  All the appliances are included. There is a lot 
  of light, a new kitchen... I think you guys would be very happy here... (Joey 
  and Chandler both realise what she's assuming and start laughing.)
Chandler  No, no, no, no, no, NO! No, no... we're not together. 
  We're not a couple. We're definately not a couple.
Catherine  Oh... Okay, sorry!
Joey  Well, you seem pretty insulted by that. What? I'm not 
  good enough for you?
Chandler  We're not gonna have this conversation again... 
  Look at this place. Why am I so intimidated by this guy? Pretentious art, this 
  huge macho couch. When we know all he does is sit around all day crying about 
  losing Monica to a real man! (laughs) You don't think he's here, do you? (Joey 
  looks around)
Joey  You know what it is? It's a nice place but I gotta see 
  I don't know if I see myself living here. Oh, oh, oh, let me see... (Joey sits 
  down on the couch, mimes opening a can and puts his hand down his pants) Yeah, 
  I could see it.
Chandler  (Chandler looks around the place and his eye gets 
  caught by Richard's video collection) Look at these videos. You know, I mean, 
  who does he think he is? Magnum Force, Dirty Harry, Cool Hand Luke... Oh my 
  God!
Joey  What?
Chandler  There's a tape here with Monica's name on it.
Joey  Ooh! A tape with a girls name on it. It's probably a 
  sex tape... (realises) Wait a minute... This says Monica... (looks around) And 
  this is Richard's apartment... (realises some more)
Chandler  Get there faster! (Joey gasps and finally understands...)
[Scene  Mike's parents building. Phoebe gets out of the classy elevator, looking 
  all dressed up like an older woman, and very un-Phoebe. She walks to the door 
  and rings the doorbell.]
Mike  Wow! You look like... like my mom.
Phoebe  I'm wearing pantyhose!
Mike  Great! Come on in! (Mike kisses her on the cheek. A 
  butler walks in and takes Phoebe's coat.)
Phoebe  Oh, thank you! Oh... Oh my God, you're RICH!
Mike  No, my parents are rich.
Phoebe  Yeah, so... They gotta die someday. (Mike's parents 
  walk in) HELLO!
Phoebe  (in a very posh accent) Theodore... Bitsy... What 
  a delight!
Bitsy  It's so nice to finally meet you!
Phoebe  And you... Your home is lovely.
Bitsy  Well thank you, I'll give you a tour later. It's actually 
  three floors.
Phoebe  Holy crap!
Bitsy  Phoebe, why don't you come in the living room and meet 
  our friends?
Phoebe  Oh, try and stop me!
Mike  Hey... Wh... What are you doing?
Phoebe  (no accent) I'm trying to get your parents to like 
  me.
Mike  Yeah, I'm sure they will, but you don't have to do this... 
  I'm wanting them to get to know Phoebe, not (accent) Phoebe...
Phoebe  (accent) Got it! It... It's hard to stop...
Mike  Well, come on...
Theodore  Phoebe, these are our friends, Tom and Sue Angle.
Bitsy  Phoebe, come sit. Tell us a little bit about yourself... 
  So where are you from?
Phoebe  (no accent) Uhm... Okay, well, allright, uhm... Originally 
  I'm from upstate, but uhm... then my mom killed herself and my stepdad went 
  to prison, so... I just moved to the city where uhm... I actually lived in a 
  burned out Buick LeSabre for a while... (frowns are received) which was okay, 
  that was okay, until uhm... I got hepatitis, you know, 'cause this pimp spit 
  in my mouth and... but I... I got over it and uhm... anyway, now I'm uhm... 
  a freelance massage therapist, uhm... which, you know, isn't always steady money 
  but at least I don't pay taxes, huh... (everyone in the room finds it a bit 
  surreal, which Phoebe realises and starts to talk in the accent again) So... 
  where does everyone summer?
[Scene  Mike's parents house again.]
Phoebe  God! God! This is not going well.
Mike  No, no, no, you're doing fine, really... Why don't you 
  go talk to my dad?
Phoebe  Okay, okay, okay, okay... Still sure about me being 
  myself?
Mike  Absolutely! Or maybe just a little less pimp spit.
Phoebe  So Theodore... I uhm... I can see where Mike gets 
  his good looks from...
Theodore  Oh... Well...
Phoebe  Yeah... And that physique! You must work out all the 
  time...
Theodore  Oh no, not all the time... I do the best I can...
Phoebe  Yeah I bet! Look out! (Phoebe punches Theodore right 
  in the stomach)
Theodore  OH! OWWWWW! (Theodore grabs his stomach in agony)
Phoebe  Oh my God, are you okay?
Theodore  I recently had surgery.
Phoebe  I'm so sorry!
Theodore  No, I'll be fine... I just should check the stitches...
Phoebe  I really, really am sorry.
Theodore  How could you know. Why wouldn't you punch me in 
  the stomach? (Theodore walks out... Mike walks towards Phoebe)
Mike  Uhm... Did you just hit my dad?
Phoebe  Yes... I'm sorry, I've never met a boyfriends parents 
  before...
Mike  But, I mean, you have met... humans before, right? Look, 
  why don't you go talk to my mom?
Phoebe  Yeah okay... yeah, your mom... okay... She looks nice, 
  I can talk to her.
Mike  Yeah, you do that, and I go check my dad for signs of 
  internal bleeding. (Mike walks away and Bitsy walks in the same direction.)
Phoebe  Yeah... Oh Bitsy, hi. Uhm... listen I just wanted 
  to thank you again for having me here tonight.
Bitsy  Well, not at all...
Phoebe  Also uhm... I just want you to know what a wonderful 
  man your son is.
Bitsy  Thank you, I think so too.
Phoebe  Well, and you know, it really is a testament to how 
  he was raised. Especially to you. Because he's very respectful of women.
Bitsy  Is he really?
Phoebe  Are you kidding. He is so considerate of my feelings 
  and... you know I think... you'd also like to know that he is a very gentle 
  lover.
Bitsy  E-e-excuse me?
Phoebe  (Mike now enters and stands behind Phoebe) Oh no, 
  no, no, no, no, no. Don't get me wrong. No, he's not in like a sissy way. No, 
  no, no... when he gets going, he can rattle a headboard like a sailor on leave...
Bitsy  That's... my boy. (Bitsy walks away)
Mike  Awesome!
[Scene  Monica and Chandler's apartment. Only Chandler is there with the videotape 
  in his hands, standing in front of the TV set.]
Chandler  I'm not gonna watch it... I don't NEED to watch 
  it... I mean, what good could possibly come from watching? (sighs) Well, we 
  know I'm gonna watch it. (Chandler moves to put the tape in the VCR and Joey 
  enters the apartment)
Joey  Hey dude, what's up?
Chandler  Don't judge me, I'm only human!
Joey  Did you take that tape?
Chandler  I had to! Okay, imagine you were married... and 
  you found a tape of your wife in another guys' apartment... Wouldn't you need 
  to know what was on it?
Joey  I don't know. Who'm I'm married to?
Chandler  Some girl...!?
Joey  She hot?
Chandler  Yeah...!?
Joey  How did she get me to settle down?
Chandler  Allright, I'm gonna watch it... I mean look, it's 
  probably not even what I think it is... And even if it is... It can't possibly 
  be as bad as what I'm picturing in my head... (laughs nervously) Can it?
Chandler  Then you're gonna have to watch it for me.
Joey  (backs off) What? Whoo... What?
Chandler  Just for a few seconds, so I can know what it is... 
  Please?
Joey  All right, fine... But if I enjoy this, you have only 
  yourself to blame... (Chandler turns his back to the TV. Joey puts the tape 
  in the VCR, switches it on and watches what's on the tape... It's clearly a 
  american football match, with the referee's whistle blowing, the crowds cheering...)
Chandler  Why am I hearing cheering?
Joey  Well it's okay, its like... its just a football game.
Chandler  Football? Just football?
Joey  Yeah, see... you were all worried for nothing.
Chandler  It's football... It's just football... This is great! 
  This is the first time I've ever enjoyed football... It may be customary to 
  get a beer... (Chandler walks to the fridge, his back turned to the TV and a 
  moaning sound replaces the cheering of the crowd... Joey's eyes double in size...) 
  What the... (Chandler turns around, but Joey already took a sprint for Chandler, 
  jumps, and floors Chandler in the open space in front of the apartment door...) 
  What are you doing?
Joey  You don't wanna see what I just saw! (at this moment 
  Monica comes home, and sees Chandler flat on his back on the floor and Joey 
  pinning him down)
Monica  What are you guys doing? (Monica hears the moaning 
  coming from the TV and looks at it) Oh my God, is that Richard? (It only takes 
  a split second for Joey to realise, he pulls Monica down by her jacket, and 
  she falls, face down next to Chandler. Chandler gets up a bit, and Joey quickly 
  covers Chandler's eyes with his hand.)
[Scene  Ross and Rachel's apartment. Emma is sitting in her chair on the apothecary 
  table and Rachel is trying to make her laugh.]
Rachel  Okay... aahhh... Please laugh for mommy... Please? 
  Please laugh for mommy... (Rachel makes a funny face, sticking her tongue out, 
  making a farting noise and using her hands as antlers, wiggling her fingers... 
  No response from Emma...) Not funny huh? Oh so, is it... only offensive novelty 
  rap? Or maybe just, you know, rap in general? 'Cause mommy can rap... (Rachel 
  tries to rap and makes weird movements with her arms in the process.) My 
  name is mommy and I'm here to say / that all the babies are... Oh, I can't 
  rap... Allright sweetheart... This is only because I love you so much, and I 
  know that you're not gonna tell anybody... (Rachel's face is telling "Oh 
  what am I doing? The things I have to go through... and she starts to rap) I 
  like... big butts and I cannot lie... / You other brothers can't deny... / when 
  a girl walks in with an itty bitty waist and a round thing in your face... (Emma 
  starts to laugh) Yes! Yes! Yes! YES! Oohhhhh! Oh! (Rachel now really gets into 
  it, and her insecure movements start getting better) I like big butts and 
  I cannot lie... / You other brothers can't deny... Oh Emma you're laughing! 
  Oh you are, you really do like big butts, don't you. Oh you beautiful little 
  weirdo... (Rachel picks up Emma and Ross now enters)
Ross  Hey!
Rachel  Oh you missed it. She was laughing. Oh it was amazing. 
  It was amazing. It was the most beautiful, beautiful sound that...
Ross  Oh I know, isn't it? Ooh... what'd you do to get her 
  to laugh?
Rachel  Oh! You know, I just... couple of things I tried ... 
  I just sang a little doo... Itsy Bitsy Spider...
Ross  You sang Baby Got Back didn't you?
Rachel  Nothing else worked. That girl is all about the ass...
[Scene  Mike's parents house, the dining room. Mike, Phoebe, Mike's parents 
  and the Angles are there.]
Phoebe  ...and then it goes back to the chorus... Smelly 
  cat, Sme-lly ca-t / I-t's not your fau-lt. And that's the end of the song... 
  I realise that you didn't ask to hear it, but uhm... no-one had spoken in seventeen 
  minutes.
Mike  Phoebe writes lots of great songs. Wha... What was that 
  one you sang the other night that everybody just loved?
Phoebe  Oh, Pervert Parade?
Mike  (sighs) No...
Phoebe  Oh, Ode To A Pubic Hair?
Mike  Stop! (The butler serves dinner)
Phoebe  Oh God! Is that veal?
Mike  Mom, I thought I told you... Phoebe's a vegetarian.
Bitsy  Oh!
Phoebe  Oh no, no, no, no... That's okay, that's okay... I 
  mean, I'm... I am a vegetarian... except for veal... Yeah no, veal I love...
Mike  Phoebe you don't have to eat...
Mike  So...? What do you think? (looks at his parents, which 
  look in disgust)
[Scene  Monica and Chandler's. Monica switches off the VCR. Joey and Chandler 
  are behind the couch.]
Monica  So you stole that tape from Richard's apartment?
Chandler  Whoho ho... Listen to the judgement from the porn 
  star!
Monica  That tape was never meant to be seen by... (pauses) 
  Joey I would feel more comfortable if I was having this conversation in private.
Joey  (laughs) Monica, look... I don't think you and I have 
  any secrets anymore... (Monica keeps looking at Joey) Not ready to joke about 
  it yet, okay, I see you later. (Joey walks out)
Monica  Why in the world would you take this tape and and 
  why would you watch it?
Chandler  Because that's who I am, okay? I'm sure a mature 
  man like Richard could see a tape like that and it wouldn't bother him. Just'd 
  be another saucy anecdote for him to share at his men's club over brandy and 
  moustaches.
Monica  Is all this about you not being able to grow a moustache?
Chandler  This is about you and Richard. He's clearly not 
  over you. He keeps a tape so he can... look at it whenever he wants.
Monica  Isn't that sad? I mean, can you see how pathetic that 
  is? You shouldn't be jealous. You should feel bad for him.
Chandler  Oh, yeah, well, poor Richard. Y'... I can grow a 
  moustache!
Monica  Chandler, this is not our problem. We've got each 
  other. That's all that matters.
Chandler  Yeah, oh, but I just keep picturing you rolling 
  around with him with your cowboy boots in the air...
Monica  Cowboy boots? I've never worn cowboy boots in my whole 
  life! (she turns on the video again)
Chandler  Oh, good, good. Play more, 'cause I wanna see how 
  it ends.
Monica  THAT'S NOT ME!
Chandler  What...? That's not you! Life is good again! Ride 
  'em cowgirl!
Monica  That bastard taped over me! (Chandler's expression 
  changes)
Chandler  Is that a problem?
Monica  I-It's just so insulting! Big spring for a new blank 
  tape, Doctor!
[Scene  Mike's parents house. Dining room again. Both Mike and Phoebe are not 
  at the table, but the others still are.]
Theodore  I can't imagine what he sees in her.
Bitsy  She actually makes me miss that pill-popping ex-wife 
  of his. (Mike walks in) Oh, hello dear...
Mike  Hey, what's going on?
Bitsy  We were just chit-chatting. How's your friend?
Mike  A little better.
Bitsy  By the way, do you know who's moving back into town? 
  Tom and Sue's daughter Jen.
Theodore  You remember her Michael, she's lovely and... well 
  behaved and... single.
Mike  I'm not interested.
Bitsy  Oh, please darling, let's be honest. You can have all 
  the... sailor fun you want with that one, but... let's be real...
Mike  All right, stop! You know, all Phoebe has done tonight 
  is trying to get you to like her. And maybe that hasn't been clear all the time, 
  but she did her best. And yeah... She's a little different than you are...
Bitsy  Michael, a pimp spit in her mouth! (Phoebe almost enters 
  the room, but she hears the discussion and waits and evesdrops next to the door-opening.)
Mike  So what? I mean if even I can get past that, it shouldn't 
  bother you. And you don't have to like her. You just have to accept 
  the fact that I do. I mean, if you even can't be civil to the woman I love...
Bitsy  The woman you what? (Phoebe overheard what Michael 
  said and now enters the room)
Phoebe  Yeah... The woman you what?
Mike  The woman I love... (he walks to Phoebe) I love you... 
  Which is probably something I shouldn't say for the first time in front of my 
  parents... and Tom and Sue...Who are by the way the most sinfully boring I've 
  ever met in my life...
Phoebe  I love you too...
Mike  You do?
Phoebe  YEAH...! How great is this...? (they kiss)
Mike  Wanna get out of here?
Phoebe  Okay.
Mike  Mom, dad, thanks for dinner.
[Scene  Ross and Rachel's. Emma is in her bed and Ross and Rachel are rapping 
  and dancing for her.]
Ross  She sweat, wet. got it going like a turbo 'vette.
Rachel  So fellas
Ross  Yeah!
Rachel  fellas
Ross  Yeah!
Rachel  has your girlfriend got the butt?
Ross  Hell yeah!
Rachel  So shake it! (Rachel slaps Ross's butt on 
  the beat)
Ross  Shake it!
Rachel  Shake it!  (Phoebe, Mike, Chandler, Monica 
  and Joey step in)
Ross  Shake it!
Rachel  Shake that nasty butt...
Ross  Baby got back (Then Ross turns around and sees 
  their friends standing in the doorway)
Rachel  One more time from the top... I like big butts 
  and I cannot lie, you other br... (She also turns and sees the gang)
Ross  Rachel please! That is so inappropriate!
[Scene  Monica and Chandlers apartment.]
Monica  Hey Hon, could you help me get the plates down?
Chandler  Yeah. Hey, here's an idea, why don't we use our
  wedding china today?
Monica  No, I think we should save our china for something
  really special. Like if the Queen of England comes over.
Chandler  Honey, she keeps canceling on us, take the hint.
Monica  What if something gets broken, they're so expensive.
Chandler  What is the point of having them if we never use
  them?
Monica  Ok, but if something gets broken, and then the Queen
  comes over..
Chandler  I will explain it to her.
Monica  <laughs> Oh yeah, like I'm going to let you
  talk to the queen.
Joey  wow, the parade is really good this year. Man those
  horses can crap.
TV announcer  Next up is a marching band from Muskogee, OK.
Joey  Oh my God!
Chandler  Aren't you one of the stars of the popular daytime
  soap Days of Our Lives?
Joey  Yeah! I totally forgot I'm supposed to be there. I
  can't believe I forgot. I usually write stuff like this on my arm.
Chandler  What are you going to do?
Chandler  Well you proved them wrong.
Joey nods  Yeah.
Rachel to Emma  Oh Emma. This is going to be your first Thanksgiving. What
  are you thankful for? Mommy's bobbies.
Ross  A lot of people are thankful for those.
< knock on door>
Woman at door  Hello? Rachel?
Rachel  Who is it?
Woman at door  It's your favorite sister.
Ross and Rachel while looking at each other surprised and shocked  Jill?
Woman at door in a sing song voice  Amy.
Rachel  Hide my rings.
Rachel  Oh. <opens door preparing herself and then happily
  says> 
  Amy! Happy Thanksgiving.
Amy  Do you have a hair straightener?
Rachel  Um... hi.
Amy  oh... hi.. <goes to Rachel with open arms>
Rachel  Aw.
Amy  Hair Straightener?
Rachel  I haven't seen you in like.. a year.
Amy  Oh, I know, I know. I've just been crazed.
Rachel  Oh well yeah me too. Um.. I had a baby.
Amy  I decorated Dad's office.
Rachel  Oh.. yeah? Well unless you pushed a desk out of your
  vagina, <shakes head no> not the same thing.
Amy  Listen, um about the hair straightener, honey.. I really
  need one. I'm going to have dinner at my boyfriend's house.
Amy  Oh my God!
Rachel  mh hmm..
Amy  Is this Emmett? <pointing to EMMA>
Rachel  Uh.... its Emma.
Amy  Its a girl?
Ross  Hey Amy.
Rachel  Oh Amy, you remember Ross.
Amy  Not really. But you are much cuter then that geeky guy
  she used to date.
Ross  That was me.
Amy  No, he was this creepy guy from high school who had
  this huge crush on her since like the ninth grade.
Ross with a look of wondering how long this is going to go on on his face 
  Still me.
Amy  No, I'm not talking about you. <to Rachel> It
  was your fat 
  friends brother with that bad afro, do you remember?
Ross starts talking over her 'do you remember' line  Amy. I'm going to save
  you some time, ok. <spins finger around in circle> All me.
Monica  Careful. <hands Chandler a china plate> Careful.
  CAREFUL!
Chandler  I'll tell you what, for the rest of our lives,
  I'll be careful until told otherwise. <looks at china> hey wait a minute
  this isn't the china we picked out..
Monica  I know, after you left the store, I chose different
  ones.
Chandler  Why?
Monica  well no offense honey, but your taste is a little
  feminine for me.
Chandler  Oh suddenly, flowers are feminine?
< Phoebe comes in>
Phoebe  Hey, everybody. Happy Thanksgiving!
Joey  Hey happy Thanksgiving.. Pheebs! <motions her to
  come over>
Phoebe  Hey, what's going on Joe?
Joey  I.. I.. I need a good lie.
Phoebe  Oh okay. How about the whole "man walking on
  the moon" thing. You know? You. you could. You could see the strings people!
Joey  No, no, no I need a good lie to explain why I wasn't
  at a work thing today.
Phoebe  Ooh, honey. You stink at lying.
Joey  I do not.
Phoebe  Oh really. Okay. let me ask you something. Yesterday
  at the coffee house, I went to the bathroom and when I came back, my muffin
  was gone-who took it?
Joey  Somebody opened the door to the coffee house and a
  raccoon came running in, went straight for your muffin and I said "Hey
  don't eat that-that's Phoebe's" and he said.. <pause> He said.. "Joey
  you stink at lying." What am I going to do?
Phoebe  Don't worry, don't worry. We'll come up with a good
  lie. I'll help you practice it.
Joey  Oh great, that'd be great. Thank you.
Phoebe  Sure, what.. what was the work thing?
Joey  Uh.. <forgetting what the work thing was, rolls
  up his sleeve on his right arm and shows Phoebe, she looks>
Phoebe  "Pick up grandma at the airport"?
Joey  Oh.. man..
Amy with straight hair  Oh she's precious. Do you ever worry she's going to
  get your real nose?
Rachel  Amy! <pause> Yes I do.. I really do. <grabs
  Ross' hand for support>
Amy  Hello? Yeah, um. Hang on one sec. <to Ross and Rachel> Can
  I take this upstairs?
Ross  Sure, we don't live there but...
Amy  Seriously? Its.. its just these rooms? <moves hands
  around motioning 'just these rooms'> <To Ross> I thought you were
  a doctor.
Rachel  Yeah, no. Ross has a PhD.
Amy  Ew. <walks into Rachel's room, I'm guessing>
Rachel  God she is unbelievable.
Ross  I know, I mean a PhD is just as good as an MD.
Rachel  Oh sure Ross, yeah. If I have a heart attack in a
  restaurant, I want you there with your fossil brush.
Amy storms out  Stupid Thanksgiving.
Rachel  What? What happened?
Amy  My boyfriend canceled on me. I mean.. I I finally find
  a real relationship. I mean, someone that I can spend this day with and then
  his wife comes back into town. I swear, its almost not worth dating married
  guys.
Ross  Don't say that.
Amy  Oh. I was so looking forward to this. It was going to
  be such a beautiful Thanksgiving. We were going to have sushi.
Rachel  Oh Amy, don't cry Amy.  Um.. Ross, could I talk
  to you in private?
Ross  Sure, you want to go upstairs?
Rachel  Um look I was thinking.. If its ok with Monica I
  would like to invite Amy to Thanksgiving.
Ross  You know, I think thats a great idea. It'll be like
  the pilgrims bringing the Indians syphilis.
Rachel  Look I know she's a little tough to take. She has
  no where else to go, and she's my sister. Alright, she's Emma's aunt. And I
  would like them to bond.
Ross  Ok, fine, but I don't want them bonding to much. I
  don't want her telling Emma she needs a nose job.
Rachel  Ross, you know what? She may need one..We're just
  going to have to make our peace with that!
Rachel opens their door  Hi.
Everyone there says  Hi, hey.
Rachel  Hey you guys, this is my sister Amy.  This is
  Chandler, Joey, Phoebe and you know Mon.
Everyone  Hi.
Amy  Oh my god. You're on Days of Our Lives.
Joey laughs  Yeah.
Amy  wow. They must put a lot of makeup on you.
Joey looks rejected  Hap.. Hap.. Happy Thanksgiving.
Ross to Monica  Hi.
Monica to Ross  Hi.
Monica to Emma  Hey you.
Monica to Amy  So. Welcome. Is this your first time you're
  seeing Emma?
Amy with confused look on face  Yeah I.. I think so. <sticks her hand out
  to shake hands with Phoebe and says to her> It's nice to meet you Emma.
Phoebe shakes her hand and says  Phoe-Be.
Amy  Oh. That's a funny noise.
Joey  Pheebs, I still need some help here
Phoebe  Oh right, ok um. Ok so its not just the lie you tell.
  but its the way you tell it. . For example if you look down at the ground when
  you're talking, people know you're lying.
Joey  Oh.. I don't know why this is so hard for me. you know..
  I mean lying is basically just acting and I am a terrfic actor.
Phoebe looks down  You are a terrific actor.
Amy coming out of the bathroom  Hey. Hey where's the baby?
Rachel  Oh we just put her down for a nap.
Amy  Oh I was just thinking. You know what would be incredible?
  If you guys died.
Ross first has a look of 'huh' then changes it to sarcastic happy  Thank you
  Amy.
Amy  no, no, then I would get the baby. I mean you know it
  would be just like a movie. Like at first I wouldn't know what to do with her,
  then I would rise to the occasion and and then I would get a makeover and then
  I'd get married.
Phoebe  Thats a great movie. <she claps>
Ross  Emma.
Amy turns around to Phoebe  Emma, Ross wants you.
Phoebe  PHOE-BE.
Amy turns to Ross and Rachel  Why does she keep making that
  noise?
Rachel  Honey, I don't know how to tell you this, but um,
  if something were to happen to Ross or to myself <Ross and Rachel knock
  on wood> um you wouldn't get the baby.
Amy  Well who would?
Ross  Well we haven't offically asked them yet, but we would
  want Monica and Chandler.
Chandler  I can't believe you'd want us to raise Emma.
Monica  yeah oh my god, I'm so moved.
Amy  I don't believe this, hold on a second. You guys die
  and I don't get your baby?
Rachel  See look Amy, we're a lot closer to Monica and Chandler.
  We see them every day. And truthfully honey, you don't seem very connected
  to the baby.
Amy  Connected? I mean.. to what? She's.. she's  a lump.
Chandler  You know, guys I got to say. This means so much
  to me. That you would trust me with your child. I mean, we all know that Monica
  and I have been trying to have a baby of our own. You know I've had my doubts
  about my skills as a father, but that you two.. that you two.... <starts
  to cry>
Amy  <points to Chandler> This guy? Seriously?
Monica  Okay! It's time for dinner. Everyone we're using
  our fancy china.. um and its very expensive so please be careful.
Ross starts playing with a plate  Woah. Woah... <nearly really drops the
  plate and more seriously> Woah.
Monica  Okay, just to be clear comedy with the plates will
  not be well recieved. <pinches Ross' arm>
Joey  Hey! How come my plate's less fancy then everyone else's?
  Do you not trust me with a fancy plate?
Monica  No, honey, its. thats a special plate.  See
  its a game, whoever gets that plate wins.
Joey  I can't believe I won.
Amy  Its such a slap in the face. I'm your sister and you
  would give your baby to these strangers over me.
Rachel  Monica is Ross' sister.
Amy  No, Ross' sister was really fat.
Monica  That was me.
Amy  No, she was this really dorky girl in high school that
  used to follow Rachel around like a puppy dog.
Rachel  Hey. Amy. You've got to stop doing that.
Monica about to have a heart attack  Okay, listen I know you're having a little
  bit of a family crisis, but you don't have to take it out on the plates. I
  mean, I mean in fact I think that everyone should cut their food like this.
Monica  Now see, this way you protect the plate.. and lets
  face it you have fun.
Amy  Okay, how about this, you guys die and the crazy plate
  lady dies, then do I get the baby?
Chandler  No, if crazy plate lad.. <sees Monica frustrated
  at this comment> If Monica dies then I would get Emma, Right?
Rachel  Well actually...
Chandler  Actually what?
Ross  well.. its just. its just in that case, then um. Emma
  would go to my parents.
Chandler  What?
Amy  Hurts, doesn't it?
Joey raises his hand  Uh.. who has to die for me to get her?
Chandler  So if Monica's not around, then I'm not good enough
  to raise Emma?
Ross looks down  No,  that that is not what we're saying.
Joey  Yeah he's lying. He looked down.
Chandler  Well what is wrong with me? Am I .. am I incomptent?
  Because I managed to survive whatever it is that killed the three of you!
Rachel  Honey, you're taking this the wrong way. We think
  you're going to be a wonderful parent. It's just.. you're more the fun parent.
Ross  Yeah and we'd want to make sure Emma has someone like
  Monica who is more uh. uh discliplinarin.. someone who can be firm and strict.
Monica  Thats not how you see me, is it?
Phoebe while cutting a sweet potatoe in the air  No you're all about the fun.
Chandler  Look, I may not know a lot about babies, but do
  you really think I'm not capable?
Ross  No, you both are equally capable. Its just.. you're
  strongest when.. when you're together.
Chandler  Ok. So if we both had Emma and I die <knocks
  on table>  she'd have to give her up.
Ross  Sure, Monica would have to give her up.
Joey  I lie better then that, right?
Chandler  So.. let me get this straight. So my two friends
  die, I get Emma. Then my wife dies, then Emma the one tiny ray of hope left
  in my life gets taken away from me?
Phoebe  There's your movie! <claps>
Monica  Hey. There you are. You disappeared after dinner.
Chandler  Oh? Did somebody miss me? Is there a child to raise
  poorly?
Monica  Ross and Rachel don't know what they're talking about.
  I mean its not like their so responsible. Emma is a product of a bottle of
  Merlot and a five year old condom.
Chandler  Yeah but they're right. I mean, I'm not a strong
  father figure and I never will be.
Monica  No you learn these things. You grow into it.
Chandler  Yeah, but its not who I am. Everything they said
  was exaclty why I was worried about having a kid. And its true. And look everybody
  knows it.
Monica  I don't know it! I want to have a kid with you because
  I think you're going to be an amazing dad... at the fun parts and the hard
  parts.
Chandler  Oh yeah, well can you picture me saying "Go
  to your room! You're grounded"?
Monica  Can you hear me say "You're grounded"?
Chandler  You said that to me last week.
Monica  How hard is it? No shoes on the furniture.
Joey groans and gets off the phone  The producer from Days left a message
  on my machine asking why I wasn't at the parade. They said everybody's pissed
  off at me.. <whiny voice> And they all got to meet Santa!
Phoebe  It's ok. I thought of the perfect lie for you. It's
  easy to remember and doesn't invite a lot of questions. You weren't at the
  parade because you had a family emergency.
Joey  Oh, I like that, yeah. Wasn't at the parade because
  I had a family emergency.
Phoebe  Ooh, what happened?
Joey all nervous and looking down and fiddling with his ear  Oh.. My sister's
  raccoon.
Phoebe  No! Nothing with a raccoon.
Joey  Arg... Alright, I'll take care of it. <throws hands
  out in the air>
Monica  Oh wait.. What are you doing?
Joey  Setting the table.
Phoebe  Yeah we thought it would be nice to use the fancy
  china for dessert too.
Monica  Oh how nice. Maybe later we can all go blow our noses
  on my wedding dress.
Ross  Hey dude, you okay? Sorry about before.
Chandler  Oh no thats okay, you're totally right. I don't
  know anything about disciplining a child. But it did hurt my feelings and I
  want you to know that when I die, you don't get Joey.
Amy walks over to the couch and sits down next to Rachel  Ucch.  <pauses> Uchh <louder
  this time> In case you hadn't noticed, I'm not talking to you.
Rachel  UCHH! <much louder and longer then Amy's>
Amy  You know.. this.. this is classic Rachel.
Rachel  Yeah.. yeah right.. Remember in high school when
  I died and didn't give you my baby?
Amy  This might be my one chance to have a baby Rachel. I
  mean, you know that I have been so busy focusing on my carrer.
Rachel  What? What carrer?
Amy  Um.. I'm a decorator.
Rachel  Ok. You decorate dad's office and so now you're a
  decorator. Okay! I went to the zoo yesterday and now I'm a koala bear.
Amy  Why can't you ever be supportive?
Rachel  Sup.. You want to talk supportive? You didn't even
  come and visit me when I was in the hospital having the baby.
Amy  Oh. Yeah. Well.. You didn't come see me when I was in
  the hospital when I was getting my lips done.
Rachel  I did the first time! Oh. Oh.. <gets up and walks
  into the kitchen> And you know what. You want to know why I'm not giving
  Emily to you.
Ross  Emma.
Rachel turns to Ross  Oh whose side are you on? <back
  to Amy> I'm not giving you Emma because there is no way you could handle
  the responibility of a child.
Amy  How hard could it be? You do it.
Joey  ooh oooh..
Amy  Do you want to know why you don't want  me to have
  the baby?
Rachel  uh huh.
Amy  Because you don't want me to be happy. You.. you have
  always been jealous of me.
Rachel  Jealous of what? Of your lack of responsiblity? You,
  your immaturity? Your total disregard of other people's feelings?
Amy  Uh.. To name a few.  You know.. You know.. You've
  just always been like this. You just have to have everything. And I couldn't
  have anything. Like in junior high, when you stole Timmy from me. I mean, do
  you even realize how much that hurt me?
Rachel  Timmy was my boyfriend and you made out with him!
Amy  Oh come on, that was 20 years ago. Get over it.
Rachel  I cannot, I cannot believe that I invited you here
  today.
Amy  Yeah, well you know what I cannot believe. That my so-called
  sister, gets a 30% discount from Ralph Lauren and I still have to pay retail.
Rachel  ah ha ha. ah ha ha. <evil meancing laughter> It's
  forty five.
Amy  You bitch. You just think you're so perfect. With your
  new baby and your, your small apartment. <directs this to Ross who in turns
  throws the towel in his hand down on the table> Well let me tell you something.
  Your baby isn't even that cute.
Ross walks over  Too far, Amy. Too far.
Rachel  You take that back.
Amy  No.
Rachel  Take it back!
Amy  No! What are you going to do? Make me?
Rachel  Heey man, I work out.
Amy  So do I.
Rachel  I do pilates.
Amy  I do yoga.
Rachel  Bring it on!
Monica  Put the plates in the boxes!! Put the plates in the
  boxes!
Rachel  Did you just push me?
Amy  Uh, yeah I think I did.
Rachel  Alright. Thats it! <Pushes Amy back>
Monica screaming at Ross  Forget the bubblewrap! There isn't
  time!
Rachel starts messing up Amy's hair  Frizzy frizzy frizzy frizzy!!
Phoebe  Oh my god! Shouldn't we stop this?
Joey  What? Are you out of your mind? Lets throw some jello
  on them.
Rachel  Ew! Gross.
Chandler  Alright! That is it. This is our apartment and
  you can not behave this way. Now if you can't act your age then you shouldn't
  be here at all. Now those plates may not be as nice as the pretty pink ones
  I picked out, but they're very important to Monica. I want you to apologize
  to her right now.
Amy  I'm sorry.
Rachel  Mon, I'm so sorry.
Chandler  Okay. Thats better. Now I want you to both apologize
  to each other and mean it.
Amy and Rachel at same time  Sorry.
Chandler  By the way, that fight was totally arousing.
Ross  Dude. Well done. You know what? If I die, and Rachel
  dies and Monica dies then you can totally take care of Emma.
Chandler  Oh yeah? Well thanks.
Ross  So, so now do I get Joey?
Chandler  Okay, but you should know he eats five times a
  day and shoves pennies up his nose.
Rachel  Are you okay Mon?
Monica  uh huh.. I mean these things happen. Its' just a
  plate. Its not like somebody died.
Phoebe  It's all right. You can mourn.
Monica starts crying  Thank you. It was so beautiful. <gets up and walks
  towards the front door> I'm going to go to Joeys and get the pies.
Joey  Actually its not pies, its just pie.
Monica  I don't care. <pauses and realizes...> Oh my
  god. I've lost the will to scold.
Rachel  Look Amy, it got a little of control..Um.. and I'm
  sorry. You're my sister and uh.. if it really means that much to you..
Amy  So you're going to give me the baby?
Rachel  Uh. No.. I was going to let you use my Ralph Lauren
  discount.
Amy starting to cry  You are not going to regret this.
Rachel  She needs changing.
Chandler  Oh no no no.. I'll get her. I'm super-compentent
  and totally responsibile and fourth in line to raise Emma. I'll be right there
  Emma. Just let me get my trusty diaper bag here. <knocks over the box of
  china> Well.. what do you know? I guess, I'll be the one who dies first.
[Scene  Chandler is packing the broken china in its box. He's taping up the
  top of box so thoroughly, there isn't an inch of cardboard which isn't covered
  in tape. He is struggling with the tape dispenser.]
Phoebe  Hey, does Monica know about her broken plates yet?
Chandler  Nope...
Phoebe  Broke them all, huh?
Chandler  Yep...
Phoebe  You gonna tell her?
Chandler  Nope... (Monica walks in) Hey... so I'm gonna...
  put the plates back. You know, I think you were right, I don't think we should
  use these plates again for a looong time.
Monica  Like only if the queen comes?
Chandler  Maybe not even then. (Joey walks in)
Joey  Hey! I did it. I called my producer. I told him I had
  a family emergency, he totally bought it. Thanks for teaching me how to lie
  Pheebs.
Monica  Bye plates!
Joey  Oh, you told her you broke all the plates, huh? (Chandler
  walks back, looking angrily at Joey)
Monica  What? Something happened with the plates?
Joey  Uhm... (looks down) Yeah... this uhm... raccoon came
  in...

[Scene  Chandler's office in Tulsa.   His assistant is showing him photographs.]
JO LYNN  This kitty is Mittens and this one is Fitzhugh, and this little guy 
  in the cat condo is Jinkies.
CHANDLER  Yep.  That's a lot of cats Jo Lynn.  Single are ya?
CHANDLER  Chandler Bing.
JOEY  Hey.  How come you're answering your own phone?  Where's your crazy assistant?
CHANDLER  What's up Joe?
JOEY  Okay, what have we always wanted to do together?
CHANDLER  Braid each other's hair and ride horseback on the beach?
JOEY  No, no, no.  When you get home tomorrow night, you and I are going to 
  be at the Wizzards-Knicks game . . .  courtside!
CHANDLER  Courtside?  Oh my God.
JOEY  Yeah.  Maybe Michael Jordon will dive for the ball and break my jaw with 
  his knee.
CHANDLER  That's so cool.  I'll let Monica know.
MONICA  Hello?
CHANDLER  Joey just called.  He's got courtside Knicks tickets for him and 
  me tomorrow night.
MONICA  Really?  But tomorrow night is the only night I get off from the restaurant.  
  If you go to the game, we won't have a night together for another week.
CHANDLER  But hey, it's courtside.  The cheerleaders are going to be right 
  in fr. . . (Pause)  That's not the way to convince you.
MONICA  Chandler look, I don't want to be one of those wives who says, "You 
  can't go to the game.  You have to spend time with me."  So, if you could just 
  realize it on your own . . .
CHANDLER  I know.  You're right.  I want to see you too.  I've just got to 
  figure out a way to tell Joey, you know?  He's really looking forward to this.
MONICA  Tell him that you haven't seen your wife in a long time.  Tell him 
  that having a long-distance relationship is really difficult.  Tell him that 
  what little time we have is precious.
CHANDLER  Yeah, ah, ah . . .  I'll think of something.
[Scene  Ross and Rachel's apartment.  Ross is in the living room covering Emma.  
  Rachel enters wearing a sexy dress.]
ROSS  Wow!  (pause)  Wow, You look . . . uh . . .   It's just, ah . . .   That 
  dress . . . uh . . . 
RACHEL  Well, I hope the ends of these sentences are good.
ROSS  Well, well, they're good.  It's been a while since I've seen you like 
  this.  You, you clean up good.
RACHEL  Oh well, well thank you.  (She laughs.  He stares for a moment.)  Okay, 
  stop.  Stop looking at me like that.  The last time that happened, (points 
  to Ross) that happened.  (points to Emma.)
ROSS  Oh right, right.  (They pause and exchange a glance. Then, Ross looks 
  away.)  So, are you . . . ah . . . you excited about your, your first night 
  away from Emma?
RACHEL  Yeah, yeah.  Phoebe and I are going to have so much fun.  And thank 
  you for watching the baby, by the way.
ROSS  Oh, it's fine.  Actually, I, I invited Mike over.
RACHEL  Phoebe's Mike?
ROSS  Yeah.
RACHEL  I didn't know you guys hung out.
ROSS  We don't.  But I thought it would be nice to get to know him.  You know, 
  maybe have a little dinner, drinks, conversation.
ROSS  I don't know.  But, you know, we, we have a lot in common, you know.  
  He plays piano; I played keyboards in college.  He's been divorced; I have some 
  experience in that area.
RACHEL  Yeah.
PHOEBE  Hi
RACHEL  Hey.
PHOEBE  (spotting Rachel's dress) Oooh.  Girl's night out indeed.
RACHEL  (to Ross) Ok.  So now, I think Emma is probably down for the night, 
  but if you need anything Ross . . .
ROSS  Rach, Rach, we'll be fine, all right?  You go have fun.
RACHEL  Okay.  You too.  And I hope you score.  (to Mike) Bye.
MIKE  Bye.
ROSS  So . . .  Welcome.
MIKE  (Holds up a six pack of Foster's Lager) I got beer.
ROSS  I got bottled breast milk.
MIKE  Eh, why don't we start with the beer?
ROSS  Okay.  (They sit.)  So, um, Phoebe tells me you, ah, you play piano.
MIKE  Yeah.
ROSS  You know, I, I used to, ah, play keyboards in college.
MIKE  Ah?  (pause)  Do you have one here?
ROSS  No.
MIKE  Okay.  (pause)
ROSS  Um . . . ah . . . you know, I'm divorced.  Um, Phoebe, ah . . . Phoebe 
  said you . . . You've been divorced?
MIKE  Yeah.  (pause)  Yeah, I'm sorry.  I don't . . . I don't really like to 
  talk about it.
ROSS  (pause) That's okay.  We'll talk about (pause) something else.  (They 
  pause.  They drink.)
MIKE   So, you're a paleontologist, right?
ROSS  Yeah.
MIKE  My cousin's a paleontologist.
ROSS  Ah?  (Mike nods.  Another pause.)  Well, he and I would probably have 
  a lot to talk about.
[Scene   Monica and Chandler's apartment.  Monica is wearing a sexy negligee.  
  She pours two glasses of wine as Chandler enters with a carry-on suitcase.  
  He sets the case by the door.)
MONICA  Hi.
CHANDLER  Hey.
MONICA  Welcome home.
CHANDLER  (Hangs his jacket over the suitcase, locks the door, then turns to 
  Monica.)  Oh well, look at you.
MONICA  Yeah.  What do you think?
CHANDLER  Well, it looks great.  It's just that . . . well, I'm wearing the 
  same thing underneath.  So . . .
MONICA  Oh.
CHANDLER  See what I mean . . . (They kiss.)
JOEY  Hey!  How come the door's locked?
MONICA  Just a second.
CHANDLER  (hushed) No, no, no, no, no.  Joey can't know that I'm here.
MONICA  Why not?
CHANDLER  Because I didn't know how to tell him that I couldn't go to the Knicks 
  game.  So, I just told him that I had to stay in Tulsa.
MONICA  So, you lied to him?
CHANDLER  Achhh.  It's always better to lie than to have the complicated discussion.  
  (pause)  Except with you.
JOEY  Hey!  Open the door.  What's going on?  (He knocks.)
JOEY  What are you . ..  (He sees her in her negligee.)  Why are you dressed 
  like that?
MONICA  Oh, because, um . . .  well, Chandler's going to be home in a couple 
  of days.  So, I thought I would, you know, practice the art of seduction.
JOEY  Oh, I thought I heard a man's voice before.
MONICA  Oh I was just doing Chandler's side of the conversation.  You know, 
  like, "Hi, How do I look?"  (As Chandler) "Really sexy.  Could I BE any more 
  turned on?"
JOEY  Okay.  (pause.  He looks over her shoulder at the table with the wine.)  
  Whoa, whoa.  Why are there two glasses of wine out?
MONICA  Because. . .  one of them is for you.
MONICA  Cheers.  (She clinks his glass and pulls back.)  Okay, buh-bye.  (She 
  closes the door.)
CHANDLER  You know, it's funny.  I've been, ah, practicing the art of seduction 
  myself.  (He raises his hands in front of himself, sticks out his behind, and 
  wiggles it.)  Hi ya.
MONICA  You might want to keep practicing.
CHANDLER  Yah.
CHANDLER  It's Joey.  (He answers it, holding it out so that Monica can hear 
  too.)  Hey Joe.
JOEY  Dude, come home!
CHANDLER  What? Why?
JOEY  COME . . .  HOME.
CHANDLER  Look I, I can't.  What's going on?
JOEY  I don't know how to tell you this but, uh . . . I think Monica's cheatin' 
  on ya.  I told you shouldn't have married someone so much hotter than you.
JOEY  All right look.  (He walks to the hallway.)  If you can't come home and 
  deal with this, then I'm gonna.
CHANDLER  NO!
JOEY  (outside the apartment door) I just heard him!
CHANDLER  (softly) Can you . . . hear him . . . now?
JOEY  (listens at the door.)  No.  (pause) All right, I'm going in.
CHANDLER  No! Wait!
JOEY  I heard him again!
CHANDLER  (writhes as if in agony) All right, look.  Just stay there.  I'm 
  coming home.
JOEY  Okay.  Great.  I'll see you when you get here.  I'm gonna wait out in 
  the hall in case the dude comes out.
CHANDLER  Is that really necessary?
JOEY  Absolutely.  You'd do it for me.  Not that you ever have to because I 
  know how to keep my women satisfied.
[Scene  Ross and Rachel's apartment.  Mike is blowing a note from his beer 
  bottle.  Ross stares off to the side.)
ROSS  Shouldn't the pizza be here by now?  I mean, they said thirty minutes 
  or less.  Well, how long has it been?
MIKE  (looking at his watch) Eleven minutes.  (long pause)  And now twelve.  
  So, do you like the beer?
ROSS  I do.  I do.  Although, it's actually a lager.
MIKE  huh.  (pause)  What's the difference between beer and lager?
ROSS  I don't know.  We could look it up.
MIKE  (nods) Things are about to get wild.
[Scene  A bar.  Rachel and Phoebe are bringing their drinks from the bar to 
  a sofa.]
PHOEBE  Oh God.  Remember the girls' nights we used to have sitting around 
  talking about you and Ross?
RACHEL  Oh God.  It seems like forever ago.
PHOEBE  I know.  (sighs)   So, what's going on with you and Ross?
RACHEL  Well, um . . . I don't know.  I mean, for a long time nothing.  But 
  you know, actually right before you picked me up, Ross and I had a . . . ah 
  . . . little thing.
PHOEBE  Oh my God!  I love things.  What happened?
RACHEL  Well, um, first he told me he liked how I looked.  And, ah, then we 
  had a little . . . um . . . eye-contact.
PHOEBE  Eye-contact?
RACHEL  Mm-hmm.
PHOEBE  I hope you were using protection.
WAITER  (with tray and two drinks)  Excuse me.  Um, these are from the two 
  gentlemen at the end of the bar.
RACHEL  Oh.  (to Phoebe) Should we send them something back?
PHOEBE  Oooh.  Let's do.  Let's send them mashed potatoes.
RACHEL  No!  Wait!  No, no.  Don't do that!  That's going to make them think 
  they can come over here.
PHOEBE  So?  What if they do?
RACHEL  Well, we're not here to meet guys.  You have a boyfriend, I have a 
  b. . . baby and a Ross.
PHOEBE  Yeah, but, ah, ah, nothing has to happen.  We're just having fun.  
  You know, not everything had to go as far as "eye-contact."
[Scene  Monica and Chandler's apartment.  Chandler is seated in the chair and 
  Monica stands behind the sofa.]
MONICA  Chandler, you have to tell Joey that you're not in Tulsa.
CHANDLER  Don't you think it's better for him to think that you're cheating 
  on me, than for him to think that I'm cheating on him?  (Monica tips her head 
  slightly as if asking "Did you hear yourself?")  I heard it.
MONICA  I don't want him to think that I'm having an affair.
CHANDLER  All right.  I've got a plan.  I'll go down the fire escape.
MONICA  Yes, because all good plans start with, "I'll go down the fire escape."
CHANDLER  Hear me out woman.  I'll go down the fire escape.  Then, I'll wait 
  for a while.  Then, when I come up the stairs, it'll be just like I just got 
  back from Tulsa.  Then, Joey and I will come in and see that there's no guy 
  in here.
MONICA  Aren't you afraid that Joey's going to figure all of this out?  (pause)  
  I heard it.
CHANDLER  I'm just going to wait for a little while.
MONICA  Scary pigeon's back?
CHANDLER  It's huge.
[Scene  Ross and Rachel's apartment.  Three pizza crusts, two bottle caps and 
  the plastic tripod are left in the otherwise empty pizza box.  Mike is making 
  hollow popping noises with his mouth.  He begins to speak, but stops and pops 
  his lips a few more times and takes a drink.  Ross smiles as if he has thought 
  of something to say, but then he stops and sinks back in a slump on the sofa.]
[Scene  The bar.  Two men are chatting with Rachel and Phoebe.]
RACHEL  Oh my God.  I can't believe you live in that building.  My grandmother 
  lives in that building.  Ida Green?  No sense of personal space?  Kind of smells 
  like chicken?  Looks like a potato.
BILL  "Spuds" is your grandmother?
RACHEL  That's my bubby!
KEVIN  So, we're on our way to a couple of parties.  Um. . . maybe we can get 
  your numbers and give you guys a call if we find something fun.
PHOEBE  Yeah. . . I'm sorry.  We weren't really looking for anything to happen 
  with you guys.  I, I have a boyfriend.
RACHEL  I don't know.  He was cute, and he liked me.  It was an impulse.
PHOEBE  What about Ross?  What about your moment?  Don't you want to talk to 
  Ross about it?
RACHEL  No.  No, because I know exactly how the conversation's gonna go.  "Hey 
  Ross, you know, I think we had a moment before."
RACHEL  (lowers voice to imitate Ross) "Yeah."  (Clears throat.)  "Me too."
RACHEL  (as herself) "Well, but I'm not sure I really want to do anything about 
  it."
RACHEL  (as Ross) "Yeah."  (Clears throat twice.) "Me neither." (Clears throat 
  again.)
RACHEL  (as herself) "Well, should we just continue to live together and not 
  really tell each other how we're really feeling?"
RACHEL  (as Ross) "Yeah.  That works for me." (Clears throat twice more.)
PHOEBE  Yeah, I see what you mean.  By the way, nice Ross imitation.
RACHEL  Oh, thanks.
PHOEBE  But, your Rachel wasn't whiny enough.
RACHEL  (whining) Wha. . . hey!
PHOEBE  (pointing) Better!
RACHEL  Well, the point is, maybe I should just stop waiting around for moments 
  with Ross, you know?  I should just . . . move on with my life.
PHOEBE  Really?  You're moving on from Ross?
RACHEL  I don't know.  Do I have to decide right now?
PHOEBE  Well, you kind of just did.  That guy is going to call you tonight.  
  Ross is going to pick up the phone and that's a pretty clear message.
RACHEL  Oh God, Ross.  Ross is going to pick up the phone.  Oh, I have to get 
  my number back.  (She turns to find Bill, but they have gone.)  Oh my God.  
  He's gone.
PHOEBE  (imitating Rachel) "Oh, I have to get my number back.  Oh my God.  
  He's gone."  (smiles) Dead on.
[Scene  Ross and Rachel's apartment.  Ross and Mike are sitting on the sofa.  
  Ross is fidgeting with the cuff of his sweater while Mike blows his cheeks out.  
  Ross blows a piece of fuzz from his finger.)
MIKE  (releases a whoosh of air) Ya know, I'm going to take off.
ROSS  So soon?
MIKE  Well, yeah.
ROSS  Okay.  Well, thanks, ah, thanks for the beer.
MIKE  Ah, you mean lager.
ROSS  Ah yeah.  Good times.
MIKE  (In the hall, relieved) Oh.
MIKE  Hello?
PHOEBE  (calling from the bar on her cell phone.) Hey, Mike, it's me.  Listen, 
  is um, is Ross near you?
MIKE  Uh, no.  I just left.
PHOEBE  Well, you have to go back in.
MIKE  Wha . . .?  Go back?  To the "land where time stands still"?
PHOEBE  I'm so sorry honey, but, okay, Rachel gave this guy her number and, 
  um, she doesn't want Ross to answer the phone.  So, you have to intercept all 
  his calls.
MIKE  I can't do that!
PHOEBE  (to Rachel) He says he can't do that.
RACHEL  Oh give me , , ,  (Phoebe gives Rachel the phone.)  Hi, Mike?  Hi.  
  Listen.  I know this is a lot to ask, but you know what?  If you do this I . 
  . . Phoebe will . . . do anything you want.  Seriously, I'm talking dirty stuff.
PHOEBE  All right. (She takes the phone from Rachel.)  Hello?  Hi.  I'm sorry 
  about her, but she wasn't wrong about the dirty stuff.
MIKE  All right.  I'll do it.  (Phoebe gives the thumbs-up sign to Rachel.)  
  But really, how much dirtier can it get?
PHOEBE  (knowingly chuckles) Oh, Mike.  Bye.
MIKE  Hey buddy.
ROSS  Uh, hi.
MIKE  Um, can I come back in?
ROSS  (putting his arm up with his hand on the door frame.)  Why?  (He starts 
  to lower his arm.)
MIKE  (Entering the apartment) I, I was just thinking about how much more we 
  have to talk about.
ROSS  (whining) But you left.
[Scene  The hallway and stairs outside Chandler and Monica's apartment.  Chandler 
  enters from the stairs.  Joey is sitting with a baseball bat.]
JOEY  Wow!  That didn't take long.  I thought you said Tulsa was, like a three 
  hour flight.
CHANDLER  (pause) Well, you're forgetting about the time difference.
MONICA  (gasp) Chandler!  You're home!
CHANDLER  That's right.  You're husband's home.  So, now the sex can stop.
MONICA  What are you saying?
CHANDLER  Joey said that you're in here with another man.
MONICA  There's no man in here.  How dare you accuse me of that.  (She slaps 
  Chandler.)
JOEY  All right.  All right.  Then, maybe you won't mind if me and my friend 
  take a look around, huh?  (He checks the bathroom shaking the bat.  Then he 
  proceeds to their bedroom.)  Bwa-ah-ah!
CHANDLER  (To Monica) What is he doing?
MONICA  (smiling) I arranged some pillows on the bed to look like a guy.
JOEY  (emerging) Bedroom is clear, although you might need some new pillows.
CHANDLER  All right.  Well, I'll check the guest room.
JOEY  (sniffing the air and then Monica.)  Why do I smell men's cologne?
MONICA  (sniffing Joey) I think that's you.
JOEY  (sniffs his shirt.)  Oh yeah.  I rubbed a magazine on myself earlier.
CHANDLER  There's nobody here Joe.
JOEY  I guess not.
MONICA  I can't believe you thought I was cheating.  (pointing at Joey) You 
  own me an apology.
JOEY  Yeah, right Monica.  I'm so sorry.
MONICA  (suddenly starts issuing him out) Ah, it's an honest mistake.  It could 
  happen to anyone.  All right, see ya.
JOEY  (spots the suitcase just inside the door where Chandler left it) Whoa, 
  whoa.  Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  If you just got back from Tulsa, how 
  did your suitcase beat you here?
CHANDLER  (thinks, then turns to Monica) I climb down the fire escape and you 
  can't put that in the closet?
[Scene  Ross and Rachel's apartment.  Mike is reading from a book.]
MIKE  So, except for the fermentation process, beer and ale are basically the 
  same thing.  Fascinating isn't it.
ROSS  Maybe you should look up "fascinating."
MIKE  I'll get it.  (He lunges across Ross's lap on the sofa to reach the phone.  
  Ross stares at him with wide eyes.)  Hello?  Ross's place.  Mike speaking.  
  (pause.  Hands phone to Ross)  It's for you.
ROSS  (takes the phone, but speaks to Mike) I don't understand what just happened 
  here.
[Scene  Monica and Chandler's apartment " continuing action.]
JOEY  What's going on?
CHANDLER  I'm sorry.  I, I told you I was in Tulsa because I wanted to spend 
  the night with Monica and I, I didn't know . . .  I didn't think you'd understand.
JOEY  What? You think I'm too dumb to understand that a husband needs to be 
  with his wife?  Huh?  Do you think I'm like, "Duh."  (He strikes himself in 
  the head with the bat.  He stands dazed for a moment.)
MONICA  Joey?
JOEY  Yeah?  (His eyes bug out.)
MONICA  I don't know what to say.  We shouldn't have lied to you.
CHANDLER  Yeah.  I feel so bad.  Is there anything I can do to make it up to 
  you?
JOEY  (pause) Yeah, you could go to the game with me, ah, even though I know 
  you said you couldn't.  But then you lied to me and tricked me and gave me a 
  bump on the head.
CHANDLER  I'm sorry.  That's the one thing I can't do.  I promised I'd be with 
  Monica.
JOEY  All right.
MONICA  (taps chandler on the arm) You can go.
CHANDLER  What?
MONICA  You should go to the game.  It's okay.  I want you to.
CHANDLER  Really?  You're gonna be okay?
MONICA  Yeah, I'll be fine.  You know, maybe I'll stay here and practice the 
  art of seduction.
CHANDLER  You're gonna put on sweats and clean, aren't you?
MONICA  It's gonna be so hot!  (She kisses him.)
CHANDLER  Okay, bye.
MONICA  Have fun.
JOEY  Thanks.  (Joey and Chandler exit to the hall.  Joey pulls out the tickets 
  and hands one to Chandler.)  Here's your ticket.
CHANDLER  Hey, listen.  I'm never going to lie to you again, okay?  And I want 
  you to know that nobody thinks you're stupid.
JOEY  Thanks man.
JOEY  Where are you going?
CHANDLER  Game's tomorrow night Joe.
[Scene  Ross and Rachel's apartment.  Rachel and Phoebe enter.)
RACHEL  Hi.
ROSS  Oh God.  (He hugs Rachel)
RACHEL  Oh . . .
MIKE  I'm so glad you're back.  (He hugs Phoebe.)
PHOEBE  Oh.
RACHEL  Wow.  So, what did you guys do?
ROSS  Oh, you know . . . we just drank some beer and Mike played with the boundaries 
  of normal social conduct.
MIKE  It's true.  I did.
PHOEBE  (pause) Well, good bye.
RACHEL  That was fun Pheebs.
PHOEBE  I know.  That was fun.  (She and Mike exit.)
RACHEL  See you guys.  (She closes the door.)
ROSS  Rachel, lock the door.  Lock the door,  seriously.
RACHEL  Oh shoot.  I forgot to pay Phoebe for the drinks.  (She exits to the 
  hallway and closes the door behind her.)  Wait, wait.  Sorry.  Did he call?  
  Did that guy call?
MIKE  No.  Just his mom.
MIKE  Yeah.
MIKE  (nods) uh-huh.
RACHEL  Yeah.
ROSS  Hello.  (listens)  Ah, no, she's not here right now.  Can I take a message?  
  (grabs a pad and pen)  Bill from the bar?  (writes)  Okay, "Bill from the bar."  
  I'll make sure she gets your number.
RACHEL  Aaah.  (She goes to tend Emma.)
ROSS  So, ah . . . So, how was it?   Uh, did you guys. . . Did you guys have 
  a good time?
RACHEL  Oh, it was so much fun.  It felt so good to be out.
ROSS  (holds up the message) Uh, Rach.
RACHEL  (still looking at Emma) Yeah?
ROSS  (pauses, then crunches up the note and stuffs it in his pocket.)  Never 
  mind.
[Tag Scene  Central Perk.  Phoebe and Mike are on the sofa.  Ross enters.]
ROSS  Hey you guys.  (He sits.)
MIKE  Hey.
PHOEBE  Hey.  I'll be right back.  I've got to go to the bathroom.  (She rises 
  and exits.)
MIKE  (finally) Stout.  That's a kind of beer.
[Scene  Monica and Chandler's Apartment, everyone's there; Phoebe recites the last verse of a poem to Joey. This poem is known as "The Night Before Christmas" by Clement Clarke Moore, but it seems that it's rather "Account of a visit from St. Nicholas" by Henry Livingston.]
Phoebe  ...sprang to his sleigh, to his team gave a whistle;and away they all flew like the down of a thistle; but I heard him exclaim, ere he drove out of sight, "Merry Christmas to all, and to all a goodnight!"
Joey  (impressed) Wow, that was great! You really wrote that?
Phoebe  (smiling) Uh-huh.
Chandler  (coming from the bedroom) Say goodbye elves, I'm off to Tulsa.
Monica  I can't believe you're not gonna be here for Christmas.
Ross  You're really not coming back?
Chandler  Yeah, we have all this paperwork that needs to be filed by the end of the year. If I don't get it done, I'll be fired.
Monica  It's so unfair, you don't even like your job!
Chandler  So, who does?
Phoebe  Oh, I like my job.
Joey  I *love* my job.
Rachel  Yeah, I can't *wait* to go back to work.
Ross  I can't get *enough* dinosaurs!
Chandler  I'm sorry, I won't be here.
Monica  It's just... It's hard enough not seeing you during the week, but for Christmas... alright, if this is what you have to do, I understand.
Chandler  Thanks. (they kiss) I'll see you New Year's Day.
Monica  (shocked) You're not gonna be here New Year's Eve??
Chandler  Did I not mention that?
Monica  No!
[Scene  Chandler's Office in Tulsa, in the conference room. Chandler's staff/co-workers are sitting round the table; Chandler is walking around, when he notices a piece of paper attached to the back of his chair.]
Chandler  All right everybody, I know that it's Christmas Eve and you'd rather be with your families, but there's *no* call (he takes it off) for writing "Screw you, Mr. Bing!" on the back of my chair! (he looks at it) -- By the way, you can all call me Chandler.
Wendy  Hey!
Others  Hey.
Chandler  Hey. Where've you been?
Wendy  I was, uh, checking out that insurance company's Christmas party on three, oh, it was really beautiful, they have all these decorations and this huge tree and I just, uh... to hell with them, we have to work. -- So I stole ther ham. (She turns the cardboard box upside down over the conference table, a big piece of ham falls out.)
Chandler  (to the others) You hear that? You may not be with your families, but at least it's gonna smell like ham in here.
Claudia  My kid's in a play right now.
Chandler  Y'know what, I know what will cheer you guys up! (he starts spreading envelopes among them) I had a little talk with the boys in New York, told 'em about all the hard work you've been doing and that a little Christmas bonus may be in order.
Ken  (reading off his card) "A donation has been made in your name to the New York City Ballet".
Chandler  Well, that's like money in your pocket! - Alright look, you want me to say it? This sucks. Being here sucks! This work sucks!
Wendy  *Now* it feels like Christmas.
Chandler  I'm sorry. Hey, at least you guys get to go home and be with your families tonight. I have to go back to an empty hotel room and lay down on a very questionable bedspread. And then tomorrow morning, you get to have Christmas morning in your own houses, wich, by the way, none of you have invited me to.
Ken  You can come to my house!
Chandler  Haha, no thanks!
Wendy  That was a nice pep-talk.
Chandler  Oh, thanks! I'm... actually thinking about becoming a motivational speaker.
Wendy  So, if you were home right now, what would you be doing?
Chandler  Typical Christmas-y stuff, you know? Our holidays are pretty traditional...
[Flashback to 410 - TOW The Girl From Poughkeepsie]
[Scene  Central Perk, Phoebe is singing her holiday song.]
[Flashback to 610 - TOW The Routine]
[Scene  Monica and Chandler's apartment, Chandler is there. Phoebe and Rachel enter.]
Rachel  Okay, Pheebs, you look in the kitchen, I will look in the back closet.
Chandler  I can save you time ladies, I'm right here.
Phoebe  Yeah, Chandler why don't you take a walk? This doesn't concern you.
Rachel  We are looking for our Christmas presents from Monica.
Chandler  What? That's terrible!
Phoebe  No-no, we do it every year!
Chandler  Oh well, that, that makes it not terrible.
Phoebe  No, yeah, we never find them! She's always best at us, that wily... minx.
Rachel  Don't worry, we're just gonna search here for an hour, and then we're gonna go over to Joey's and search, OK?
Chandler  No not okay, you can't look for Monica's presents!
Phoebe  Oh no, we have to!
Chandler  No, you don't have to, and you can't because I, I live here too.
Phoebe  Well then, you should look with us.
Chandler  Why?
Rachel  Chandler, aren't you worried about what to get Monica for Christmas?
Chandler  No, I have a great idea for a present for her.
Phoebe  Oh, that's it? (Mimics Chandler) A great idea! Oh yeah.
Rachel  Chandler, that's not enough. I mean what if she gets you a great present, two medium presents, and a bunch of little presents? And you've just gotten her one great present? I mean that's just gonna make her feel bad. Why would you do that to her Chandler? Why? Why?
Chandler  If I help, we can find 'em faster!
Rachel  That's right!
Phoebe  Ooh ooh, we have a live one!
Rachel  Oh, it's a Macy's bag!
Rachel  Oh.
Phoebe  Ooh, who's it for?
[Flashback to 209 - TOW Phoebe's Dad]
[Scene  Monica and Rachel's apartment. Joey and Chandler are giving out their Christmas presents out of a cardboard box from a case of motor oil.]
Joey  Rach, these are for you.
Rachel  Wiper blades. I don't even have a car.
Joey  No, but with this new car smell, you'll think you do.
Chandler  OK, Pheebs, your turn.
Phoebe  Ahh, toilet seat covers! Is that what you were doing while I was getting gas?
Joey  Uh-huh.
Phoebe  You guuuyys.
Joey  And for Ross, Mr. Sweet-tooth.
Ross  You got me a cola drink?
Chandler  And, a lemon lime.
Ross  Well this, this is too much, I feel like I should get you another sweater.
Chandler  And last but not least.
Joey  They're ribbed for *your* pleasure.
[Flashback to 710 - TOW The Holiday Armadillo]
[Scene  Monica, Chandler and Phoebe's, Ross is costumed as an Armadillo.]
Ross  Ooh, hey Ben, what if the Holiday Armadillo told you all about the Festival of Lights?
Ben  Cool!
Ross  Yeah!
Monica  Come on Ben.
Ross  Years and years ago there were these people called the Maccabees...
Chandler  (entering in a Santa costume) Ho, ho, ho! Merry Christmas!
Ben  Santa! (Runs to Chandler and hugs him)
Chandler  Hey! (Grunts as Ben hits him at full speed.)
Ross  What are you doing here, Santa?
Chandler  Well, I'm here to see my old buddy Ben. What are you doing here, weird...turtle-man?
Ross  I'm the Holiday Armadillo, your part-Jewish friend. You sent me here to give Ben some presents. Remember?
Chandler  What?
Monica  Okay Ben, why don't you come open some more presents, and Santa, the Armadillo and I have a little talk in the kitchen? There's a sentence I'd never thought I'd say.
Ross  (to Chandler) What are you doing?
Chandler  You called everyone and said you were having trouble finding a Santa costume, so I borrowed one from a guy at work!
Ross  Thank you, but, but you, you gotta leave.
Chandler  Why?
Ross  Because, I'm finally getting him excited about Hanukkah, and, and you're-you're wrecking it.
Chandler  But I didn't get to shake my belly like a bowl full of jelly.
Ross  I'm sorry Chandler, but this, this is really important to me.
Chandler  Fine, I'll give the suit back.
Monica  (to Chandler) Hey, you think, you can keep it another night? (She has a really teasing look on her face and keeps twirling Chandler's beard.)
Chandler  Santa? Really?
Monica  Yeah, is that okay?
Chandler  Did your Dad ever dress up like Santa?
Monica  No.
Chandler  Then it's okaaay! (They kiss.)
[Scene  Back in the conference room in Tulsa.]
Chandler  You know what, everybody? Go home. You should be with your families. It's bad enough that we're working New Year's Eve.
Chandler  Did I not tell *anyone* about New Year's Eve? -- Alright, look, go! Go home, okay? Merry Christmas! Go.
Chandler  Good, God's speed, good people! (he starts to close the door, turns around and sees Wendy) You're not gonna go?
Wendy  Naah... I couldn't leave you alone.
Chandler  Ah. Thanks.
Wendy  Besides, I can't leave until their Christmas party downstairs clears out; there are some *pissed off* insurance people looking for that ham.
Chandler  Ah. (The phone rings; he answers it) Chandler Bing.
[Scene change back an forth  Monica and Chandler's Apartment, Monica's on the other end of the line. The phone's speaker is turned on, so the rest of the gang, sitting around the phone, can hear Chandler.]
Monica  Hi Honey! We're all here; we just want to wish you a Merry Christmas.
Others  (simultaneously) Merry Christmas! (except for Phoebe...)
Phoebe  (simultaneous to the others) Ble-blah-blar Blargh!
Chandler  Ahh, Merry Christmas; I miss you guys!
Monica  So is it horrible? Is everybody working really hard?
Chandler  Ah, well no, it's just uh, me and Wendy.
Monica  Wendy? -- That sounds like a girl's name.
Chandler  It is. Did I... not tell you about her?
Monica  Umhmm, umhmm, about the time you told me about New Year's Eve. Where is everybody else?
Chandler  I sent them home.
Monica  Ohh, you are such a good boss! Is she pretty?
Chandler  Uhh, uh...
Ross  (in a low voice) Answer faster, answer faster!
Chandler  I don't know!
Ross  (in the same low voice) Answer better, answer better!
Chandler  I don't think of her that way, you know, she's a, she's a colleague.
Monica  What does she do there?
Chandler  Oh, she's regional Vice President; She's... just below me.
Monica  She did WHAT?
Chandler  BE-LOW me!
Joey  Ahh, wait, is Wendy the runner-up Miss Oklahoma?
Monica  *What*??
Chandler  Well, she... she didn't win...
Monica  Alright, well, maybe I should let you and the second prettiest girl in Oklahoma get back to work.
Chandler  Well, second prettiest that year; I mean, of *all* the girls in Oklahoma, she's probably...
Rachel  (interrupting him) Oh Chandler, stop talking!
Chandler  Honey, there's really nothing to worry about.
Monica  Okay.
Chandler  I'm serious!
Monica  Okay!
Chandler  Merry Christmas.
Monica  Merry Christmas.
Chandler  Merry Christmas, you guys!
Others  (simultaneously) Yeah, Merry... Christmas. (again, Phoebe...)
Phoebe  (simultaneous to the others) Blah blargah, blar-blab.
[Scene  back in the conference room in Tulsa]
Chandler  (hanging up the phone) The wife says "Hi!".
Wendy  Ah. Fun conversation?
Chandler  Ah well, she's got this weird idea, that, uh, y'know, just because you and I are alone, that something is gonna happen.
Wendy  Huh? Really? -- Hm, that'd be so terrible? (She gets hold of Chandler's tie, slowly moving her hands upwards on the tie, getting closer and closer to him, seductive.)
Chandler  This is probably the wrong thing to be worrying about, but... you're getting ham on my only tie.
[Scene  The conference room in Tulsa again, Chandler is trying to evade Wendy]
Chandler  Whoa-ho, back off, Missy! (He takes a step back, but she still keeps her grip on his tie.)
Wendy  (laughs) ...Missy?
Chandler  I don't know; I'm not used to girls making passes at me! ... (She lets go of his tie) Wait a minute... am I sexy in Oklahoma?
Wendy  You are to me... (She gets closer again, putting her arms around his torso.)
Chandler  (flattered) No,... no... (realizing) NO! (He quickly gets several steps away from her.) Look, I'm, I'm married!
Wendy  So? I'm married. (Showing him the ring on her finger.)
Chandler  I'm *happily* married.
Wendy  Oh. - What's *that* like?
Chandler  Right. So, I'm sorry...
Wendy  Seriously? Happily married. So that phone call before, that was ... happy?
[Flashback to 716 - TOW The Truth About London]
[Scene  London, Chandler's hotel room. He was getting ready for bed when Monica pays him a visit and they started talking]
Chandler  I mean, you were the most beautiful woman in the room tonight!
Monica  Really?
Chandler  You kidding? You're the most beautiful woman in most rooms... (She jumps up and kisses him.) (Breaking the kiss.) Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! What's going on? You and I just made out! You and I are making out?
Monica  Well, not anymore.
Chandler  But we don't do that.
Monica  I know, I just thought it would be fun.
Chandler  How drunk are you?
Monica  Drunk enough that I know I wanna do this. Not so drunk that you should feel guilty about taking advantage.
Chandler  (thinks) That's the perfect amount!
Monica  Okay!
Monica  (breaking the kiss) Y'know what's weird?
Chandler  What?
Monica  This doesn't feel weird!
Chandler  I know.
Monica  You're a really good kisser.
Chandler  Well, I have kissed over four women. (They kiss again.) Do you wanna get under the covers?
Monica  Hm-hmm!
Chandler  Okay!
Monica  Wow! You are really fast!
Chandler  It bodes well for me that speed impresses you.
Monica  We're gonna see each other naked.
Chandler  Yep!
Monica  Do you wanna do it at the same time?
Chandler  Count of three?
Monica  One!
Chandler  Two!
Monica  Two!
Both  Three! (They lift up the covers and check each other out, then come back up with silly grins on their faces.)
Chandler  Well I think it's safe to say that our friendship is effectively ruined.
Monica  Eh, we weren't that close anyway!
Chandler  Eh! (They start making out again)
[Flashback to 503 - TOW The Triplets]
[Scene  A hallway in the hospital, Monica and Chandler are talking.]
Chandler  So, are you really gonna go out with that nurse man?
Monica  Well uh, you and I are just goofing around, I thought, why not just goof around with him.
Chandler  Y'know, I don't know if you've ever looked up the term goofing around in the dictionary... Well, I have, and the technical definition is, two friends who care a lot about each other and have amazing sex and just wanna spend more time together. But if you have this new fangled dictionary that gets you made at me, then we have to, y'know, get you my original dictionary. I am *so* bad at this.
Monica  I think you're better than you think you are.
Chandler  Really? Okay, so...
Monica  (interrupting) Know when to stop.
Chandler  Y'know, I sensed that I should stop. So we're okay?
Chandler  Right!
[Flashback to 524 - TOI Vegas, Part II]
[Scene  The Gift Shop, Monica and Chandler are entering.]
Monica  I can't get married until I get something old, something new, something borrowed, and something blue.
Chandler  Okay, all right, all right, all right! Okay! (Picks up a blue sweater.) Okay, here's something, here's something blue and new.
Monica  You're so efficient. I love you!
Chandler  Let's go! (Starts to leave.)
Monica  No-no-no, wait! We need something old!
Chandler  Oh, okay, I have condom in my wallet that I've had since I was twelve.
Monica  That'll work!
Chandler  I don't think so.
Monica  Okay, now we just need something borrowed!
Chandler  (looks around) Here just...take this. (Hands her the sweater.)
Monica  That's stealing!
Chandler  No, we'll-we'll bring it back! Just put it under your dress.
Monica  Ohh. (Rubs her fake stomach.)
Chandler  Okay, one thing at a time. (They run out to get married.)
[Flashback to 702 - TOW Rachel's Book]
[Scene  Monica, Chandler, and Phoebe's, Chandler is looking at the wedding book as Monica enters.]
Monica  Listen umm, I've been thinking, it's not fair for me to ask you to spend all of your money on our wedding. I mean, you work, you work really hard for that.
Chandler  Ehh.
Monica  Eh, you work for that.
Chandler  Look, I thought about it too, and I'm sorry. I think we should spend all of the money on the wedding.
Monica  You do?!
Chandler  Yeah, I'm putting my foot down. Yeah look, when I proposed I told you that I would do anything to make you happy, and if having the perfect wedding makes you happy, then, then that's what we're gonna do.
Monica  Oh, you're so sweet. (They hug and kiss.) Oh, but wait, what about our, what about the future and stuff?
Chandler  Eh, forget about the future and stuff! So we only have two kids, y'know? We'll pick our favorite and that one will get to go to college.
Monica  You thought about that?
Chandler  Yeah.
Monica  How many kids were we gonna have?
Chandler  Uh, four, a boy, twin girls and another boy.
Monica  What else did you think about?
Chandler  Well, stuff like where we'd live, y'know? Like a small place outside the city, where our kids could learn to ride their bikes and stuff. Y'know, we could have a cat that had a bell on its collar and we could hear it every time it ran through the little kitty door. Of course, we'd have an apartment over the garage where Joey could grow old.
Monica  (laughs) Y'know what? I-I don't want a big, fancy wedding.
Chandler  Sure you do.
Monica  No, I want everything that you just said. I want a marriage.
Chandler  You sure?
Monica  Uh-hmm.
Chandler  I love you so much.
Monica  I love you. (They kiss.)
[Scene  Monica and Chandler's Apartment, everyone except Chandler is there; they're opening their presents]
Rachel  (opens her present from Ross; it's a dark-red scarf) Oohh, I love it!
Ross  Really? You're not gonna return it?
Rachel  Well, not this second!
Phoebe  (at the window) Hey look, you guys, it's snowing!
Rachel  Oh wow, it's so beautiful...
Ross  Wow, it really is!
Monica  "Wendy" is a fat girl name.
Phoebe  Aren't we done with that?
Monica  Okay, fine. Let's talk about snow. -- Do you think it's snowing in Tulsa, where my husband is having sex on a copying machine?
Chandler  Hey!
Ross  Oh my god...
Joey  Hey-heeyyy - Look at that, it's a Christmas miracle!
Monica  What are you doing here?
Chandler  I wanted to be with you. I missed you so much.
Joey  Hey, hey, uh, who did you miss the most?
Chandler  Monica.
Joey  Got ya. (blinks an eye)
Chandler  I never want to leave you again!
Monica  But I thought if you left, you get fired.
Chandler  Turns out they can't fire me. Because I quit.
Monica  What?
Ross  What, you, you really quit your job?
Chandler  Yeah! It's a stupid job, and I could not stand leaving you. And why should I be the only one who doesn't get to do what he *really* wants to do?
Rachel  What do you really want to do?
Chandler  (realizing) I have *not* thought this through!
Monica  Oh my god!
Chandler  I know, I, I should have talked to you first about it.
Monica  No, I think that this is what you wanna do, I think it's great!
Chandler  Thanks!
Phoebe  Chandler, your being here is the best Christmas present I could have ever imagined.
Chandler  (flattered) Ahh...
Phoebe  Now give me my real gift.
Phoebe  (to Chandler) Thank you.
Chandler  (to Monica) Here, pass these, will ya.. (points to the others)
Ross  Oh, hey...
Ross  (reading off his card) "A donation has been made in your name to the New York City Ballet." -- How did you know?
Rachel  Wha... are you kidding? I can't return this.
Chandler  I... thought it was a timely start to thinking about other people. Besides, this gift still says I love you guys.
Joey  Mine's is to Lilian Myers.
Chandler  I don't have a *job*!
[Scene  Monica and Chandler's Apartment, Monica is cleaning up, Chandler is sitting on the couch, checking the Job offers in a Newspaper.]
Monica  You are! (she picks up a bill from the table, handing it to Chandler) Hey, here's twenty bucks. -- Why don't you go buy yourself something pretty while I'm at work tomorrow?
[Scene  Coffee place, Joey is there, Chandler is entering]
Chandler  Hey
Joey  Hey. So where's Mon?
Chandler  Oh, she's at home, putting up decorations for Rachel's birthday party tonight.
Joey  And you're not helping?
Chandler  I tried, but apparantly singing "I will survive" in a helium voice 
  - not helping.
Ross  Hey you guys!
Joey and Chandler  (start to sing) Hey! Happy birthday ...
Rachel  Shhh don't say that loud, Gunther's gonna want to hug me.
Ross  Uh, good news everyone, we finally found a nanny. This is Molly (points 
  to Molly). Molly, Chandler, Joey.
Joey and Chandler  Hi.
Molly  Hi.
Ross  Ooh, somebody's getting a little fussy.
Joey  You damn right I am, I've been waiting for a cookie for 7 minutes.
Rachel  Ok, you know what, I'm just gonna take her outside.
Molly  No, you stay, I'll do it (takes Emma from Rachel).
Rachel  OK, thank you.
Molly  Nice to meet you guys (to Chandler and Joey).
Joey  Yeah, you too.
Rachel  Oh, wow, Molly is just great!
Ross  Yeah.
Chandler  Yes, Bravo on the hot nanny.
Rachel  What? You really think she's hot?
Chandler  Are you kidding? If I wasn't married she'd be rejecting me right now.
Rachel  And Joey?
Joey  How do you think she's doing?
Rachel  Am I the only one who doesn't think that she's hot? Ross?
Ross  Eh, I mean, I mena she's not unattractive but hot? I ....
Rachel  Thank you! (goes to get coffee)
Chandler  Now that Rachel's gone?
Rachel  So hot I cried myself to sleep last night. (Joey and Chandler clap their 
  hands)
[Scene  Mike and Phoebe in Phoebe's place, Phoebe is doing a crossword puzzle]
Phoebe  Hey Mike, what's the capital of Peru?
Mike  Lima.
Phoebe  No. It starts with a "v" and ends with an "x". Helpfully 
  with a "to" in the middle.
Mike  You know, kinda think of it, the capital of Peru IS "vtox". 
  (opens the kitchen cabinet) Oh god! Oh!
Phoebe  What?
Mike  OK, I don't want to freak you out or anything, but I think I just saw a 
  rat in your cupboard.
Phoebe  (relived) Oh, whew, no, that's Bob.
Mike  What, is he your pet rat?
Phoebe  Well not so much a pet as, you know, an occasional visitor who 
  I put food out for, you know. Kinda like Santa. Except Santa doesn't poop on 
  the plate of cookies.
Mike  You can't keep a rat in your appartment! They're extremely unsanitary, 
  and they transmit leptospirosis and hantavirus.
Phoebe  What are those?
Mike  I don't know but they don't sound like spa treatments. You have to get 
  rid of it!
Phoebe  OK, fine, if it means that much to you I'll get rid of Bob.
Mike  Thank you.
Phoebe  So weird, you think he's so gross and you're willing to eat his crackers. 
  (Mike throws out everything in his mouth)
[Scene  Rachel's office, Rachel comes in and Gavin is there]
Rachel  Hello.
Gavin  Hello
Rachel  Gavin, I just wanted to say thank you again for watching Emma 
  yesterday during the presentation. I really owe you an appology.
Gavin  For what?
Rachel  Well, when we first met, you know, I thought you were pompous 
  and arrogant and obnoxious ...
Gavin  Is this your first appology?
Rachel  No, I just mean that, you know, first impressions don't mean anything. And 
  I-I think you're a really good guy and I'm sorry that I misjudged you.
Heather  Good morning!
Rachel  Hello. (to Gavin) But you know what, hey, new day, new leaf, 
  I am just really really happy ... (sees Gavin staring at Heather) I'm sorry, 
  obviously Heather's ass has something more important to say so I'll just wait 
  'till it's finished.
Gavin  What?
Rachel  I was giving you an appology and you were totally checking her out!
Gavin  I wasn't checking her out. I'm in fashion, I was looking at her 
  skirt. Or was it pants? I didn't really see what happened below the ass area.
Rachel  Oh wow, you are really, you're really a creep.
Gavin  Why do you even care if I was looking at her? Are you jealous?
Rachel  Oh yeah, I'm jealous. "Oh Gavin, please, please look at 
  my ass". (Gavin starts looking) Stop looking at my ass! I mean, I just 
  think you are totally inappropriate, ok? This is a work environment, she's your 
  subordinate.
Gavin  I thought it was ok when you slept with your old assistant Tag.
Rachel  That is totally different for two reasons. One - I didn't know 
  that you knew that. And two, I wasn't some creep staring at his ass, we had 
  a deap meaningful relationship.
Gavin  Huh. What's Tag's last name?
Rachel  It was ... (can't remember) oh my god. He didn't have a last 
  name. It was just "Tag". You know, like Cher, or, you know, Moses.
Gavin  But it was a deap meaningful relationship.
Rachel  Oh, you know what - my first impression of you was absolutely 
  right. You are arrogant, you are pompous ... Morgan! Morgan! Tag's last name 
  was Morgan! Huh!
Gavin  It was Jones.
Rachel  Yeah well what are you, his boyfriend?
[Scene  Coffee place, Molly holding Emma and talking to Joey]
Joey  Man, I wish I had a nanny like you.
Molly  You mean, when you were a baby.
Joey  Sure.
Monica  Would you stop staring at her?
Chandler  I wasn't staring. I was leering.
Monica  What's the big deal with her? Maybe she's attractive in an obvious kind 
  of way.
Ross  Yeah, obvious beauty's the worst. You know, when it's right there 
  in your face. Me, I like to have to work to find someone attractive. Makes me 
  feel like I earned it.
Chandler  Looks like Joey is doing allright with her.
Monica  Yeah. Hey, that was nice of you guys to back off and let Joey get the girl 
  for once.
Molly  (to Ross) I'm gonna take her back to the appartment.
Ross  Ok, I'll be home right after work. Ok, by Emma-Wemma-Demma, I love you 
  - wovyou dovyou ...
Molly  Bye
Monica  They've elected me to talk to you about the baby talk - it's not so good.
Molly  I think it's sweet. (goes to leave)
Ross, Joey and Chandler  Bye, Emma-Wemma-Demma.
Rachel  (to Joey) Hey, listen, Joey, about Molly, I really prefer if 
  you didn't go after her.
Joey  Why not?
Rachel  Because it took us months to find a good nanny and I wouldn't want anything 
  to, you know, drive her away.
Joey  So, what, you think I'm just gonna sleep with her and never call 
  her again and things are gonna get uncomfortable? (thinks about it) Yeah, sounds 
  about right.
Ross  Come on, there are plenty of other women out thereok? Just - just 
  forget about her, ok? Just, she's off limits.
Joey  Oh, man, why did have to go and say that for? Now that you told 
  me I can't have it makes me want her even more!
Ross  What are you, a child?
Joey  Yes!
Ross  Joey, come on now, for me! Please, just-just try to focus your sexual energy 
  on someone else.
Joey  Fine. (looks around, then focuses on Monica)
Monica  (to Chandler) Take me home! (they quickly leave)
[Scene  Phoebe's place, Phoebe and Mike are there]
Phoebe  Hey Mikey
Mike  Hey P
Phoebe  What are you doing?
Mike  Setting rat traps.
Phoebe  To kill Bob??
Mike  No, no, to test his neck strength.
Phoebe  No, Mike, I don't want to kill him! I thought we were just gonna 
  capture him and, and you know, set him free in the country side where he can 
  maybe meet a friendly possom and a wisecracking owl.
Mike  Ok, ok, I'll throw away the traps.
Phoebe  I'll find Bob, I'll get him. Bob? (starts looking) Bob! Robert! (looks at 
  cabinet under sink) Oh wait, I think I hear him. Oh - Oh my god! Bob had babies! 
  Bob's a mom!
Mike  Better think of a new name for him.
Phoebe  I don't know, I kinda like Bob for a girl.
Mike  I don't know, I mean I'm not sure (they hear cracking voice from 
  somewhere else in the kitchen, probably a rat caught in a trap) ...
Phoebe  Oh my god, we killed Bob!
Mike  Maybe it wasn't Bob, maybe it was a mouse.
Phoebe  Suzie? (Runs over there to check)
[Scene  Mon and Chan's, Ross enters]
Ross  Whazzup??
Chandler  Seriously dude, 3 years ago.
Ross  Listen, can you do me a favor? I'm gonna be out today. Can you just keep 
  an eye on Joey, make sure nothing happens between him and Molly?
Chandler  You don't trust him?
Ross  Wh - No. Some woman who sounded a lot like Joey called earlier and asked 
  for her daughter, the "hot nanny".
Chandler  Is this really your long term plan, for me to run interference? 
  Because I could get a job any day now.
Ross  You do appear right on the cusp of something. Come on man, I'm 
  sure he'll lose interest in a week or two, but for now can you please just do 
  this for me?
Chandler  Allright, fine, but don't blame me if it doesn't work. Because you know 
  as well as I do that once Joey sets his mind on something, more often than not, 
  he's going to have sex with it.
Ross  Well we gotta do something, ok? Nannies like her don't grow on trees. (pause)
Chandler  Picturing that tree?
Ross  I am, yes.
[Scene  Hallway, Joey get out of his appartment and Chandler jumps out of 
  his]
Chandler  Where you going, Joe?
Joey  For a walk.
Chandler  Oh. You mind if I join you?
Joey  Actually, that will be long. You know, I really need to organize 
  my thoughts.
Chandler  Your thoughts? Plural?
Joey  Allright, fine, I only have one thought! It's about the hot nanny, I gotta 
  see her!
Chandler  I'm afraid I can't let you do that, Joe.
Joey  Now YOU'RE telling me I can't see her?? You guys are killing me! 
  She's forbidden fruit! It's like ... like she's the princess and I'm the stable 
  boy ... Why are you doing this, huh? Did Ross tell you not to let me go over 
  there?
Chandler  Yes, as a matter of fact he did, so I can't let you go.
Joey  Huh. Interesting. Now there are obstacles. Hot nanny and me against the 
  world. This is the kind of stuff great novels are made of.
Chandler  Great novels?
Joey  Fine ... mediocre porn
[Scene  Rachel's office, Rachel and Gavin there, phone rings, Gavin picks 
  it up]
Gavin  Gavin Mitchelle's office.
Rachel  Rachel Green's office!! Give me that phone! (takes the phone) 
  Hello, this is Rachel Green, how can I help you? Uh huh ... ok then ... I'll 
  pass you back to your son (gives phone to Gavin)
Gavin  Hey Mom! No, that's just my secretary. (Rachel is upset)
Rachel  Um, excuse me Gavin, I have a question I need to ask you.
Gavin  Mom, I'll call you later. Yeah. (hangs up) (to Rachel) Yes?
Rachel  If you like looking at butts so much why don't you just go look at a mirror?
Gavin  Thank god you finally said that, I saw you make a note on your 
  pad three hours ago. (Rachel throws away that paper) Man, I really bug you, 
  don't I?
Rachel  Oh, please, I don't care about you enough to bug me. In fact, 
  from now on, I'm going take the high road. And I'm going be very very nice to 
  you, you "momma's boy", starting right now.
Monica  Hey Rach!
Rachel  Hi!
Monica  Ready for your birthday lunch?
Rachel  Yeah I am, I am! Oh, but first of all, Monica, I would like to introduce 
  you to my very talented colleage and more importantly my wonderful friend Gavin 
  Mitchelle.
Gavin  Pleased to meet you.
Monica  Pleased to meet you. So you're coming to Rachel's party tonight?
Rachel  Oh no no no no no, Gavin can't, he already has plans, most likely with his 
  mother.
Gavin  Well I don't mind, I'll cancel. I would never miss my secretary's birthday. 
  (leaves)
Rachel  Why did you invite him?? I can't stand that guy!
Monica  You were just being so nice to him!
Rachel  I was faking it! Can't you tell when I'm being fake?
Rachel  Hey, Mr Philips, nice suit!
Monica  Right there! That was so fake!
Rachel  Shh!
[Scene  Rachel's birthday party]
Rachel  (to Monica) I still can't believe you invited Gavin. Allright, he is the 
  last person I want to see.
Monica  Oh, you're welcome for the party. I'm glad you're having a good time.
Rachel  God, I hope he doesn't show up. Of course he's not gonna show up, the guy 
  hates me.
Monica  Does he?
Rachel  What?
Monica  Maybe he's bothering you so much because he likes you. It's like in first 
  grade when Skippy Langwild always pushed me on the playground because he secretly 
  had a crush on me?
Rachel  Oh, Monica, you think Skippy liked you? Honey, all those buys had a bet 
  to see if he can knock you over.
Molly  (with Emma in a basinet) She's out, I'm gonna take her home.
Rachel  Oh, ok, thank you. (Molly leaves) (to Monica) Do you see what all the guys 
  see in her?
Monica  Wouldn't kick her out of bed. No more Vodka for me! (put her glass down)
Joey  Hey Rach, so can I sing happy birthday to you now?
Rachel  Yeah, sure!
Joey  Oh ... (Starts to sing) Happy birth ... (sees Molly leaving) oh, see you 
  later (runs after Molly)
Monica  Hey Rach, somebody got you shoes!
Rachel  Oh, give me! (opens the box happily, then gets freaked and throws away the 
  box, she and Mon jump up the sofa)
Phoebe  Be careful, be careful! These are my rat babies!
Mike  Yeah. We have rat babies now.
Rachel  Ahhhh , you brought rats to my birthday party?
Monica  So this is what a stroke feels like.
Phoebe  I had to bring them! We killed their mother, they're our responsibility 
  now. You know, they require constant care. You should know that, Rachel, you're 
  a mother.
Rachel  Are you comparing my daughter to a rat?
Phoebe  No! Seven rats! I think we should take them home, we need feed 
  them.
Rachel  whhh wait, you're gonna leave my party to take care of a box of rats?
Phoebe  Well I'm sorry Rachel, but I'm not like you, ok? Not everyone 
  can afford help. (she and Mike leave)
Ross  Where the hell are Joey and Molly? I asked you to watch them.
Chandler  (In a helium voice, holding a balloon) I'm sorry, I got a little occupied.
Ross  We have to stop them before something happens!
Chandler  (still helium voice) Right behind you, big guy! (they both head for the 
  door)
[Scene  Ross's place, Molly and Joey are talking on the couch]
Joey  So you see, Molly, what people don't understand is that acting is a discipline. 
  It takes a lot of hard work.
Molly  So where did you study?
Joey  Oh, I didn't go to college.
Molly  No, where did you study acting?
Joey  Molly ... people don't study acting ...
Ross  Molly, ah, do you mind giving us just a minute?
Molly  Sure, I'll go check on Emma.
Ross  Thanx.
Joey  (upset) Will the stable boy never get the princess??
Ross  What do you think you're gonna do, have sex with her right here on my couch?
Joey  No ... the leather sticks to my ass. You know, this isn't fair. 
  What makes you think that I'm just gonna sleep with her and then blow her off? 
  Huh? Can't you guys open your minds to the possibility that I actally like her, 
  and might want something real? (pause) Look, the truth is, I haven't felt this 
  way about anyone since Rachel, ok? I didn't think I could ever love again.
Ross and Chandler  Come on! Joe!
Joey  Ok (admits)
Woman  Hi, is Molly here?
Ross  Yeah, come on in. Molly?
Molly  (goes out of the room) Hey! Guys, this is Tabatha (they kiss on the lips 
  in a romantic way). (to Ross) I'll see you tomorrow.
Ross  Ok ... (they leave the room, long pause) Well, uh, Joey, I guess we have 
  no problem.
Joey  It's like my favorite fairy tale come true! (Chandler looks at him) The 
  princess, the stable boy and the lesbian!
[Scene  Phoebe's place, Phoebe and Mike enter]
Phoebe  Ok, ok, you start preparing the formula and I start changing 
  the box and then we gotta put them straight to bed.
Mike  Hey, when did we become one of those couples whose lives revolve 
  around their rats?
Phoebe  Well, you know what, they're our responsibility now.
Mike  Ok, fine, these rats are our responsibility. What happens when they mate 
  and there are hundreds of them?
Phoebe  Mate? They're all brothers and sisters.
Mike  Yeah - not such a problem with rats. No, they're more of a "love 
  the one you're with" kind of animals.
Phoebe  No. (opens the box) wh - get off your sister! Oh my god, what 
  are we gonna do? We have 7 rats. So what if each of them has 7 rats? And then 
  each of those have 7 rats? That's like ... (starts counting with her fingers) 
  That's math I can't even do! What are we gonna do?
Mike  Well, I know this is gonna sound crazy, but, we could not let 
  the box of rats ruin our lives.
Phoebe  Yeah, ok. I guess you're right. Allright, so we should just give them away. 
  But to nice families, with children, and reduced fat wheat thins. They're Bob's 
  favorites.
Mike  It's gonna be ok.
Phoebe  You must think I'm crazy.
Mike  No, I think you're sweet.
Phoebe  Good. It's just so hard, it's hard for me to ... let them go. 
  I guess it just brings back memories, you know, from ... when I gave birth to 
  my brother's triplets and I had to give them up. (Mike is shocked) I haven't 
  told you about that yet, have I?
[Scene  Rachel's party, Rachel is on the balcony, Monica goes there also]
Monica  Hey!
Rachel  Hi. Thanks for the party, honey. Should I help you clean up?
Monica  No way! You had your party, now I have mine! Is everything alright?
Rachel  Yeah, I just get a little bummed when my birthday's over.
Monica  Well, at least you have one thing to be happy about. That jerk Gavin from 
  your office didn't show up (Gavin shows up at the balcony windows).
Rachel  Mmm hmm.
Gavin  Yeah, hey. (comes in to the balcony)
Monica  Oh, we weren't talking about you. No, no way to recover.
Rachel  No.
Gavin  Nice party.
Monica  (from inside) Again, you're welcome.
Gavin  Look, I'll just give you this and go.
Rachel  Oh, you bought me a present! Why?
Gavin  Well, let me explain how birthday parties usually work. There 
  are presents, and a cake, perhaps a fourth or fifth person. Ok, I ... got you 
  the present to make up for being such a jerk to you earlier.
Rachel  Aww. Well, ok, well that's very nice. And you wrote a card (opens 
  the card). "From Gavin"
Gavin  I really mean it.
Rachel  (opens the present, it's a green scarf) Awww, awww, it's beautiful.
Gavin  You don't mind? (puts it around her neck) Well, what do you know, it fits!
Rachel  See, Gavin, you're capable of being a nice guy. Why did you give me such 
  a hard time?
Gavin  I'm not sure.
Rachel  Well Monica seems to think it's because you have feelings for me.
Gavin  I do have feelings for you.
Rachel  You do?
Gavin  Yes, I feel that you are a little annoying.
Rachel  See? Why, Gavin, why? Right when I'm about to change my opinion 
  of you, you go and you ... (he kisses her) and you do that ... (they kiss again)
Chandler  (sings in a helium voice) First I was afraid, I was petrified (very happy)
Phoebe  (walks in) Hey
Chandler  (normal voice) Hi
Phoebe  Listen, I think I've left something here.
Chandler  Oh, well someone left this (shows a green jacket). This is yours?
Phoebe  (likes the jacket) No, but I like it. I think I left one of 
  my rat babies.
Chandler  Oh, uh, well, I haven't seem it but if I do I'll let you know.
Monica  Ohmygod! Rat baby! Rat baby! Rat baby! (screams from another room)
Phoebe  (realizes) Ooh, maybe that's him!

[Scene  Joey and Rachel's apartment. Rachel is in the kitchen
      as Joey enters from his bedroom.]
Joey  Morning, roomie!
Rachel  Hey! You remembered to put clothes on this morning.
Joey  Fifth day's a charm.
Rachel  Oh, Joey, it's so great to be back here. I gotta tell you, you're
      making it so easy on me and Emma.
Joey  Hey, it's great having you back. You know, stay as long as you want,
      and when does she stop crying all night?
Ross  Hey, you're not naked! So hey, Rach, when will we expect to see you
      tonight?
Rachel  Well, I'll probably be back to pick her up around six, but she's
      in the bedroom all ready to go. But she did actually fall back to sleep,
      so...
Joey  She's probably exhausted from all that adorable screaming she did
      last night.
Rachel  Bye!
Ross  Bye! Hey, I hope Emma isn't making it too hard on you.
Joey  No, hey, it's been great.
Ross  Yeah?
Joey  Yeah. And look, I just want you to know that with Rachel staying
      here and everything, all my feelings from before are totally over, okay?
      And even if they weren't, when you accidentally walk in on a woman using
      a breast pump...
Ross  Yeah, that'll do it.
Joey  Wow! So, how are you?
Ross  I'm, I'm okay.
Joey  Really?
Ross  Sure, I mean, do I wish me and Rachel living together would have
      worked out? Of course. You know, I'm disappointed, but it's not like it's
      a divorce.
Joey  Well, actually it...
Ross  No, it's not a divorce, it is not a divorce! Anyway, I think Rachel
      and I need to, you know, get on with our lives, maybe, maybe start seeing
      other people.
Joey  Wow, really?
Ross  Yeah, sure, why not? In fact, if you know anyone that would be good
      for me...
Joey  Sure, I know lots of girls.
Ross  Yeah? Any names come to mind?
Joey  Ooh, names?
[Scene  Joey and Rachel's apartment. Joey is there as Phoebe
      enters.]
Phoebe  Hey.
Joey  Hey. I was just gonna get something to eat. You want something?
Phoebe  What you got?
Joey (checks the refrigerator)  Okay, let's see, we got strained peas,
      strained carrots... Ooh! Strained plums. We haven't tried that yet.
Phoebe  Goodie! Thanks. So, how is it living with Rachel again? I mean, apart
      from the great food.
Joey  I'm fine, I'm fine, it's just, it's just weird what's happening with
      her and Ross. You know, yesterday he asked me to fix him up with somebody.
Phoebe  Oh my god, Rachel asked me if I knew anyone for her too.
Joey  Why are they doing this?
Phoebe  I don't know. They're so perfect for each other; it's crazy.
Joey  You know what's crazy? These jars. What is it, like two bites in
      here?
Phoebe  I just wish they'd realise they should be together.
Joey  I know, I know. And when they moved back in together, I figured y'know,
      that's where things were headed.
Phoebe  I know. They should be a family. They should get married and have
      more children.
Joey  Yes, and they should name one of their kids Joey. I may not have
      kids; someone's gotta carry on the family name.
Phoebe  You know what? Maybe once they start dating, and they see what's
      out there, they'll realise how good they are for each other.
Phoebe  So, what are we gonna do? Are we just gonna go ahead and set them
      up with people?
Joey  I know; that just pushes them further and further apart.
Phoebe  Yeah. (BEAT) Oh, I know what we can do. We could set Ross and Rachel
      up on horrible dates, so that they'll realise how good they are together.
Joey  Ooh, that's a great plan!
Phoebe  Yeah, you know what the best part of it is? I get to do my "plan-laugh." (A
      maniacal laugh follows.)
Joey  Shhh! Not so loud, we don't wanna wake up, uh...
[Scene  Monica and Chandler's apartment. They're in the
      kitchen as Rachel enters.]
Rachel  Hey!
Monica  Hey!
Rachel  You guys aren't doing anything tonight, are you?
Chandler  See, now, why would you assume that? Just because we're married?
      I will have you know that we are very hip, happening people. Now, if you'll
      excuse me, I have to get back to reading the obituaries.
Rachel  I was just asking 'cause I need someone to watch Emma tonight.
Monica  Sure, we'll do that. What are you up to?
Rachel  Well, Phoebe set me up on a date.
Monica  Oh my god.
Chandler  Wow.
Rachel  Why? What's the big deal?
Monica  Just figured, 'cause you and Ross are...
Rachel  What, slept together a year and a half ago? Yeah, I'm all set.
Chandler  Well, I think it's great that you're going on a date, you know? I
      mean, it sounds healthy. I mean, you have needs. Embrace your womanhood!
Monica  You want a job? Turn off "Oprah," and send out a resume!
Rachel  So I'll bring her by around seven? Is that okay?
Monica  Oh, it's perfect.
Rachel  Oh, you guys are gonna have so much fun! She's at such a cute age.
      Oh, a couple things. Now that she's eating solid food, she poops around
      the clock. And watch out for your hair, 'cause she likes to grab it. And
      oh, she's also in this phase where if you leave the room, she screams bloody
      murder, but ah... Thanks, you guys. Have fun!
Chandler (reading the newspaper)  Suddenly I wish I was reading my own name.
[Scene  Central Perk. Joey is drinking coffee by the counter
      as Phoebe enters.]
Phoebe  Ooh, Joey.
Joey  Hey.
Phoebe  Hey. I'm so excited; I just set up Rachel with the worst guy tonight.
Joey  All right! Who is he?
Phoebe  Well, it's this guy I used to massage. And by massage, I mean hold
      down so he wouldn't turn over and flash me.
Joey (gives a thumbs up sign)  Okay, okay. Wait till you hear who I got
      for Ross.
Phoebe  Oh, yeah.
Joey  She's this really boring woman. She's a teacher!
Phoebe  A teacher?
Joey  Yeah, yeah, she's really into history and foreign movies... And oh,
      oh, she loves puzzles. Huh? Come on, who loves puzzles?
Phoebe  Well, Ross does. What... You're - you're ruining the plan! Joey,
      you've - you've fixed him up with his perfect woman!
Joey  Oh my god, you're right!
Phoebe  Yeah.
Joey  She even reads for pleasure!
Phoebe  How do you even know a woman like that?
Joey  What? I'm not allowed to know smart women?
Phoebe  Joey.
Joey  I met her at the library. I went in to pee.
Phoebe  So now what do we do?
Joey  Well, okay, I'll - I'll just call her and tell her the date's cancelled,
      and find him somebody else.
Phoebe  What if we don't find him somebody else? We'll just tell her the
      date's off, but we don't tell Ross, and he goes to the restaurant and gets
      stood up!
Joey  Ooh...I hear that's bad.
Phoebe  Ooh, so this is great! Rachel's gonna have a terrible date, Ross
      gets stood up, and then they'll realise how good they have it together.
Joey  Ah, yes, The Plan! (Laughs loudly again, but he sounds more like
      Santa Claus.)
Phoebe  It's not Santa's plan. No, it's... (Laughs the real "plan-laugh.")
Joey  Yeah, you know, it's not that fun.
Phoebe  No, I think we killed it.
[Scene  Monica and Chandler's apartment. Emma is there
      in her playpen, while Chandler is behind the couch.]
Chandler  Emma? Emma? Look at me! Well, I think I'll go downstairs for a while.
Chandler  No, no, no, no! No, no, no, no! It's okay, it's okay. I didn't go.
      Don't cry, it's just a bit! I'm your uncle Chandler; funny is all I have!
Monica  Okay, just so you know, I'm gonna be ovulating from tomorrow until
      the sixth, so don't touch yourself in the next 48 hours.
Chandler  I don't do that.
Chandler  I'll try to stop. Wait, did you say until the sixth?
Monica  Yeah.
Chandler  Today is the sixth.
Monica  No, it's not.
Chandler  Yes, it's also 2003.
Monica  Oh my god. Today's the sixth?! I may be done ovulating! I may have
      also served some very questionable meat at the restaurant.
Chandler  It's okay. Go take the test and see if we're okay.
Monica  Okay.
Chandler  Tough crib.
Monica  Hey, where are all my ovulation-sticks? There's only one here.
Chandler  I might have checked to see if I was ovulating a couple times.
Monica  Chandler!
Chandler  I am not working. There's not much to do around here!
[Scene  Delmonico's restaurant. Ross is waiting for his
      blind date to show up. A waiter walks past him.]
Ross  Excuse me, is there a woman waiting at the bar? Someone average height,
      dark hair, perhaps doing a puzzle?
Waiter  Uh, there's a drunk Chinese guy.
Ross  Well, if I'm still here in an hour, buy him a drink on me.
Waiter  Can I get you another glass of wine?
Ross  Nah, I don't know if I should. I don't wanna be drunk when I go home
      alone.
Waiter  Got stood up, huh?
Ross  Yeah, it's no big deal. It's just a blind date.
Waiter  Are you worried your date came, saw you, and left?
Ross  No!
[Scene  Monica and Chandler's apartment. Monica emerges
      from the bathroom.]
Monica  We're okay. I'm still ovulating.
Chandler  Oh, good, because as of four o'clock this afternoon, I am not.
Monica  So, let's do this.
Chandler  I - I don't think I can.
Monica  Come on. I know you're not eighteen anymore, but give it a minute.
Chandler  Because of Emma.
Monica  Oh my god, Emma. Oh, sweetie, I forgot you were here. Oh, you're
      right, we can't do this. We can't leave her alone.
Chandler  Sorry.
Monica  Unless... Maybe we do it here. I mean, how much can she even be aware
      of at this age?
Chandler  Well, she's aware when we leave the room. She may notice if we start...
      canoodling in it.
Monica  Canoodling?
Chandler  Well, I can't say "hump" or "screw" in front
      of the B-A-B-Y.
Monica  I don't know. I mean, I guess having sex in front of a baby isn't
      so...
Chandler  Horrifying? Scarring? Something people go to jail for?
Monica  I guess you're right.
Chandler  You guess I'm right? When we stayed at that bed and breakfast, you
      wouldn't have sex with me because you thought a deer was staring through
      the window.
Monica  But what kind of a sick bastard wants to do it in front of a deer?
[Scene  Another restaurant. Rachel is studying the menu
      together with her date, Steve. Steve is the stoned restaurateur from 115
      TOW the Stoned Guy.]
Rachel  Wow, everything looks so good! I think I'm gonna have the chicken.
Steve (staring at Rachel)  I - I just have to say this; you're really beautiful.
Rachel  Oh, well, that's - that's very sweet. Thank you.
Steve  I'm kind of funny looking.
Rachel  What?
Steve  Oh, come on, you're way out of my league. Everybody in here knows
      it. Bet that guy over there's probably saying, "ooh, why she out with
      him? He must be rich!" Well, I'm not!
Rachel (feeling awkward)  So, what do think you wanna order? I'm really
      excited about that chicken.
Steve  I'm not funny either. So, if you were thinking, "well, he's
      not that good-looking, but maybe we'll have some laughs"... That ain't
      gonna happen.
Rachel  Well, come on, Steve; let's not rule out nervous laughter. Hey, now
      wait a minute. Phoebe told me that - that you owned your own restaurant.
      That's impressive.
Steve  I lost it. To drugs.
Steve  I silk-screen t-shirts now.
Rachel  Really? What's that like?
Steve  It's really fulfilling doing something you hate for no money. That's
      right. I have no money, I'm not funny, I live in a studio apartment with
      two other guys, and I'm pretty sure I'm infertile.
Rachel (awkward chuckle)  Now, come on, come on, Steve. There must be something
      that you like about yourself.
Steve  I do like my hair.
Rachel  Really?
[Scene  Central Perk. Phoebe and Joey are there. Phoebe's
      cell phone rings.]
Phoebe  Hello?
Rachel  Phoebe, it's me. I'm going to hunt you down and kill you!
Phoebe  Hey, Rach!
Rachel  This is the worst date ever. How could you set me up with this creep?
Phoebe  You know, you are talking about one of my dear, dear friends.
Rachel  I don't care! This guy is a nightmare!
Phoebe  Oh, right, so he gets a little crazy when he's stoned.
Rachel  He's not stoned.
Phoebe  Did he go out for a cigarette?
Rachel  Yeah, four times.
Phoebe  My dear, sweet Rach.
Phoebe (to Joey)  Well, our plan is working. Rachel is having a miserable
      time, and Ross is just stood up somewhere at a restaurant all alone.
Joey  Oh, great, pretty soon they'll be back together.
Phoebe  By the time anyone's figured out what we've done, we'll be in sunny
      Mexico. (BEAT) Oh, wait, that's the end of a different plan.
[Scene  Monica and Chandler's apartment. Emma has fallen
      asleep in her playpen, and Chandler has fallen asleep right next to her
      on the floor. He's even sucking on a pacifier.]
Monica  She's asleep. Chandler?
Monica  What are you doing?
Chandler  Emma was doing it!
Monica  She's asleep.
Chandler  Ooh, she's asleep, that means we can...
Monica  Yes, but we have to be fast.
Chandler (laughs)  Okay, I'll try. And you can't make any noise.
Monica (laughs)  Okay, I'll try.
Joey  Hello?
Joey  Emma? Hey! Hi!
Joey  How are ya? How are ya? Where are your babysitters, huh? Why's the
      bedroom door closed?
Joey  You can't have S-E-X, when you're taking care of the B-A-B-I-E!
[Scene  Delmonico's. Ross is still waiting for his date
      and drinking wine. The waiter comes up to him again.]
Waiter  I've got bad news. The Chinese guy left.
Ross  Eh, if it was meant to be, it's meant to be.
Waiter  Look; you got stood up, who cares? We're gonna show you a good time.
      Just sit and relax. In fact, let me bring you a crab cake appetizer on
      the house.
Ross  Wow, free crab cakes. Well, that's nice. Although I was hoping to
      have sex tonight.
Waiter  Ooh...
Ross  Just the crab cakes.
Waiter #2  What are you
      doing? Are you trying to get him to stay? Because you can't do that.
Waiter  Just get out of here, okay?
Ross  What's - what's going on?
Waiter  Eh, okay, the waiters have a little pool going. We have a bet on
      how long it'll take before you give up and go home.
Ross  What? You - you're making money off my misery?
Ross  This is unbelievable. I - I have never been so insulted in my life.
      Now, if you'll wrap up my free crab cakes, I'll be on my way.
[Scene  Monica and Chandler's apartment. They're done and
      come out of their bedroom. Emma is still gone.]
Monica  Well, that was weird. You were loud, and I was fast.
Chandler  I think we may have really done it this time.
Monica  Oh, I wish I didn't have to wait to take a pregnancy test.
Chandler  You may wanna get some more of those too.
Chandler  Where's Emma?
Monica  Oh my god, where's Emma? Where's Emma?
Chandler  Don't ask me, I was in there canoodling you!
Monica  Okay, okay, I'm sure that Rachel came home early and picked up Emma.
      You go look across the hall, and I'll call her cell.
Chandler  Okay. (Runs out.)
Monica  Hey, you better hope that we're pregnant, because one way or another,
      we're giving a baby back to Rachel.
[Scene  The street in front of Central Perk. Rachel and
      Steve are walking home from their date. Steve is sobbing.]
Steve (sobbing)  I - I can't believe I’m crying in front of you. You must
      think I'm so pathetic.
Rachel  No, no, no, I admire a man who can cry.
Steve  Really?
Rachel  Don't touch my coat!
Rachel  Oh, sorry, it's my phone. Hello?
Monica (on phone)  Hey, Rach, how's it going?
Rachel  Oh my god, this is the worst date ever!
Rachel (to Steve)  Look, you know what, I'm sorry, but did you really think
      that this was going well? (To Monica.) What's up?
Monica  Hey, did you stop by here?
Rachel  No.
Monica  Oh my god, then...
Monica  Oh, thank god! Emma, there you are!
Rachel  What? What do you mean, "there you are"? Where was she?
Monica  Oh, we were playing "peek-a-boo." She just – she loves
      it when I'm dramatic.
Monica (to Joey)  Why the hell did you take her?
Joey  Because you two were having sex!
Monica  No, we weren't!
Joey  Don't you lie to me! I could tell by Chandler's hair. (To Chandler.)
      You are so lazy. Can't you get on top for once?
Chandler  All right, all right, we were. We were trying to make a baby. Monica's
      ovulating.
Joey  Hey! It is unacceptable that you two would have sex with Emma in
      the next room. I'm gonna have to tell Rachel about this.
Chandler  No, no, no.
Monica  No, please don't. Please, Joey. She will kill us!
Joey  Hey, I gotta! Unless...
Monica  Unless what?
Joey  Unless you name your firstborn child Joey.
Chandler  What? Why?
Joey  Hey, I may never have kids, and somebody's gotta carry on my family
      name.
Chandler  Your family name is Tribbiani.
Joey  (BEAT) (Laughs.) You almost had me.
[Scene  The street in front of Central Perk. Steve and
      Rachel are still there.]
Rachel  Well, uh...
Steve  Look, I think I know the answer to this question, but... Would you
      like to make love to me?
Rachel  Really, really not.
Steve  Eh, it's just as well. Doesn't work anyway.
Rachel  All right, well that's good to know. Good night, Steve.
Ross  Hey, what's wrong?
Rachel  I just had a rough night.
Ross  Oh. Crab cake?
Rachel  Eww!
Ross  Well, what happened?
Rachel  Oh, well, I...It's kind of weird talking to you about this, but...
Ross  Monica told me you had a blind date.
Rachel  Yeah.
Ross  I did, too.
Rachel  Oh.
Ross  But is it technically a date if the other person doesn't show up?
Rachel  Oh, oh no. Do you think she walked in, saw you and left?
Ross  Why does everyone keep saying that?
Rachel  Well, if it makes you feel any better, I wish my date hadn't shown
      up.
Ross  That bad?
Rachel  Well, he makes t-shirts for a living, and he thought it would be
      appropriate to give me this.
Ross  Female body inspector? What size is that?
Phoebe  Now, wait a minute. So, they're gonna name their first child Joey?
Joey  Uh-huh.
Phoebe  How - how do I get them to name the next one after me?
Joey  It's easy, you just walk in on them having sex.
Phoebe  Oh, so they owe me like, three Phoebes.
Phoebe  Oh my god! Look, it's Ross and Rachel. Oh, the plan is working.
Phoebe  Don't, don't do the plan-laugh.
Ross  The first date we've had in months, and they were both such disasters.
Rachel  Oh. Huh. You know, it is weird that Phoebe would
      set me up on a date that was awful on the same night that Joey set you
      up on a date that didn't even show.
Ross  Wait a minute; you don't think it was intentional? I mean, that's
      just stupid.
Joey  We're geniuses! Yeah, look at them, look at them, they're really
      bonding.
Phoebe  Oh, yeah, they're falling in love all over again.
Phoebe  Oh, they see us! Oh, they, they look mad. Oh, they figured it out.
      They're coming this way. Run!
Joey  Where?
Phoebe  Mexico!
[Scene  Delmonico's restaurant. Ross and Joey are sitting
      at a table for four. The waiter is pouring water in their glasses.]
Joey  Can you believe they're still not here?
Ross  I know. A double blind date, and we both get stood up. What are the
      chances?
Joey  I know, I'm so bummed. Can we have our free crab cakes now?
Waiter  What?
Joey  We've been stood up. (sniffles) And we want our free crab cakes.
Waiter  Guys, give it a rest. Nobody's betting on you tonight. Although we
      do have a pool going to see how long it takes that guy to cry.
Steve  I have such fat hands!

[Scene  Chandler and Monica's apartment. Chandler and Monica are looking through
  some papers.]
Chandler  Did you see our bank statement? Can this be right?
Monica  I know...God. I haven't seen my savings take a hit like this since
  I was a kid and they came up with double-stuffed Oreos. What happened to all
  our money?
Chandler  I'm not sure what they did, but I'm inclined to blame Enron.
Monica  I guess with you doing the internship, we're just spending more than
  we're bringing in.
Chandler  Maybe I should quit and get a job that pays.
Monica  Oh, But you're finally doing something that you love! I can't ask
  you to give that up. Though it'd be nice if the thing that you love was y'know...
  finding gold.
Chandler  You know what? You know what? I think we're making too big a deal
  out of this. ok? So we pay our bills a little late this month and maybe next
  month we cut back on a few things. And maybe we start eating out of Joey's
  refrigerator for a change. You're chef... what can you make out of backing
  soda and beer?
Monica  Ok worse case scenario is...we borrow some money from my parents.
Chandler  No! We're not borrowing money.
Monica  Why not?
Chandler  Because we don't do that. We are Bings! And if there's one thing
  my father taught me was... well to always knock before going into the pool
  house... but the other thing was never borrow money.
Monica  Wow! I Had no idea you had this much pride.
Chandler  That's right! I do! And I'm your man. And I'm going to get us through
  this situation even if it means you working twice as hard.
[Scene  Phoebe's apartment. Mike and Phoebe seem to have finished watching
  a movie on television.]
Mike  I'm gonna go. (He kisses Phoebe on the cheek)
Phoebe  Why??
Mike  I haven't been home in a couple of days and I need to get some more
  clothes.
Phoebe  Oh...you don't have to go, I have something that will fit you.
Mike  I put that tube top on as a joke.
Phoebe  I want you to stay.
Mike  I want to stay too but I've gone as bad as much use out of these boxers
  as I can..
Phoebe  Why don't you turn them inside ou...
Mike  Done it. (Phoebe becomes a little more subdued) I'll be back in a couple
  of hours.
Phoebe  I'll miss you.
Mike  Me too. (He leaves. A few moments later, he enters again.) You know
  what? I just realised something. I don't wanna go home.
Phoebe  Great! Ok...I'll go get the tube top.
Mike  No, no! What I mean is, I hate going back to my apartment now... and
  partly because I live above a known crack den but... mostly because when I'm
  there, It's just, I really miss you. So.. do you want to move in together?
Phoebe  Wow, Mike Hannigan...You sure know how to make a girl say "Hell
  yeah!"
Mike  So we're doing it?
Phoebe  Yeah! Let's do it! Let's live together! (They embrace and Mike kisses
  Phoebe) Oh god, we're really going to move in together!
Mike  Yeah!
Phoebe  I've always wanted to live with a guy. "Pick up your socks!" "Put
  down the toilet seat!" "No! We're not having sex anymore!" It's
  gonna be fun!
[Scene  Joey's apartment. Monica enters.]
Monica  Hey Joey!
Joey  Hey!
Monica  Listen...I need to know that what I'm about to ask you, will never
  get back to Chandler.
Joey  I'd be lying if I said I haven't thought about it myself. Chandler is
  my best friend, it would be wrong. Good...(He winks)...But wrong.
Monica  (Looks exasperated) Ok first of all...It would be great. But that's
  not what I'm here to talk to you about. I need to borrow some money.
Joey  Aww, I don't know Monica y'know... erm... lending friends money is always
  a mistake.
Monica  But Chandler lent you money!
Joey  And I think he would tell you it was a mistake.
Monica  Come on...I just need it for some rent and..and some other bills.
Joey  Oh...how much?
Monica  Two thousand dollars?
Joey  Two thousand dollars!? What do you think I am? I soap opera star!?
Monica  Yeah...
Joey  That's right I am! (Opens drawer and rummages through it. Rachel enters)
Rachel  Hi you guys!
Joey & Monica  Hey!
Joey  Oo...what's in the bag?
Rachel  Oh er... well you know Emma started crawling? I realised that this
  place, is very unsafe for a baby. So I went to the store and got some stuff
  to baby-proof the apartment.
Joey  Oh...baby-proofing... Why is this such a big deal now? Y'know, when
  I was a kid it was like.. "Whoops! Joey fell down the stairs!" or
  er.. "Whoops! Joey electrocuted himself again!" Huh!
Monica  Anyway erm, are you going to get a handyman to install this stuff?
Rachel  No. I was just going to do this myself. (Joey makes a sarcastic laugh.)
Joey  You're gonna do it?
Rachel  Yeah, Why? You don't think a woman can do this?
Joey  Oh, women can. You can't.
Rachel  Monica...would you please tell Joey that he is a pig?
Monica  You're a pig. And you can't do this.
Rachel  Wha!? What!? Come on! I found the hardware store all by myself!
Joey  The hardware store is right down the street.
Rachel  There is a hardware store right down the street?
[Scene  Central Perk. Ross, Chandler and Monica are sitting on the couch.
  Phoebe and Mike enters.]
Phoebe  Hey you guys! Ok, we've got great news.
Mike  Phoebe and I are moving in together.
Monica, Chandler, Ross  Congratulations!/Good for you!/Great!
Phoebe  I know it's so exciting! You know I've never lived with a guy before.
Monica  Well you know it's just like living with a girl. Only they don't steal
  your makeup. Unless they're playing "This is what my sister would look
  like" (Looks at Chandler)
Chandler  Yeah.... she's not so cute.
Mike  I'm gonna go to the bathroom.
Phoebe  Okay, well you put down the toilet seat.
Mike  Yes dear.
Monica  Is that a bit you guys do?
Phoebe  Uh huh...we're playing you two.
Monica  We don't do that! Tell her we don't do that!
Chandler  Yes dear.
Ross  I can't believe you guys are moving in together. That's, that's great!
  I mean...I'm happy for you guys..
Monica  I hear wedding bells.
Phoebe  Monica slow down! Ok? I'm just excited to be living with him. You
  know I mean, I don't know, Can I see someday being married to Mike? Sure! Yeah.
  Y'know..I can picture myself walking down the aisle in a wedding dress that
  highlights my breasts in an obvious yet classy way. But do I want that house
  in Connecticut...you know..near the good schools where Mike and I can send
  Sophie and Mike Junior.. Oh my god I do.
Ross  Phoebe, I had no idea you were so conventional.
Phoebe  I know! I guess I am! Oh my god! Load up the Volvo I want to be a
  soccer mom!
Mike  You ready to go?
Phoebe  Yeah! You bet roomy!
Monica  Don't you mean..groomy?
Mike  What are you talking about?
Phoebe  Oh please, these guys, we haven't even moved in yet and they have
  us picking out china patterns. (Mike seems to gag a little...and laughs nervously.
  They begin to leave. Phoebe bolts back)
Phoebe  China patterns!!!!!
[Scene  Joey's apartment. Rachel is fiddling with the drawer.]
Rachel  This is easy...Can't do this! (Moves away...and finds her sweater
  sleeve stuck to the drawer) Oh! Wow! Seriously I can't do this. (Fiddles more)
[Scene  Central Perk. Chandler sits on the couch. Joey sits at the round table]
Chandler  Hey Joe!
Joey  Hey!
Chandler  Listen er..I need to ask you a favor but you can't tell Monica anything
  about it.
Joey  I thought you didn't have secrets from Monica.
Chandler  And that would have made the official party line. (Joey nods) Monica
  and I are having a little financial trouble.
Joey  Yeah, I know.
Chandler  What? What do you mean you know?
Joey  Err... I just figured it out! You know, I mean you're not working and
  the economy is bad.
Chandler  Oh! Right.
Joey  (to himself) That's the fastest I have ever thought!
Chandler  Anyway, err... I need to borrow some money.
Joey  Oh! Sure! How much? Two thousand dollars?
Chandler  Yes! Two thousand dollars exactly! How do you know that! (Joey begins
  writing a cheque)
Joey  Err...Well I...Know how much you used to make and I know how much your
  rent is. (shrugs)
Chandler  Oh ok.
Joey  (To himself) I am on fire!
Chandler (Stands up and walks to Joey)  Listen...this is really nice. Do you...
  (sees his chequebook) Did you write a cheque to Monica for two thousand dollars?
  Did Monica borrow money from you?
Joey  Err... Kind of.
Chandler  I can't believe her! Did she tell you we were having money problems?
Joey  Oh no no no no no... It wasn't... It wasn't because of your money problems,
  it was for something for her.
Chandler  What?
Joey  Something personal.
Chandler  What would she get for herself for two thousand dollars that she
  wouldn't tell me about?
Woman  Excuse me.
Joey  Boob job.
Monica  I don't want her to get a boob job! That's crazy!
Joey  Well it's...It's not that crazy okay? Making them smaller, that would
  be crazy.
[Scene  Phoebe's apartment. Phoebe and Mike are packing stuff.]
Mike  Well hey, I wanna ask you about Monica's little "groomy" joke.
Phoebe  Oh! Alright. Well I think the reason people laugh is becuase it's
  a play on the word roomy.
Mike  I get the joke. Sophisticated as it was. Now the thing I wanna say is...
  maybe we should have talked about this before. Us living together, you're not
  expecting a proposal, right?
Phoebe  Oh no! No no! Not at all. We're just moving in right now. See where
  it goes.
Mike  Yeah well, that's the thing. For me it's as far as it can ever go.
Phoebe  What do you mean?
Mike  Look. Phoebe, I-I love you. Very much. But I never want to get married
  again.
Phoebe  Oh. Wow.
Mike  It's just my first marriage was, you know such a disaster. I kind of
  lost faith in the whole idea.
Phoebe  Was it really that bad?
Mike  At one point near the end she deliberately defecated.....
Phoebe  Ok, well that's bad. But don't you think it might be different with
  someone else? Perhaps a blonde who always uses a toilet. Except for once in
  the ocean.
Mike  Look it's not about who I would marry. And I was certain the first time
  I got married it would last forever. And I was totally wrong!
Phoebe  But it's just...
Mike  Look Phoebe, It's not about you. I just never wanna get married again.
Phoebe  Oh!
Mike  I'm sorry. Are you ok with that? Cause if not...maybe us moving in together
  isn't the best idea.
Phoebe  No! I definitely don't wanna get married. No I just wanted to make
  sure you didn't want to too. Whew! Coz you know when we move in and you start
  changing your mind there's gonna be hell to pay mister!
Mike  Trust me, I will never...
Phoebe  Yeah I get that.
[Scene  Joey's apartment. Rachel is flipping through magazines. Handyman is
  installing things. Monica enters.]
Rachel  Hi!
Monica  So you gave in and decided to call someone?
Rachel  Yeah, I don't know who I was kidding. I can barely use chopsticks.
Handyman  You're all set. (picks up his bag and starts to leave)
Rachel  Oh thank you so much. (Picks up the guy's spirit level) Oh oh wait!
  You forgot your erm...Your game. (hands it to him)
Handyman  Thanks.....
Chandler  Hey Rach! There she is...My perfectly proportioned wife.
Rachel  Don't look at me I never get his jokes.
Monica  Thank you?
Chandler  Oh no..don't thank me. Thank you. You know there's not one thing
  I would change about you? Not one single thing! And definitely not... two...
  single things.
Monica  Ok, you're being wierd. Do you want sex or did you do something bad?
Chandler  No no! I just love the way you look, I am warm, for your form.
Monica  Ok..You know the old classics you know,You look nice? They're still
  ok.
Chandler  Well yes yes... You look nice can mean that your face looks nice.
  I want to compliment your body. I mean..I wouldn't change it. At all. And more
  specifically, I wouldn't want anything to get any bigger.
Monica  Okay...
Chandler  I mean, You wouldn't want any part of me to get any bigger would
  you? Don't answer that.
Rachel  Just when you thought that dude couldn't get any wierder.
Monica  I know why do you think he was so worried about me getting bigger?
Rachel  I don't know! I mean, what brought that on?
Monica  Oh my god. We're trying to get pregnant so he's probably starting
  to freak out about the fact that my body is going to change.
Rachel  No you really think that's what it is?
Monica  You heard him! "No bigger!" "You're perfect!" "Just
  don't get any bigger!" Oh my god he sounded just like my high school wrestling
  coach. You know what? I'm going to have to talk to Chandler.
Rachel  Yeah! If you don't I will! Of course your body's gonna change. Your
  breasts are gonna get bigger, your ass is gonna get bigger, you're gonna lose
  bladder control. (she starts sobbing) God! It's just such a magical time!
[Scene Ross's apartment. Phoebe is at the door.]
Phoebe  Hi
Ross  Hey!
Phoebe  Listen, I wanted to ask you something about marriage.
Ross  Oh great now you're seeking me out to make jokes? I mean I can see for
  all hanging out but to come to my home!
Phoebe  No...I really wanted to know how you feel about it.
Ross  Why?
Phoebe  Mike doesn't ever wanna get married.
Ross  Never?
Phoebe  Never.
Ross  wow, are you still going to move in with him?
Phoebe  I want to, but I just want you to tell me that marriage isn't really
  that big a deal. You know that I won't, I won't be missing out on anything.
  That marriage stinks!
Ross  Yeah, marriage... stinks! I mean if you wanna see a man gain weight
  and a woman stop shaving? Get them married.
Phoebe  That's not how you really feel is it?
Ross  No, I'm sorry. Look I don't think that's what you wanna hear right now
  but I can't help it. I love marriage.
Phoebe  Seriously? You divorce-o?
Ross  If you have to call me name, I prefer "Ross the Divorcer".
  It's just cooler. Look, I know my marriage isn't exactly work out. But I love
  to be that committed to another person. And Carol had some good times before
  she became a lesbian... and once afterward. I'm sorry.
Phoebe  It's ok that's how you feel.
Ross  But come on! I mean living together will be great! I mean you guys have
  so much fun and you love Mike.
Phoebe  I do love Mike.
Ross  Yeah see? And you are so excited about moving in together before, and
  you know what? You should be. It's a big deal!
Phoebe  Yeah I guess you're right. Yeah thanks. This helped. Thanks.
Ross  The Divorcer, to the rescue!
Phoebe  It's not cooler.
Ross  Yeah I just hurt it.
[Scene  Joey's apartment. Joey enters carrying a tub of ice cream. He sets
  it on the table, takes off his jacket and struggles with the drawer. It cannot
  be opened.]
Joey  Rach?! (He walks over to the fridge to put it in, but it cannot be opened
  either) Rachel!!!!? (He walks to the bathroom and tries to lift the toilet
  seat cover. It won't come up.) So I can't do anything I like????
[Scene  Chandler and Monica's apartment. Chandler enters. Rachel and monica
  are seated at the table.]
Chandler  Hey Rach! Ah........ Perfection. (kisses monica) Wouldn't change
  a thing. Not a thing.
Monica  Honey?
Chandler  Yeah?
Monica  About that? Erm...I'm going to change.
Chandler  But honey you don't have to.
Monica  I'm going to get bigger!
Chandler  Honey I... I love your breasts the way they are!
Rachel  Argh. fascist
Monica  Well, my breasts are going to get bigger weather you like it or not!
  And you know what? It's not just my breasts. My ass is going to get bigger
  too.
Chandler  your ass?!?!?
Rachel  Man, don't be surprised if her hands and her feet get bigger too!
Chandler  They...do that?
Monica  It's kind of a package deal!
Chandler  God why why would you want to do that to yourself!?
Monica  I thought I was something that we both wanted!
Chandler  Alright look, if it means that much to you, a may be able to get
  on more with the big boobs. But the giant ass and the big clown feet?
Rachel  Oh my god Chandler! If you can't handle this, what are you going to
  be like in the hospital? With the blood and the screaming and the little present
  that's shooting out of her!?
Chandler  (sedated) What?
[Scene  Joey's apartment. He's prying open the drawer with a crowbar to no
  avail. Monica, Rachel and Chandler enter.]
Rachel  Joey! Why did you tell Chandler that Monica was getting a boob job?
Joey  Because she is!
Monica  Joey, Chandler knows I borrowed the money.
Joey  Mmmm hmm! For your boob job!
Monica, Rachel, Chandler  It's over/Joe!
Joey  OK so I'm out four thousand dollars and nobody's boobs are getting any
  bigger?
[Scene  Phoebe's apartment. Ross is helping with the packing, Phoebe and Mike
  are also there.]
Phoebe  Better.
Mike  Very cool.
Ross  Hey Pheebs, you know I'm i'm really glad you came to talk to me the
  other day and I hope I was a little helpful.
Phoebe  Oh yeah you were helpful! Yeah, no, thanks you.
Ross  Good, good. Yeah coz the more I thought about it, the more I realised
  I don't think marriage is neccessarily the right path for you.
Phoebe  What do you mean?
Ross  Well, I know the other day in the coffeehouse you were caught up in
  the whole soccer mom thing? but is that really you? I mean can you honestly
  picture yourself in a Volvo?
Phoebe  They are awfully boxy...
Ross  I don't know you'd be so bored with marriage. I mean it's so... normal.
Phoebe  Uh huh.
Ross  Hey hey, can I help?
Chandler  Well! We er..climbed up four flights of stairs, manueveored a narrow
  hallway, dodged a rabid pitbul... but these last three feet are where it gets
  really tricky.
Ross  You know sometimes your words... they hurt.
Joey  Hey uh, where do you guys want this?
Rachel  Yeah, seriously coz this is really heavy. (She suddenly lets go) I
  mean not for me because i'm only pretending to hold this, but for these guys.
Phoebe  Just one last time erm... the marriage thing... there's no wiggle
  room? None at all?
Mike  No but... You don't want to get married either right?
Phoebe  Right. Except that I do want to get married.
Joey  (voice strained) Couldn't have this conversation down at the truck huh?
Mike  You wanna get married?
Phoebe  Someday.
Chandler  Aaaaand....... hernia.
Phoebe  I haven't exactly had a normal life and I never really felt I was
  missing out on anything but it just feels that now it's my turn some of the
  regular stuff.
Mike  But if you wanna get married why didn't you say something before?
Phoebe  Because I just didn't know how much I wanted it. And I love you, and
  I wanted to live with you.
Mike  I want to live with you too! Let's do that!
Phoebe  But I don't think I can! it was ok to move in when I didn't know what
  was gonna happen, but I can't move in knowing that nothing is ever gonna happen.
Mike  Can we at least try living together? I mean you might change your mind
  about marriage.
Phoebe  Are you gonna change yours?
Mike  No.
Phoebe  Me neither. I think I need to be with someone who wants what I want.
Mike  But I don't want this to end.
Phoebe  I don't want it to end either.
Mike  I can't believe this is gonna end. I guess I'll have my stuff packed
  up.
Phoebe  Yeah.
Mike  Ok... so...(They hug) Goodbye.
Chandler/Joey/Rachel/Monica  Bye bye Mike!/Cya mike!/Bye mike!/Bye bye now!
Rachel  I'm so sorry Pheebs.
Monica  We're all sorry... (They have a group hug)
Chandler  Ah, look on the bright side, I mean you won't have to live with
  this ugly chair! That was here already huh? I love you. (they hug again)
[Scene  Joey's apartment. Joey is struggling with the fridge. He finally gets
  it open and falls on the floor]
Joey  AH HAH! I DID IT! HA HA! Alright... (He takes a box out, about to close
  fridge, then thinks.) Better take all I can carry. Who knows when i'll be able
  to get in here again!
[Scene  Ross' apartment , Chandler and Joey enter]
Chandler  Hey! Ready to go?
Ross  Oh yeah, let me just finish this.
Joey  Hey Ross, check this out! (he tries to spin a basketball on his fingertip but he throws it against a table) yeah, I can't do that!
Chandler  What are you doin'?
Ross  Have you seen this? It's a new alumni website for college! It's cool! You can post messages for people, let everyone know what you're up to.
Chandler  Great, a faster way to tell people that I'm unemployed and childless .
Ross  It's actually kinda interesting to find out what people are doing... remember Andrea Rich?
Chandler  The tall girl who wouldn't sleep with you?
Ross  Uh uh... well, her Internet Company went under and she lost an ear in a boating accident...
Chandler  Bet she'd sleep with you now...
Ross  No... I already e-mailed her.
Ross  You know what? I'm gonna finish this later, ok? Let me just grab my coat.
Joey  Hey! (he throws the basketball against a table again)
Ross  (he picks up the ball) What do you think you learnt how to do in the last two minutes?? (he enters another room)
Chandler  Maybe we finish this for him! (he sits down on the sofa and he start typing on Ross' computer) "Also I cloned a dinosaur in my lab. She's now my girlfriend. I don't care what society says. It's the best sex I've ever had"... aaand SEND!
Joey  (he stops Chandler from posting the message) No, no, no... what do... you can't do that to him!
Ross  (he comes back) Alright, let's go!
Joey  Dude! (he opens his arms to receive the ball from Ross' hands)
Ross  I think you made it clear you cannot be trusted with the ball inside the house!
Joey  (after Ross leaves the room) aaand SEND! (he hits the send button)
[Scene  Joey and Rachel's apartment]
Rachel  Hey! How was basketball?
Joey  Oh, it was a lot of fun right up until Chandler got a finger in the eye!
Rachel  Oh, no! Who did that?
Joey  Chandler... hey... (he goes towards his room but he stops near Emma's cot) Rach... what's Hugsy doin' in the crib with Emma? (he looks puzzled)
Rachel  She was just crawling around and she found him, so I just let her sleep with him. That's all right? Isn't it?
Joey  (still very puzzled) Oh, yeah... of course... yeah... it's a stuffed animal... you know... it's for kids... not for adults... I know that!
Rachel  Joey... are you sure? I mean, I know how much you love him!
Joey  Rachel... let's be clear on this, ok? I do not love Hugsy. I like him a normal amount...
Rachel  All right... Oh, Emma loves him!
Joey  Why wouldn't she? He's a wonderful person!
[Scene  Central Perk]
Phoebe  Hi.
Monica  Hey Phoebe... how you doin'? You feelin' better?
Phoebe  Breaking up sucks! Oh, I really miss Mike!
Chandler  Oh, I'm so sorry!
Phoebe  Oh God, I tried everything to make myself feel better. I even tried writing a song about it... but... I can't think of anything that rhymes with AARRGGHH!! (pause) Hey Monica, I really need your help getting through this...
Chandler  You're not gonna need my help?
Phoebe  Well no, when I get to the point where... you know... I'm ready to hear cruel mocking jokes about Mike... I'm gonna come to you.
Chandler  Oh good, 'cause I've already thought of 3... 4! I've just thought of a fourth (he goes towards the counter)
Phoebe  Ok. I mean I know I did the right thing. You know, Mike never wants to get married and I shouldn't be in a relationship that has no future... but... pretty soon I'm gonna miss him so much. I'm gonna wanna see him again and you have to stop me from doing that.
Monica  Ok, you got it!
Phoebe  (after a pause) Unless... Maybe it's too crazy about this... Alright so... you know, there is no future... but that doesn't mean we still can't have fun. You know what? Forget what I said.
Monica  Really? If that's what you want...
Phoebe  That was a test and you just failed.
Monica  Damn it! Rookie mistake!
Ross  (yelling at Chandler) I have sex with dinosaurs??
Chandler  I believe I read that somewhere!
Ross  That only is not funny, it's physically impossible! Ok? Depending on the species I'd have to have a six foot long...  (pause) It's not funny!!
Chandler  I respectfully disagree.
Ross  I can't believe you put that on my alumni page!
Chandler  Who cares? Nobody reads those things
Ross  You'd better hope not because I just read what you put on your page today.
Chandler  I don't have a page.
Ross  Oh oh oh! I RESPECTFULLY DISAGREE!!
[Scene  Rachel's room. Rachel and Emma are sleeping; Joey sneaks in and approaches the crib]
Joey  Look at you, all sweet and innocent, sleeping like an angel...  with Emma's chubby little hands wrapped around ya. (he picks up Hugsy) It's okay, Emma, you stay asleep. (Emma cries)
Joey  It's okay, it's okay Rach, it's me. Put down the scrunchy.
Rachel  What are you doing?
Joey  Well, I heard Emma stirring, so I came to make sure she could reach Hugsy.
Rachel  Oh, oh thanks. Alright well, now that I'm up I'm going to go to the bathroom.
Joey  (placing Hugsy back in the crib) There you go sweetie...  (to Emma) This isn't over.
[Scene  Monica and Chandler's. Chandler is looking at the screen of his laptop, shaking his head.]
Monica  Alright, wait a second, why would Ross tell everyone in your class that you are as...  (reads from the screen) "gay as the day is long"?
Chandler  Because I told everyone he slept with dinosaurs.
Monica  But that's clearly a joke. This could easily be true. (Phone rings)
Chandler  Would you get that please? People have been calling to congratulate me all day.
Monica  (On the phone) Hello? No, he's not here. Yeah, this is his wife. Yeah, well, it came as quite a shock to me too. I guess I should have known. Yeah, I mean, he just kept making me watch Moulin Rouge.
Chandler  Hang up, hang up. And that was a great movie! (Monica hangs up) I'm so gonna get back at Ross... oh yeah, this will show him, here we go (starts typing something).
Monica  What are you doing?
Chandler  Oh, you'll see my friend.
Ross  (visibly upset) I'm dead?
Chandler  (faking sympathy) And so young.
Ross  Posting that I died? That really isn't funny.
Chandler  Well, how you died was funny.
Ross  Oh please, hit by a blimp?
Chandler  It kills over one americans every year.
Ross  Unbelievable, my classmates are gonna think I'm dead, my professors, my... my parents are gonna get phone calls. You're messing with people's feelings here.
Chandler  You wanna talk about people's feelings? You should have heard how hurt professor Stern was yesterday when I told him I wouldn't be able to go with him to Key West!
Ross  You've really crossed the line here, but that's okay, it's ok 'cause I'm on my way to buy some Photoshop software and a stack of gay porn. That's right! Your coming out is about to get real graphic.
[Scene  Phoebe's apartment]
Phoebe  God, I wish Mike were here.
Monica  Okay if Mike were here what would the two of you be doing?
Monica  What are you, animals? It's 4 o'clock in the afternoon!
Phoebe  I gotta call him. Just to talk to him, there's no harm in that.
Monica  Phoebe, that's how it starts. I don't need to eat the cake, I'll just smell the icing... why don't I just eat a little sliver, or, okay, just a slice or two. And next thing you know, you're 210 pounds and you get wedged in going down the tunnel slide. Phoebe, honey, I know this is hard. Look, if you talk to him, you're going to wanna see him. And if you see him, you're going to want to get back together with him. I know that's not what you want. (pause) Give me your phone.
Phoebe  Here.
Monica  And now your cell.
Phoebe  Okay (she takes a huge, clearly obsolete cellphone she keeps in a closet and gives it to Monica)
Monica  This is your cellphone?
Phoebe  Yes.
Monica  This is your current cellphone?
Phoebe  Yes, it reminds me of a simpler time.
Monica  Phoebe, where's your purse?
Monica  No, no! Give it to me!
Phoebe  You can't have it.
Monica  Give it to me!
Phoebe  No (tucks it in her pants)
Monica  I'll go in there.
Phoebe  (disbelievingly) Oh yeah.
Monica  Phoebe come here
Monica  Haha!
Phoebe  Damn you Monica Geller hyphen Bing!
[Scene  Joey and Rachel's. Enter Joey]
Joey  Hey, look who's here! It's Joey, and he brought home a friend.
Rachel  Joey, Emma's right here! You promised not to bring girls home in the middle of the day anymore.
Joey  No, no, it's not a girl, it's...  a brand new Hugsy!
Rachel  Oh that's so great, now Emma has two Hugsy's.
Joey  No, no, Emma has one Hugsy, the new Hugsy, huh? The other Hugsy, I don't know, I guess I'll just take it back.
Rachel  Oh you know what? When I was a little girl I had a little pink pony named Cotton. Oh I loved her so much, I took her everywhere, I would braid her tail...
Joey  Make the transfer! (She does so)
Rachel  Should I be concerned that a button fell off the old Hugsy and I can't find it?
Joey  Oh, no don't worry about that, I swallowed that years ago.
Rachel  Oh, I don't think she likes the new Hugsy.
Joey  But he's the same.
Rachel  Yeah, I think she wants the old one back.
Joey  But he's the same.
Rachel  Joey, come on!
Joey  He's the same!
Joey  (to the new Hugsy) You're not the same!
[Scene  Phoebe's apartment. Enter Monica]
Monica  Haha!
Phoebe  You know, it's a lot less surprising to do that after I've buzzed you into the building.
Monica  So Phoebe, why are there men's shoes by the door.
Phoebe  Those are my shoes.
Monica  Oh, when you get over this breakup we need to go shopping.
Phoebe  Monica, I really appreciate you checking in on me, but I'm actually feeling a lot better. Yeah, I just kinda want to be alone right now.
Monica  Who's that? (goes to open door)
Phoebe  I ordered Chinese food.
Phoebe  What are the chances? 1 billion Chinese people and they send Mike!?
Monica  (To Mike) What are you doing here?
Mike  Phoebe called me.
Monica  Phoebe!
Phoebe  I'm sorry, I broke down...  I wanted to see him.
Monica  Damnit Phoebe! How did you even call him?
Phoebe  There is a speakerphone on the base unit...
Monica  Base Unit! Think Monica! Think!
Mike  Look, if I wanna see Phoebe and she wants to see...
Monica  (to Mike) This doesn't concern you!!
Mike  Oh! Sorry, I guess I was thrown off by the mention of my name!
Monica  Look, guys, you can't do this, it's just going to make getting over each other, that much harder.
Phoebe  Not if nothing happens. Why can't... why can't we just hang out as friends?
Monica  Sure! If you're just gonna hang out as friends, then maybe I'll join ya. You know, I'm your friend (to Phoebe) and Mike's friend (Mike is sceptical).
Phoebe  Sit down.
Monica  Oh wow wow wow!! Make room for your friend! (sits herself down between them)
Mike  (to Phoebe) So how've you been?
Monica  I've been pretty good!
Mike  (to Phoebe) You look really beautiful.
Phoebe  Thanks, you look good too.
Monica  Oh no no no no... this is dangerous territory. Keep it clean!
Phoebe  So how's the piano playing going?
Mike  Actually I've been playing a lot of love songs lately. I've missed you.
Phoebe  I've missed you too.
Monica  You know, on the way over here, I saw this drunk guy throw up. And then a pigeon ate it!
Chandler  Hey, Ross, I just wanted to apologize... (­looks at laptop screen)..don't tell me you actually made those gay pictures of me?
Ross  uhu uhu, check this out. (Chandler sits down and looks at laptop screen)
Chandler  Huh! So that's what I would look like if I worked out... and was being serviced by a policeman. You're not actually going to send these out are ya?
Ross  Eh..actually no, I don't need to because your little "Ross is dead" joke didn't work, ok, there were no responses. Nobody posted anything on the website, nobody called my parents, so the joke my friend is on you. Nobody called, nobody wrote anything, nobody cares that I'm dead. (silence) Oh my God! Nobody cares that I'm dead!?
Chandler  No, come on, you know that's not true.
Ross  What are you talking about? You get sixty responses just for coming out of the closet! I didn't get one response! And I'm dead!
Chandler  Well, the gay community is a lot more vocal than the dead community.
Ross  I can't believe this. Not even my geology lab partner? And I carried that guy! (gets up from his sofa)
Chandler  Alright look, let's think about this, ok, do you really think that people are gonna stir up your family at this tragic time? That people are gonna post condolences on a website? This is not about people not caring that you're dead .This is about people not having a decent outlet for their grief.
Ross  You're right. There isn't a decent outlet.
Chandler  Right, I mean, come on, I'm sure that if you had a funeral or a memorial service, tons of people would come.
Ross  Exactly!! (sits back down at his laptop and starts typing)
Chandler  Ross, what're you... what're you... what are you doing? (looks at laptop screen)You're having a memorial service for yourself!?
Ross  No! That would be stupid! You're having it for me!
Chandler  Ross, don't press send, don't press se... !
Ross  oh, too late, too late! It's sent... oops sorry and so is the picture of you and the police man...
Rachel  I'm trying to put Emma down for a nap, have you seen Hugsy?
Joey  Original or crappy?
Rachel  Original.
Joey  No, sorry haven't seen him.
Rachel  Then what's that big lump under your covers?
Joey  It's Monica, ok?
Rachel  That's not Monica!
Joey  Alright!! Fine! It's original Hugsy! No, now I know that Emma wants him but he's mine and I need him..
Rachel  (to herself) Oh God.
Joey  ... she's being unreasonable!
Rachel  (yelling) Joey, there is a reason that Emma loves that stupid penguin so much (Joey covers Hugsy's ears) Oh don't cover its ears! (stops yelling) It's because it reminds her of her uncle Joey!
Joey  It does?
Rachel  Yeah! And she's comforted by him because she loves her uncle Joey so much.
Joey  Really? She... she loves me?
Rachel  Oh yeah! But you know what? If you need Hugsy, don't worry. Emma will totally understand. I won't... but whatever (She leaves the room).
Joey  Ok, wait wait wait wait a minute wait a minute, I mean Rach, I mean if if... . If Hugsy means that much to Emma then...  well she can have him.
Rachel  Oooh... you're sweet, I knew uncle Joey would step up. (Turns to face Emma in the the playpen) Look Emma, look who's baaack!
Joey  Look forget it forget it...  I can't do it.
Rachel  Are you gonna...  you're going to take Hugsy away from a little child?
Joey  How do you think I got him in the first place?
Mike  I've missed you so much! No, I'm not gonna ask you to get back together because I know we want different things, but just to be with you one more night.
Phoebe  I know, I want that too, but IS that going to make it too hard?
Mike  It can't be any harder than this... I mean, If I had known the last time I saw you would be the last time, I... I would have stopped to memorize your face, the way you move, everything about you. If I had known the last time I kissed you would have been the last time...  I never would have stopped.
Monica  (running back into the room) Kiss him, you fool!!
Phoebe  What?
Monica  Didn't you hear that speech? If you don't kiss him then I will!
Phoebe  Oh, I missed you so much! (she kisses Mike)
Strange man  (he bounds into the house) I knew you'd be here!
Mike  Oh, crap!
Phoebe  Who is this?
Mike  My friend Manny. I asked him to keep me away from you.
Monica  Hi, that's what I'm doing for Phoebe!
Manny  Well, you are not doing a very good job!
Monica  Excuse me?
Manny  What's with the kissing?
Monica  Hey, at least I knew where my guy was.
Manny  Oh yeah yeah, thank God you were here to oversee all the kissing!
Monica  You didn't hear the speech!
Monica  Hey, it was very moving! You're just heartless!
Manny  You're weak!
Monica  You're... weird!
Manny  Your pants are undone!
Monica  Oh (realizes her pants are undone and zips them up)!
Manny  (looking at the sofa) Where did they go?
Monica  Damn it!
Manny  Oh we blew it. I blame myself.
Monica  And I blame you too.
[Scene  Monica and Chandler's apartment]
Ross  It's been an hour and not one of my classmates has shown up! I tell you, when I actually die some people are gonna get seriously haunted!
Chandler  There you go! Someone came!
Ross  Ok, ok! I'm gonna go hide! Oh, this is so exciting, my first mourner! (he hides in the bedroom and closes the door)
Monica  Hi, glad you could come.
Chandler  (in a mournful voice) Please, come in.
Tom  Hi, you're Chandler Bing, right? I'm Tom Gordon, I was in your class.
Chandler  Oh yes, yes... let me... take your coat.
Tom  Thanks... uh... I'm so sorry about Ross, it's...
Chandler  At least he died doing what he loved... watching blimps (he goes in the bedroom)
Ross  Who is he?
Chandler  Some guy, Tom Gordon.
Ross  I don't remember him, but then again I touched so many lives. (they press their ears against the door)
Monica  So, did you know Ross well?
Tom  Oh, actually I barely knew him. Yeah, I came because I heard Chandler's news. D'you know if he's seeing anyone?
Monica  (a bit surprised) Yes, he is. Me.
Tom  What? You... You... Oh! Can I ask you a personal question? Ho-how do you shave your beard so close?
Chandler  (entering, very upset) Ok Tommy, that's enough mourning for you! Here we go, bye bye!! (he shoves him out the door)
Tom  (before leaving) Hey, listen. Call me.
Chandler  Ok! (shuts the door behind Tom)
Ross  (coming in) I'm dead and no one cares?
Monica  I look like a man??
Chandler  Please, one ridiculous problem at a time!
Ross  It isn't ridiculous, look around! No one's here!
Chandler  You gave them one day's notice, not everyone in our class checks the web site everyday and Monica... it's probably the way you stand!
Ross  Yes, you're right. Still somebody must have seen it... I mean, I went to that school for 4 years, I didn't have an impact on anyone?
Chandler  Oh, that's not true. You had an impact on me, I mean, it's 15 years later and we're still best friends. Doesn't that count for something?
Ross  (sceptical) Yeah...
Chandler  I'm sure it's somebody for you. Now, go hide. (Ross hides in the bedroom again)
Kori  Hi. I'm here for Ross Geller's memorial service.
Chandler  Kori? Kori Weston?
Kori  Yeah...
Chandler  Wow! You look amazing!
Kori  And you are...
Chandler  Chandler, Chandler Bing. I'm not gay, I'm not gay at all.
Monica  You are married though.
Chandler  Don't listen to him, he's in a really bad mood! (lets her in)
Kori  I can't believe that Ross is gone. It is just so sad.
Chandler  I didn't know Ross and you were so close.
Kori  We weren't but we had one class together. He was such a great guy and he talked so passionately about science. I always remembered him.
Chandler  I'm sure that would mean a lot to him. And if heaven has a door, I'm sure he's pressing his ear up against it and listening intently.
Kori  I thought so many times about calling him and asking him out. I guess I really missed my chance.
Ross  (he bounds into the lounge room) But you didn't! I'm still alive!! Kori, I know this is a big surprise for you. It's a long story but the things you just said really made my day! I mean, the fact that you are here means more to me than if this room were filled with people!
Kori  You sick freak, who does that? I can't believe I had a crush on you! (she leaves and slams the door behind her)
Ross  Did you hear that? Kori Weston had a crush on me!!
[Scene  Ross' apartment]
Ross  (on the phone) No Mum, I'm not dead. I know it's not something to kid about. It was just a practical joke between Chandler and me, but it's over, ok? (pause) Actually no, even if I had died, you would not be left childless. (pause) Monica?
[Scene  Central Perk - Chandler, Monica, Phoebe, Ross
and Rachel are sitting on the sofas. Joey enters]
Joey  Monica, hey, can I borrow the Porsche?
Monica  Ok.
Joey  Alright!
Monica  But ehm...what is it not?
Joey  (abashed) A place to entertain my lady friends.
Monica  And what else is it not?
Joey  (even more abashed) A place to eat spaghetti.
Monica  Very good! (Gives him the keys) What do you need it
for anyway?
Joey  Oh well, the powerball lottery is upto 300 million and
they don't sell tickets here in New York, so...
Rachel  Oh! So you're driving up to Connecticut?
Joey  (hesitates for a moment)Yeah Connecticut...Not West
Virginia.
Monica  Hey, maybe I'll drive you up there! I'd like to buy
some tickets myself!
Joey  Uh!
Monica  Yeah with Chandler not getting paid, we could really
use 300 million dollars.
Chandler  Yeah, because if I was at my old job we'd say 300
million? No thank you!
Phoebe  Hey will you get me tickets too?
Rachel  Yeah me too. oh! I have an idea. Why don't we all
pitch in 50 bucks, we'll pool our money together and then if we win,
we'll split it!
Everyone almost simultaneously except Ross  yeah thats a great
idea!
Ross  No thanks!
Phoebe  You don't wanna win the lottery?
Ross  (in a  mocking voice)Uh...sure I do, and I also wanna
be King of my own country and find out what happened to Amelia Earhart.
Chandler  Still on Amelia Earhart?
Ross  The woman just vanished!
Joey  Seriously, Ross, you don't want in on this?
Ross  No! Do you know what your odds are of winning the
lottery? I...I mean you have a better chance of being struck by
lightning 42 times.
Chandler  Yes but there's six of us so we'd only have to get
struck by lightning 7 times.
Joey  I like those odds!
Ross  Seriously you guys, I can't believe you're going to
spend 250 dollars on the lottery, I mean that's such a bunch of boohaki.
Chandler  (looking around at the others)I'll ask. (To Ross)
Boohaki?
Ross  Oh oh, we think Emma is about to start talking so we're
trying to be careful about what words we use in front of her.
Rachel  Yeah so get ready to hear alot of ehm...boohaki,
goshdarnit and brotherpucker.
Monica  How do you know she's gonna start talking?
Rachel  Well when I talk to her I almost feel like she
understands what I'm saying.
Chandler  Kinda like Joey.
Joey  (who wasn't paying attention)What's that now?
[Scene  Monica and Chandler's apartment. Monica,
Chandler, Rachel and Joey are in the kitchen]
Monica  God! Look at all these tickets! It's so exciting! You
know I haven't won anything since the sixth grade.
Chandler  Pie eating contest?
Monica  Oh! You assume because I was heavy that's the only way
I could win something?
Chandler  No, I saw a picture of you covered in blueberries.
Monica  (smiling)That was a good day!
Ross  (yelling to Monica)They're towing your car, they're
towing your car!!
Monica  I'm parked in a garage on Morton!
Ross  (panting)They're towing a car. And I am seeing...spots.
Joey  (sounding panicky)Oh my god Ross! You don't have Emma!
And Rachel you don't have Emma! (Starts yelling) Where's Emma? Who has
Emma!?
Rachel  Joey relax! My mother picked her up two hours ago. You
were there!
Joey  (not yelling anymore)I was?
Racel  Yes and you talked to her...
Joey  I did?
Rachel  She dropped off a casserole?
Joey  Oh yeah! The casserole lady.
Monica  (to Ross)So, did you come by to watch us win the big
bucks?
Ross  Yeah, uh... and then I figured after you win, we could
all go out to the balcony and see a night rainbow with gremlins dancing
on top of it!
Chandler  (hysterical)Don't touch the phone! I'll get it, I'll
get it, I'll get it!! (picks up the phone)
Ross  (to Monica)Think he washed his hands?
Chandler  (into receiver)Hello? Hey Charlie, what do you know?
Rachel  (to Monica)What's going on?
Monica  Chandler is supposed to find out if he's getting an
assistent job at his ad agency. But out of the 15 interns, they are
only hiring three.
Joey  Ooh! Tough odds!
Ross  (mockingly)Yeah if only it were a sure thing like your
24 state lottery!
Joey  (smiling)Look who's coming around!
Chandler  (still on the phone)Damnit. Alright call me when
you know more.
Joey  (excited)Did you get it?
Chandler  One of the slots got filled.
Joey  (Still excited)By you!?
Chandler  Sense the tone! No that kid Nate got it.
Monica  Oh! I hate that guy! I mean come on kid! Pull up your
pants!
Chandler  Yeah I know.
Rachel  Well, there's two spots left right?
Chandler  Yeah...I mean I want this so much! I mean, I wanna
get one, I want my friend Charlie to get one...Except I don't care
about Charlie.
Phoebe  (excited)Hey you guys! Ok, you're not going to
believe this! I just saw my psychic and she said I was definitely gonna
win the lottery tonight!
Monica  Hey that reminds me, I thought we could use some extra
luck so I brought a wishbone home from work.
Ross  (mockingly)A psychic AND a wishbone? Guys! Give someone
else a chance!
Monica  Alright, who wants to do it?
Phoebe  Oh can I? Vegetarians never get to do the wishbone.
It's really not fair either! You know, just because we don't eat the
meat doesn't mean we don't like to play with the carcasses!
Monica  Ok, hey Rach?
Rachel  Oh no, I'm good, I don't wanna get that turkey smell
all over my hands.
Joey  I'll do it!! It'll get the casserole stink off of mine.
Phoebe  I hope I win!
Monica  Well, it doesn't really matter ... you're both wishing
for the same thing, right?
Joey  I can't tell you what I'm wishing for! Else...you
know...won't come true!
Monica  Right! .. but we "know" what you're wishing for!
Joey  Can't really say!
Monica  I understand, but you're wishing for what we think
you're wishing for, aren't you?
Joey  (slightly irritated)I'm not really comfortable with
these questions!
Rachel, Chandler and Monica  Please, just do it!
Phoebe  One, two, three!
Joey  I won, hey!
Ross  You know what, I'm sure your wish is gonna come true,
but, you guys - just in case, maybe a genie will come out if we rub
this lamp! (rubs lamp, stops because it's very hot) Ah!! That thing
gets hot!!
Rachel  You know, Ross, just keep making your jokes. How are
you gonna feel if we actually do win?
Ross  Uh, you're not gonna win.
Rachel  Oh, I know, I know, the odds are against us, but
somebody has to win, and it could be us! And then how you gonna feel?
You know, we're gonna be all like "oh everybody, let's take our
helicopters up to the cape" and you're gonna be all like "oh, I can't
guys, I'll meet you guys up there, I gotta gas up the Hyundai"
Ross  Ok, I've heard myself on tape and I sound nothing like
that.
Ross  Why would I eat my own arm?
Chandler  Well you wouldn't, but we own the paper, we can
print whatever we want.
Monica  You know what, Ross? I'm gonna throw in 50 bucks for
you.
Ross  Why?
Monica  Because I know that you think the lottery is "boohaki"
but we're all here and gonna watch the numbers and have fun. And you're
my brother, and I want you to be a part of this.
Ross  You don't have to do that, I'll pay for myself. But just
the fact that you want me to have fun with you guys - that's so sweet!
Come here (they kiss and hug)
Phoebe  Get a room!
Chandler  Ok, so now that you're in, what are you gonna do if
we win?
Ross  I don't know, probably just invest it.
Chandler  Ooh! Calm down ...
Joey  Seriously, that's your fantasy? To invest it?
Ross  Oh, I'm sorry, did I say "invest it"? I meant "be cool
and piss it all away" (Joey and Chandler pleased)
Joey  Ooh, ooh, I know! We should pool all own money and buy
the Knicks!
Rachel  I don't really care about the Knicks.
Joey  Oh, you will when I pick you as starting forward.
Rachel  (touched) You would do that? I never get picked!
Chandler  You know, I'm not sure a sports team is the way to
go.
Joey  You're not gonna let me buy the Knicks?? I can't believe
you're taking this away from me!
Chandler  You're right, it has been you dream for over 15
seconds.
Ross  (to Rachel) Uh, how long until they announce the
numbers, Mommy?
Chandler  (looks around) I'll take this one too (to Ross) Uh
... Mommy?
Ross  Oh, I've gotten into the habit of calling Rachel "Mommy"
when we're around Emma. Which I now realize we are not ...
Rachel  I'm hoping that if she hears it enough it will be her
first word.
Ross  Although if we're gonna do that, we should probably call
me "Daddy" too.
Phoebe  Oooh, I like that, "daddy" (in a sexy tone)
Ross  I ... I was just talking about Rachel.
Phoebe  (still in sexy tone) Oooh, is daddy getting angry? Is
daddy gonna spank me?
Ross  (tries to be sexy too) Well that depends ... have you
been a baaad gi .. (stops) no I can't.
Chandler  Hello? Hello? Oh, hey Charlie. Did anybody else
hear? ... What? Susan got it?? How? Oh man, I would have slept with
him!! .. Alright, bye. (hangs up)
Joey  Dude, I'm sorry. But hey, there's one spot left, right?
Chandler  Well no, Charlie's gonna get that.
Monica  Hey, don't say that! You got just as good a chance as
anybody else of getting that job!
Chandler  He's the boss's son.
Monica  Come on, lottery!! (everybody cheers)
Rachel  Ooh, you guys, it starts in like 20 minutes.
Rachel  Ooh, I have another idea!
Monica  I'm sorry, idea time is over.
Phoebe  Ok, well, are all the tickets in the bowl?
Monica  Yeah.
Chandler  What about the ones you have on the nightstand?
Monica  There are no tickets on the nightstand!
Chandler  Yes there are, I just saw them a few minutes ago.
Monica  Un, no you didn't! You must be mistaken!
Chandler  Honey, there are like 20 tickets on the nightstand!
Monica  Chandler, sense the tone!!
Rachel  Well, well, well, look what mommy found!!
Monica  Ok, fine!! I bought 20 extra tickets for me and
Chandler.
Phoebe  Uh! The psychic also said that I would be betrayed.
Ross  I can't believe this, I thought we were all in this
together!
Monica  Hey, you just got in 5 minutes ago!
Ross  3 minutes ago!!! I don't know why that's important ...
Joey  I was with you the whole time we were in Connecticut,
when did you even get those?
Monica  When you were reading the dirty magazines without
taking off the plastic!
Joey  (to Ross) I'll show you how.
Rachel  Ok, well Monica, suppose one of your "special" tickets
win? How are you gonna feel when you win the lottery and you lose all
your friends?
Monica  Please ... if I win the lottery, you guys are not
gonna leave me. Someone gave me a basket of mini-muffins last week and
I couldn't get rid of you for 3 days!
Rachel  Chandler, would you just tell her what she did was
wrong?
Chandler  (to Mon) She's right, you shouldn't have bought
tickets just for us ...
Monica  Ahhh!  (shocked)
Chandler  Let me finish ... (to everyone else) however, it
doesn't look like I'm gonna get this job so I can't afford to have
principles, so screw you, the tickets are ours!! (takes tickets from
Rachel)
Monica  There's the man I married!!
Rachel  All right, believe me.If you win the lottery, it's
the last you're gonna hear from us!
Monica  Fine! Don't be my friends! I'll buy new friends!
Yeah, and then I'll pay for their plastic surgery so they'd look just
like you!
Rachel  (surprised) OH! Alright, you know what? That's it! I
want my share of the tickets (picks up the bowl)!
Joey  Yeah, I want my tickets too (takes the bowl from
Rachel)! And I'm buying the Knicks! And Steffi Graff, ah ah!
Ross  Than I want mine, too (takes the bowl from Joey)! And
if I win I'm gonna put it all into a very low-yield bond.
Phoebe  Oh, you guys! We've got to keep all the tickets
together (takes the bowl from Ross and puts it on the table)
Monica  No, no! We should divide them up (picks up the bowl)
and I should get extra because we used my card to buy them!
Joey  Hey, if anybody gets extra tickets, it should be me!
This all thing was my idea! (takes the bowl from Monica)
Chandler  Oh, yeah! Thanks for inventing the lottery!
Rachel  Ok, that's it! Just give'em to me! I'll split them
up! (she tries to snatch the bowl from Joey's hands but she can't, so
she pinches his nipple and she manages to take it)
Joey  (in pain) Oh!
Phoebe  (she takes the bowl from Rachel's hands and she
starts running around the room and yelling) OOOOOHHHHH!
Ross  (trying to stop her) Hey, hey!!
Phoebe  (keeping on running and yelling) OOOOOHHHHH! (she
stops) Fine, I can't take it anymore! I'm putting an end to this! (she
goes out to the balcony)
Rachel  Oh, if she jumps, I get her tickets.
Joey  No, no! (they all go towards the balcony but they get
jammed in the window)
Phoebe  If we are not doing it together, we're not doing it
at all! So, say goodbye to your tickets! (She holds out the bowl, and
makes as to drop the tickets on the street).
Everyone  NO!!
Phoebe  Don't come any closer!
Chandler  Can I come a little bit closer, valuable things are
getting squished...
Phoebe  No, what's more important, your friends or money?
Everyone but Monica  Friends!
Monica  Money! (they all look at her) Friends...
Phoebe  Hey Monica, what about your extra tickets?
Monica  They're all in there! Even these five that I hid in
my bra (takes some tickets out of her bra and gives them to Phoebe)...
Ross  Monica!
Phoebe  Ok, good! (pause) You guys were so scared! There was
no way I was gonna dump this...(a pigeon swoops down, scaring Phoebe
who drops the bowl on the street) Oh God, no! (pause) I think I broke
your bowl.
Ross  Go, go, go!!
[Scene  Monica and Chandler's apartment.]
Phoebe  What a beautiful night to be running around the
street, looking for tickets. And the wind sure made it fun.
Monica  Phoebe, we lost half of them.
Phoebe  So, what? Monica, we have the winning ticket! My
psychic said I  was gonna win, remember?
Ross  Weird.. your psychic didn't mention anything about the
scary pigeon...
Phoebe  As a matter of fact she said that's how I am going to
die. (pause ) So, excuse me for being a little skittish.
Chandler  (looking at the answering machine) Hey, there's two
messages. These could be from work!
Monica  Oh, play them!
Chandler  Ok, here we go! (he pushes the play button)
Message  (Phoebe's voice) "Hello. Th-this is the pigeon from
the balcony calling to apologise" (they all turns to look at Phoebe) "I
sh.. I shouldn't have knocked the tickets out of the pretty lady's
hand. It-it was all my fault. Not hers. Bye. Coo."
Phoebe  Well, I bet that was very hard for him to do.
Second message  "Hey Chandler, it's Charlie"
Chandler  This is..shhh!
Second Message  "Listen, oh... it turns I got the last spot.
I'm really sorry man, it was a lot of fun working with you. Give me a
call if you want."
Monica  Oh God, I am so sorry honey...
All  Oh, so sorry man! Sorry!
Rachel  Oh, it is so unfair. It's like that time they
promoted Sandra over me at work.
Chandler  Oh, is she related to Ralph Lauren?
Rachel  No, she was just much better at job than me!
Phoebe  Guys, the drawing is about to start!
Rachel  (To Ross) You know what? We should call my mum's
house and say goodnight to Emma before she goes down.
Ross  Oh yeah, it's a good idea!
Monica  (she hugs Chandler) Honey, you've been really strong
about this, I know how badly you wanted that job.
Chandler  Yeah, you know, I really thought I deserved it.
(pause) But... let's go win the lottery... I mean, we still have 130
chances to win, right?
Monica  (she draws out a ticket from a pocket of her pants)
131! (they kiss)
Ross  (on the phone) Goodnight sweetheart! I love you. And
remember, you're daddy's little girl... (covering the phone, to Rachel)
Phoebe's totally ruined that for me... (he passes the receiver to
Rachel)
Rachel  Hi mum, put her back on!
Joey  (sitting on the sofa in front of the tv) Rach, come on!
They are announcing the numbers! My God, I can already feel myself
changing.
TV  "Here we are, the official Powerball numbers! We have 53"
Chandler  I got that!
Ross  Oh, we have one too!!
Monica  We are on a roll, people!!
Ross  (calling Rachel) Come on!!
Rachel  (on the phone) Mum, please!I know you love your new
lips, but I can barely understand you! Would you, please, just let me
say goodnight to my daughter?
TV  "And number 29! Here we go! The Powerball is 7"
Monica  Check your numbers! Make me rich!
Rachel  (she goes towards the others and she's very excited)
Guys, you're not gonna believe this! I was just saying goodnight to
Emma and she said her first words!!
All  Wow!
Joey  And what did she say?
Rachel  She said "gleba"!! (she celebrates)
Monica  Make me rich!!
Rachel  (to Ross) Isn't that amazing?
Ross  Oh yeah, no no no...that's great!
Rachel  Why-why aren't you more excited?
Ross  Oh, Rach...oh..."gleba" is not a word.
Rachel  Oh, but of course it is!
Ross  Okay, what does it mean?
Rachel  I don't know all the words.
Ross  I'm just, I'm just glad I didn't miss my daughter's
first words (goes back to checking the tickets).
Ross  Yes you did, gleba is a word!
Ross  Ok, use it in a sentence.
Rachel  Ok... "Emma just said gleba"!
Ross  It's not a word!
Rachel  Okay, okay, okay, fine, I'm gonna look it up (she goes
and picks up the dictionary).
Ross  She's gonna be a scientist! (kisses Rachel on the head,
very moved)
Joey  (checking the last ticket) Damnit! anybody got anything?
Chandler  No.
Phoebe  I'm still looking through mine...
Monica  Just double checking (does so)...no, no, no...(takes off a shoe and takes a ticket out of it) No!
Monica  (answering phone) Hello? Hold on. It's your boss.
Chandler  Ah, the "I'm sorry I rejected you" phone call. I'm
not used to getting it from guys. (on the phone, getting up from the
sofa) Hey, Steve.
Steve  Chandler, hi! I'm sure you've heard we filled the three
positions. We just felt that with your maturity and experience, you
wouldn't be happy being someone's assistant.
Chandler  Oh no no no no, I'd love to be somebody's assistant!
Answering phones, getting coffee, I live for that stuff! And I'm not
too mature... farts, boobies, butt cracks!
Steve  Chandler, you were the strongest person in the program.
We're offering you the position of junior copywriter.
Chandler  Me, that guy who just said butt cracks?
Steve  Yes, that's right. We're excited about the level of
sophistication you'll be bringing to the job.
Chandler  Ok well, thanks, you won't regret it. I'll see you
tomorrow (hangs up).
Chandler  What? (pause) Oh, yeah, I'm gonna be a junior
copywriter.
Everybody  (excited) Oh my God, congratulations!
Monica  Oh sweetie, I'm so proud of you!
Chandler  Does that mean I get the good loving tonight?
Monica  You bet! No TV or anything! (she gets up from the sofa
and goes to the kitchen area)
Joey  (to Chandler) Hey, that is so great about the job.
Chandler  Thanks, man.
Joey  And I like to think I had a little something to do with
it.
Chandler  Really? What?
Joey  Well, before, with the wishbone... I didn't wish we
would win the lottery, I wished you'd get the job.
Chandler  (smiling, surprised) Oh yeah? (looks towards the
kitchen, worried) Listen, don't tell Monica, she'll rip your heart
right out.
Joey  Oh yeah.
Rachel  You know what? There is a little part of me that
really thought we were gonna win.
Ross  Me too. So much for my dinosaur/Amelia Earhart theme
park.
Phoebe  You guys, what was the Powerball number again?
Monica and Ross  Seven.
Phoebe  We won.
Rachel  What?
Phoebe  We won!
Monica  Let me see!
Phoebe  Don't tear it.
Ross  Phoebe, you don't have any of the first five numbers.
Phoebe  I know that, but look, we've got the Powerball number,
we've won 3 dollars!
Chandler  Wow, you'd think we should get that over 20 years or
go for the big payout.
Phoebe  (still very excited) I don't care, I've never won
anything before, I can't believe this!
Rachel  So Pheebs, what are you going to do with your $3?
Phoebe  It's not all mine. We all get 50 cents.
Monica  You know what? You can have mine.
Chandler  Me too.
Joey  Me too.
Rachel  Me too.
Ross  I guess if everybody else is...
[Scene  Central Perk. They're all sitting there as
usual, except Joey. Gunther is serving a nearby table.]
Joey  (sitting in a chair) Hey guys, so I just called the
Powerball hotline, can you believe it? Nobody won.
Phoebe  I beg to differ (shows him her cup of coffee and her
plate of cookies).
Gunther  Maybe nobody won the jackpot, but there was this guy
in here earlier, and he found the ticket on the street, right outside,
and won $10,000 (goes to the counter).
Phoebe  (hides her mouth behind the cup and speaks in the
"pigeon voice" from before) Coo, again. Don't blame the pretty lady. It
was not her fault. It was me, the pigeon, coo! (pause) Seriously, stop
staring at her.
[Scene  Rachel and Joey's apartment]
Joey  (talking to a pineapple in his hand) God, you're beautiful...why are we fighting this?You know you want it to happen as much as I do.
Joey  I want you.I need you.Let me make love to you.
Rachel  I don't wanna stand in the way of true love or anything, but I think a 
cantaloupe might hurt less.
Joey  Oh, ehm...I'm...I'm rehearsing my lines.They gave me a big romantic story on Days Of Our Lives. It's the first time my character's got one. I'm so nervous, you know, I really want it to be good!
Rachel  Woow!I haven't seen you this worked up since you did that dog food commercial and you thought you were gonna be with a real talking dog!
Joey  Yeah, that was a disappointment...(pause) Oh, hey!D'you want to come down to the set and tell me if I'm doing ok?
Rachel  (excited) Are you serious?
Joey  Yeah!Hey, you just have to promise not to get yourself thrown out again.
Rachel  Hey, that was an honest mistake!
Joey  Right!(he starts to ape her)"Oh my God, is this the men's room? Oh, I feel so foolish, have you always known you wanted to be an actor?" (he inclines his head as if to look at a man's private parts)
Rachel  Yeah, that was an awesome day!
[Scene  Central Perk]
Monica  Hey!
Phoebe  Hey!
Ross  Hi!
Monica  So, do you guys wanna come and eat dinner at the restaurant sometime in the next few weeks?
Phoebe  Sure!
Ross  I'd love to!
Monica  Well you can't! We're booked solid for the next month!
Phoebe  Well, I can't give you a massage, because my licence has been revoked again!
Ross  Phoebe, what happened?
Phoebe  Well, it was an accident...You know, it's a lot of oil and sometimes the hand just slips!
Chandler  (To Monica) Have I got a surprise for you? Pack your bags!
Phoebe  Oh no!You guys aren't supposed to get divorced for 7 years!
Chandler  What? No, I'm taking Monica to a romantic inn in Vermont (shows them a brochure)!
Phoebe  Oh, good!Ok, good for you!Try to recapture the magic!
Chandler  So, what do you say? Can you get out of work?
Monica  Oh, honey!I can't. I was just telling these guys that things are crazy at the restaurant!
Chandler  Are you really that busy?
Monica  Yeah, I'm sorry. I really am.
Chandler  Oh, that's ok.I'll just try and reschedule. (on the phone) "Hi, this is Chandler Bing. I made a reservation there and I need to change it (pause) Oh, what do you mean it's not refundable? Can I just come some other time? (pause) Oh, can't you make an exception?"
Monica  Tell them I'm a chef in a big New York restaurant!
Phoebe  And tell them that in 2 weeks I will once again be a masseuse in good standing!
Chandler  (on the phone) "Look, this is ridiculous! I'm not paying for that room! Ok?" (pause) "Oh, thank you very much!" (hangs up) Yeah, I'm going to Vermont...
Ross  Oh, don't worry about it! Just use your travel insurance.
Chandler  I don't have travel insurance.
Ross  Well, this is what happens when people live on the edge!
Monica  Why don't you take Ross?
Ross  Uh, don't you think that would be a little weird? I mean, two guys in a romantic inn...
Monica  No, not if their room has two beds!
Ross  (browsing the brochure) I guess...It still seems a little...(enthusiastically) moonlight boat ride!!
[Scene  Days of Our Lives' Studios]
Rachel  Hey Joey, is this the bed where Olivia lost her virginity?
Joey  I don't know, but one of the extras sure did! (pause) Hey, listen Rach. Thanks again for coming down to watch my scenes!
Rachel  Oh, please!Honey, just the fact that you want me here to support you, I'm...OH MY GOD!Is that Christian Sanders?He's so gorgeous!
Joey  Also so gay!
Rachel  Oh, in my head he's done some pretty "not-gay-stuff"!
Joey  Well, at the Christmas party him and Santa did some definitely gay stuff!
Director  Joey, Joey! We're ready for you!
Joey  Oh, wish me luck!
Rachel  Ok, not that you need it but good...GOD!Is that Chase Lassiter?He's straight, right?
Joey  Rach, I gotta say...if you weren't here wondering if these guys were gay I don't know if I could do this!
Rachel  Oh, I'm sorry, you're right.I'm sorry, good luck! (they hug)
Director  On a bell please! Quietly.. and ACTION!
Actress/Olivia  Drake! What are you doing in here?
Joey/Drake  Stopping you from marrying the wrong man and making the biggest mistake of your life.
Actress/Olivia  Get out!
Joey/Drake  You don't love him!
Actress/Olivia  What do you know about love?
Joey/Drake  I know what I felt that night when we kissed under the bridge.
Actress/Olivia  That kiss never happened.
Joey/Drake  Oh, what about this one.
Rachel  (watching a television where the scene is shown, startled) OH!
Actress/Olivia  No, I told you...get out!
Joey/Drake  Fine. I'll go. But let me ask you one question...
Chase Lassiter  (talking to Rachel) You look familiar, have we...
Rachel  SSSHHHHTTT!!He's asking her a question!!
Joey/Drake  Can you really live the rest of your life never knowing what we could have been?
Actress/Olivia  I don't have a choice...
Joey/Drake  Yes, you do.Yes...you do. I'm the one who doesn't have a choice because I...because I can't stop loving you.
Actress/Olivia  Don't say that...
Joey/Drake  Tell me to stop, just...tell me to stop. (he's about to kiss her)
Director  CUT!
Rachel  NO! (pause) Or, cut!You know, that's your call!
[Scene  Monica's restaurant]
1st Customer  Everything was delicious!
Monica  Thank you!
2nd Customer  It was. The duck in particular was superb.
Monica  Thank you!(she looks at the 3rd customer waiting for a compliment) You haven't said anything...
3rd Customer  Actually I do have one small complaint.
Monica  Oh..please!I-I welcome criticism.
3rd Customer  The musician right outside the restaurant...it's kind of a mood-killer!
Monica  What musician?
[Scene  Outside the restaurant]
Phoebe  (playing guitar and singing) And there's a country called Argentinaaaa, it's a place I've never seeeeen. But I'm told for fifty pesos you can buy a human spleen. Humaaan spleeeeen. Olè!
Monica  What are you doing here!
Phoebe  Well, you said that you had customers lined up in the street, so I am here to entertain!
Monica  Great!
Phoebe  Yeah! It really has been great too, you know, some of this people must have seen me play before because they were requesting a bunch of my songs! Yeah, "You suck" and "shut up and go home".
Monica  Listen Phoebe...
Phoebe  Yeah.
Monica  You know how much I love listening to your music, you know, but...
Phoebe  But what?
Monica  This is kind of a classy place.
Phoebe  (pause) Ok, say no more.
[Time lapse  Phoebe in front of restaurant again]
[Scene  hall of the romantic inn in Vermont]
Chandler  Hi, Chandler Bing, I have a reservation.
Receptionist  Welcome to the Chestnut Inn Mr. Bing, so where are you joining from?
Chandler  New York.
Ross  (in a strange voice and eating candies) The big apple!
Chandler  I'm sorry, he's a little bit wound up, we had to stop at every maple candy stand on the way here.
Ross  Yeah, I ate all my gifts for everybody.
Receptionist  I am sorry Mr. Bing, there's no record of your reservation in the computer.
Chandler  Well, that's impossible, can you check again, please?
Ross  (high pitched voice) Check again please!
Receptionist  I'm sorry, it's not here.
Ross  Not there.
Chandler  Let me get this straight. I called yesterday trying to cancel my reservation and I was told it was not refundable, then we drove six hours all the way up here and now you tell me that we don't have a reservation?
Receptionist  I don't know what to say.
Ross  (mumbling) She doesn't know what to say!
Chandler  Just give us the cheapest room you have.
Receptionist  Unfortunatly the only thing we have available is our deluxe suite, the rate is six hundred dollars.
Chandler  That's insane!
Ross  Totally insane. Dude, let's drive home, we'll hit all the maple candy stores on the way back and if...if they're closed maybe we'll tap a tree and make some ourselves.
Chandler  Does that room have a closet I can lock him in? (pause) We'll take it.
Receptionist  Great.
Chandler  (aside, to Ross) What!? They are totally ripping us off!
Ross  Dude, don't worry 'bout it! I know how we can make your money back! This is a nice hotel, you know, plenty of amenities, we just load up on those! Like those apples. Instead of taking one, I'm... I take six!
Chandler  Great, at a hundred dollars an apple, we're there!
Ross  C'mon, you get the idea, ow-ow-ow we'll make our money back in no time!
Chandler  Dude, you're shaking!
Ross  I think it's the sugar, could you hold the apple?
[Scene  Joey's apartment]
Rachel  Hi!
Joey  Hey!
Rachel  Joey, I gotta tell ya, I've been thinking all day about that scene you did, I mean, you were amazing!
Joey  Oh, you know, the writing was good, and the director is good, and... and my co-star's good but they're not as good as me!
Rachel  God, you have to tell me what happens tomorrow!
Joey  Ow, I'm just going over the script now! You wanna read lines with me?
Rachel  Me? Oh, no, I am not an actress.
Joey  Oh, all right, I can ask Monica.
Rachel  Oh screw her, that part is mine!
Joey  Right... (pause) ok, so just from the top of the page, right here.
Rachel  Okay. (pause).(acting) Hello Drake, I'm surprised to see you here.
Joey/Drake  I can't believe you married him.
Rachel/actress  But what choice did I have. He was keeping my sister in a dungeon!
Joey/Drake  So what about us? Everything we feel for each other.
Rachel/actress  It's over! You have to accept that.
Joey/Drake  How can I? Knowing I'll never hold you in my arms again, or touch your skin, or feel your lips, knowing I'll never make love to you? How can I accept that... I can never kiss you again when it's all I can do not to kiss you right now.
Rachel  (pause) Kiss me.
Joey  What?
Rachel  Kiss me.
Joey  Ah, Rach, it doesn't say that!
Rachel  No, I'm saying...
Joey  but, but..
Rachel  just... don't talk... (she kisses him)
[Scene  Rachel's bedroom]
Rachel  (waking up) Ehhh, aw! (pause). Well, that's new!
[Scene  Hotel's room]
Ross  (on the phone) Hi, this is Ross Geller in suite 206. It seems you forgot a couple of things. Could you have some complimentary toiletries sent up to my room? (pause) Thank you! Ok. Toothbrush, toothpaste, razor, mouthwash, deodorant, dental floss, band aids, shaving cream, after shave... and I feel like I am forgetting something... Is there anything else you have that I haven't asked for already? (pause) Yeah, go ahead, send up some tampons.
Ross  What did you get?
Chandler  USA Today
Ross  Nice, put it with the others.
Chandler  And I also got... two more apples.
Ross  We are four short of a bush-o (pause). God I feel so alive, I love being in the country!
Chandler  I also got this great salt and pepper shaker from the restaurant.
Ross  Oh, that's not cool.
Chandlers  Dude, none of this is cool.
Chandler  I think I know what you mean though...the lamp is the hotel's, but the bulbs (goes to take the bulb)...oh, you already got that.
Ross  Not my first time in a hotel, my friend.
Chandler  Ok, how about this (picks up the remote control)?
Ross  No, no, no, you can't take the remote control!
Chandler  Yes, but the batteries...
Chandler  Thank you, thank you very much!
Ross  Let's celebrate with some maple candy!
Chandler  No!
Ross  At least tell me where you hid it.
[Scene  Central Perk. Monica and Rachel are sitting on the sofa]
Rachel  Can I ask you a question?
Monica  Yeah.
Rachel  Have you ever had any weird romantic dreams?
Monica  Let me think. Oh, when I was younger I used to dream that I got married to Mayor McCheese, and on our wedding night I ate his head.
Rachel  Ok, well this is like that...in no way. I had a...I had a dream last night that I wanted to kiss Joey.
Monica  Wow, do you mean like kiss him-kiss him?
Rachel  Oh yeah! I mean, that was pretty intense.
Monica  What do you think brought than on?
Rachel  I don't know! I mean, maybe that's something to do with the fact that I saw him do a love scene yesterday.
Monica  A love scene? With who?
Rachel  Olivia.
Monica  Olivia? I thought she was marrying Connor! (pause) Oh right, real life more important.
Rachel  So do you think that my dream means anything?
Monica  I don't know. I mean, you saw him do a love scene, so maybe you don't have a thing for Joey, maybe you have a thing for Drake.
Rachel  Ah! Well it was Joey reading Drake's lines in the dream...
Monica  Of course it was! Trust me, when it comes to psychology I know what I'm talking about. I took two psych classes in college.
Rachel  You took the same class twice.
Monica  It was hard!
Phoebe  Hey!
Rachel and Monica  Hi.
Phoebe  Here, Monica, look what I got to wear when I play at the restaurant (she dons a top hat) uh, huh wait! (she raises a pair of spectacles to her eyes) Right? I mean, this might even class up the ballad of the uncircumcised man.
Monica  Oh...Phoebe? Maybe I wasn't clear before. I really love listening to your music here, but my restaurant is sort of an upscale place.
Phoebe  Right, yeah, ok, I'll ask the butler to fetch my diamonds out of the vault.
Monica  Phoebe, it's not what you wear. It's sort of your songs... I just don't think you should play at the restaurant anymore.
Phoebe  Oh, ok. Fine, I'll just, I'll take the hat back (she puts the hat in a bag and she crushes it angrily on the floor with her foot).
Rachel  Hey, so you guys, the funniest thing happened, at work...
Phoebe  My songs aren't good enough for your restaurant?
Rachel  Ok, we're still on that.
Monica  I didn't say your songs were not good enough.
Phoebe  Then what's wrong with them? Would they not go with your tiny portions of pretentious food?
Monica  Tiny portions?
Phoebe  Yeah well, "excuse me, I ordered the smoked salmon appetizer, but (peering through her spectacles) I can't see it, I can't see it"!
Monica  Phoebe, it's not about quantity.
Phoebe  Well...it's not about quality.
Monica  Oh really, you want to talk about quality? Have you heard of a key? It's what some people sing in.
Phoebe  Well at least all my songs don't taste like garlic. Yeah, there are other ingredients Monica.
Monica  Ok, so that's what we're doing. You know, when I'm in the coffee house bopping along to one of your songs, I'm wearing ear plugs.
Phoebe  Ear plugs, or cloves of garlic?
Monica  You know what? I take back what I said before. You keep playing at the restaurant, because with your music driving people inside, my bar sales are going up like crazy.
Phoebe  What are people having, the garlic Martini?
[Scene  Hotel's reception]
Receptionist  Here's your copy of the bill, we hope you enjoyed your stay.
Chandler  Oh we did, and you still have all your lamps.
Chandler  Oh, I didn't factor in the room tax.
Ross  Oh dude, don't worry about it, I found an unattended maid's car. We're way ahead of the game.
Ross  Oh my god.
Chandler  What?
Ross  There's something new in the bowl.
Chandler  Look, we have enough, just walk away.
Ross  No, but I want...I want the pinecones!
Chandler  There's a forest right outside.
Ross  It's not the same.
Chandler  Ok, go quick!
Ross  (to the receptionist) Thank you for a delightful stay.
Ross  Oh, my maple candy!
[Scene  In front of Monica's restaurant. Phoebe is playing]
Phoebe  (singing) Food here at 'Javu'..will kill you..the food here at 'Javu' ...will kill you..
Monica  Thank god, it's just you! I thought someone was swinging a bag of cats against the wall.
Phoebe  You'd better get back in that kitchen Monica, the garlic is not gonna overuse itself.
Monica  Ok, you have to stop playing now.
Phoebe  Why? The only person my playing is bothering is you!
Monica  Oh yeah? Ok, let's settle this, come on!
Phoebe  (while Monica drags her in the restaurant) Get your garlic-peelers off me!
Phoebe  Ok, ok, how many of you enjoyed the music outside? (a few people raise their hands) Ha!
Phoebe  Ok, well, who identified the tone of this restaurant as pretentious comma garlicky?
Monica  Ok who thinks the food is delicious and a little pretention never hurt anyone? (a few raise their hands)
Phoebe  Ok, well, alright, who thinks the food is fine, the music was fine, but your evening was ruined by this incessant poll taking? (all raise their hands).
Phoebe  Oh...Who was so stupid and stubborn that she lashed out against her friend's cooking which she actually thinks is pretty great! (raises her hand)
Monica  I'm sorry...
Phoebe  I'm sorry too... (they hug)
Monica  ooohh... hey! Wanna stick around and I'll whip you up some dinner?
Phoebe  Yeah! As long as it's free! Food here is ridiculously over-p...
Phoebe  (smiling, raising her hand) Who's hoping the hand raising thing is still cute enough that you won't hate me?
[Scene  Joey and Rachel's apartment, Rachel walks in]
Rachel  Hey!
Joey  Hey!
Rachel  Joey, do you have peanut butter on the back of your head?
Joey  (Touches the back of his head and licks his fingers) Oh man! I thought I got it all!
Rachel  (looks puzzled) How...how...?
Joey  I was making a peanut butter smoothy, right?
Rachel  uh-huh
Joey  And I couldn't find this little plastic thing (holds up plastic thing) that goes on top of the blender...and I thought...well... how important can that be, right...? Turns out very!
Rachel  (to herself) Wow...definitely just Drake...
Joey  What?
Rachel  What...how is it going with Drake?
Joey  Oh...I don't think it's going very well...
Rachel  What...that scene I saw was so good!
Joey  Well, I'm feeling really insecure about the one we are shooting tomorrow...
Rachel  Joey, is this that thing that you do when you say you're bad so I'll give you a compliment?
Joey  A little. Yeah no, I really am worried, you know, I mean I have to make it convincing that I'm in love with Olivia.
Rachel  So?
Joey  So...I've never played that!
Rachel  Ooh! Honey, it can't be that hard, I mean, you've been in love before?
Joey  Uh...well...just once...with you...
Rachel  Ok...this could be a little awkward...I'm just going to blow past it... well can't you just use that method actor thing where you use your real life memories to help you in your performance?
Joey  (looks at her for a moment) What the hell are you talking about??
Rachel  (shakes her head) Alright, alright look, just uh... just try to remember how  you felt when you were in love, and think about that when you're playing the scene.
Joey  (approvingly) Oh! ok, yeah, I think I can do that. Yeah ok, there's this party scene coming up.. and Olivia and her husband are there and all Drake wants to do is grab her and kiss her, but he can't... And that makes me think about all those times when I wanted to grab you and kiss you, but you didn't know so I would just pretend everything was cool, but really, it was killing me.
Rachel  (looks touched) Joey, you never..you never talked about that before...
Joey  Well.. hey, you know what else I could use? There's a scene where Drake sneaks into Olivia's bedroom, and she doesn't know he's there - which never happened with us! And he knows he shouldn't be there, but he just wants to look at her... you know? (In a romantic voice) And I remember all those mornings before you even put on your make-up, when I would think to myself, my God, she...is... beautiful... (Rachel looks very moved) and it hurts so much, cuz I knew I could never tell you (pauses, while looking at her with sentiment) but it was worth it just to be there looking at you.
(Joey and Rachel continue to look at each other in silence for a while)Joey  (excited) Thanks dude!!!This is GREAT!! (leaves Rachel very touched on the couch and goes into his room)
Closing credits
Joey  (excited) Thanks dude!!!This is GREAT!! (leaves Rachel very touched on the couch and goes into his room)
[Scene  Monica and Chandler's apartement, Monica is at the kitchen table writing something and Chandler enters kitchen area]
Chandler  I got you something from Vermont! (Sits down at the table)
Monica  (without looking up from what she's doing) Besides tampons and salt? (Then looks) Ooh! My God! Maple candy! That's so sweet of you. (Opens the box) That's weird...it's empty!
(Then Ross enters)Ross  (sounds excited) Hi you guys! what's going on, you... you guys wanna hang out...or...? (Looks around the room nervously) do you...do you guys hear a buzzing?
Ross  (sounds excited) Hi you guys! what's going on, you... you guys wanna hang out...or...? (Looks around the room nervously) do you...do you guys hear a buzzing?
[Scene  Monica's apartment]
Joey  (enters the room) Hey, you guys, what are you doing tomorrow night?
Chandler  (browsing through a diary) Well, let me see... I-I believe I'm... yes, falling asleep in front of the TV.
Joey  Look, my agent hooked me up with six tickets to a great play.
Chandler  I could fall asleep at a play.
Phoebe  What is it?
Monica  It sounds interesting!
Ross  Yeah, it does sound interesting, I mean, to listen to a woman complain for two hours, I don't think it gets bett... (Ross starts snoring, faking to fall asleep)
Phoebe  I know, I know, we can drive, we can vote, we can work, what more do these broads want?
Joey  You guys are gonna have a great time, I promise!
Ross  What? How come that you don't have to go!
Joey  I wish I could but I just found out that I have to be at work really early the next day, so I can't go, but, you know, take the extra ticket and invite whoever you want.
Chandler  (browsing through a diary) Uh, let's see, who do I hate?
Rachel  (gets up from the sofa and moves to the kitchen but Joey blocks her way) Oh, sorry... Oops, sorry.
Joey  (lifts Rachel up and moves her behind him so she can walk on) Hey, here you go.
Rachel  Ooh... oooh... (pause) (Rachel is all bah-jiggity about Joey) oh, ah... (pause) (to Monica) Can I ask you a question?
Monica  Yeah.
Rachel  Do you think it's possible for two friends to fool around and... and not have it be a big deal?
Monica  No, I don't think it ever works. Why?
Rachel  No reason.
Monica  No, no, Rachel?
Rachel  Yeah
Monica  Who do you wanna fool around with?
Rachel  (with high pitched voice) Nobody, forget it!
Rachel  (giggling and whispering) Maybe.
Monica  (whispering) You can't!
Rachel  (whispering) Why? (Monica gesticulates mumbling something that starts with "because") Seriously I did not understand a word that you said.
Monica  In the hall.
[Scene  In the hall]
Monica  You wanna fool around with Joey?
Rachel  Yeah! You know, ever since I had that dream about him, and can't get it out of my head! And what's the big deal, people do it all the time!
Monica  Who? Who do you know that are friends that just fool around?
Rachel  Ok, off the top of my head... Don and Janet.
Monica  Who, who are they?
Rachel  I know them from work.
Monica  Both of them?
Rachel  No, one of them...
Monica  Which one?
Rachel  I don't know, what were the names I just said?
Monica  Rachel, things can get incredibly complicated.
Rachel  All right, all right, you're right, I won't do anything with Joey, I just thought that we (Joey enters the hall) Ok so that would be two cups of tarragon, one pound of baking soda and one red onion? (Joey enters his apartment)
Monica  What the hell are you cooking!
[Scene  Central Perk, Ross enters]
Ross  Hey!
Monica  Hey!
Chandler  Hey!
Ross  Hey, you guys won't believe what I have to do for work today.
Chandler  Yes, but, Ross you chose a career of talking about dinosaurs.
Ross  (covering with his hand Chandler's face, like pretending he's not there) (to Monica) There're these two professors who are joining my department and I have to meet them here and show them around campus.
Monica  What's so bad about that?
Ross  It's I just know they're gonna be a couple of windbags wearing tweed jackets with suede elbow patches.
Ross  (looking his elbow, where there's a patch) These aren't suede.
Charlie  (to Gunther) Excuse me, I'm looking for someone. You don't, by any chance, know a Ross Geller?
Gunther  No.
Ross  Hi, hi, I'm Ross Geller.
Charlie  Oh, hi. I'm professor Wealer.
Ross  Oh, oh, that's, that's, that's nice.
Charlie  It's a... It's good to meet you! Thank you so much for taking the time out to show me around.
Ross  Oh, no, it's no big deal, I mean, if I weren't doing this I'd just, you know, be at the gym working out.
Monica  (to Chandler) Is he gonna introduce us?
Chandler  (to Monica) No, I think we're just blurry shapes to him now.
Charlie  And, by the way, I really enjoyed your paper on the connection between geographic isolation and rapid mutagenesis.
Ross  Oh, ha, I wrote that in one minute.
Monica  (to chandler) Twenty bucks says they're married within the month.
Ross  (hitting Monica with his suitcase) (to Charlie) We should probably get going, you know, we got a lot of ground to cover.
Charlie  Oh, ah, isn't there another professor that is supposed to come with us?
Ross  I don't think so.
Charlie  I'm pretty sure, professor Spafford from Cornell?
Ross  Oh, well he's obviously late and the rule in my class is "if you can't come on time, then don't come at all". (pause) An option that many of my students use. (pause) Shall we?
Charlie  You don't think we should wait for him?
Ross  You know what, he's a big boy, I'm sure he'll find us, ok?
Professor Spafford  Professor Geller?
Ross  Oh, damn it!
[Scene  Joey's apartment]
Jane  (from the answering machine) Hi Joey it's Jane Rogers, can't wait for your party tonight. Listen, I forgot your address, can you give me a call? Thanks, bye.
Joey  (entering the room) Hey!
Rachel  Hey!
Joey  What's happenin'?
Rachel  Yeah, it's a real shame you can't make it to that one-woman show tonight.
Joey  Oh, I'd love to, but I gotta get up so early the next day and so, you know me, work comes first
Rachel  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah... (she plays the answering machine)
Message  "Hi Joey, it's Jane Rogers can't wait for your party tonight" (Joey's upset and stops it)
Joey  (yelling) Stupid Jane Rogers!!
Rachel  (angry) You are having a party tonight??
Joey  Kinda have a... a thing for the Days Of Our Life's people.
Rachel  And you weren't going to tell us? How did you think you were gonna get away with that?
Joey  I do it every year.
Rachel  You do that every year??
Joey  I didn't have to tell you that!! I'm stupider than Jane Rogers!!
Rachel  Oh, that's why you got these tickets to that play, to get rid of us??
Joey  Yeah...
Rachel  And last year is that why you sent us to that medieval times restaurant?
Joey  Yeah...
Rachel  OH! And the year before that, when you set up that nighttime tour of that button factory?
Joey  (Smiling) I can't believe you guys went for that one!
Rachel  Joey, why wouldn't you invite us to your parties?
Joey  You're fine, ok? But everyone else acts like an idiot around famous people!
Rachel  Well, then so you just invite me...!
Joey  (speaking aloud) Please, I was trying to be nice, you're the worst one!
Rachel  Oh, Joey, come on! Please, please! Let me come, I will behave, I promise! I will behave! Please, please, please...
Joey  Ok, ok! Fine! You can come, but don't tell anybody else. It's up on the roof at 8.
Rachel  (yelling and jumping like a child) OH, a soap opera roof party!! I'm going to a soap opera roof party!! Oh my God, oh my God!! (realizing how she's behaving) And it's out of my system!
[Scene  Ross, Charlie and Professor Spafford are sitting at the table in a restaurant]
Professor Spafford  (speaking very slowly) And then my wife and I went on a cruise to the Galapagos. There was a sea food buffet you wouldn't believe. There were clams, and mussels, and oysters, and cracked crab, and snow crab, and king crab. It's a pity I'm allergic to shellfish.
Ross  (very bored, he tries to avoid the conversation speaking to Charlie) So, where did you get your undergraduate degree?
Professor Spafford  And that's not all I'm allergic to.
Ross  (to Charlie) Oh, it's not over!
Professor Spafford  I'm also allergic to peanuts, and cashews, and almonds, and filberts...
Ross  So basically all nuts?
Professor Spafford  Interestingly... no.
Charlie  Kinda playing fast and loose with the word "interesting".
Professor Spafford  If you'll excuse me I'm going to use the restroom. (he goes away)
Charlie  Oh my God!!
Ross  I've lost the will to live.
Charlie  Let's ditch him!
Ross  What?
Charlie  Come on, he's still in the bathroom! I'm begging you!
Ross  Oh... ok, fine. But... ehm... I just have one question for you, ehm... (aping Professor Spafford) When we exit should we walk, or run, or prance, or stroll...
Charlie  Stop it, stop it! He talks slow but he might pee fast! Ok, let's go!! (they run outside)
[Scene  Monica and Chandler's apartment]
Ross  (entering with Charlie) Oh, hey you guys! This is Charlie! Charlie, this is Phoebe and my sister, Monica.
Phoebe  Hi!
Ross  Yeah, Charlie is gonna be joining my department.
Phoebe  Oh, you're a paleonthologist, too! (pause) Oh, ok, now, what do you think of Ranion's new theory of species' variegation in segmented arthopods?
Charlie  Well, I think he's a little out there, but he does have some interesting ideas...
Phoebe  Ah, ah.
Charlie  (her mobile phone rings) Oh, I'm sorry. I'll take this. Excuse me. (she cuts herself off for a moment)
Ross  (to Phoebe) Ranion's theory of species variegation?
Phoebe  Yeah, I saw the article on your coffee table and I memorized the title to freak you out!
Monica  (to Ross) So, did you two have fun?
Ross  Oh my God, she's great! I mean, we-we have so much in common and she's just cool, and funny...
Monica  And I don't know if you've noticed but she's a (aloud) HOTTY!! (Charlie looks at her) HI!
Rachel  (she enters wearing a bath-robe) Hey... Hi you guys! Listen, you know what? I'm not feeling really well. I think I can't get out for the play.
Ross  Really? Wh-what's wrong?
Rachel  I don't know! I think it's kind of serious! Oh, you know... I was watching this thing on TV this morning about... Newcastle disease... and I think I might have it!!
Charlie  Oh, Newcastle disease is a secretion borne virus that only affects chickens and... other poultry.
Rachel  ... Ok, who is this?
Ross  I'm sorry, Rachel, this is Charlie Wealer, she's a collegue.
Rachel  Oh, hi! I would check your hand but... I'm sure you don't want to get my chicken disease!
Monica  Hey, Rachel, Can-can I see you for a sec?
Rachel  Sure! (Monica takes her apart) Oh...
Monica  You're not sick!
Rachel  What? Yes, I am!
Monica  Ok, then, why are you... (she opens her robe revealing a nice black dress) all dressed up??
Rachel  When you're sick, you do whatever you can to make yourself feel better! (she closes her robe)
Monica  You just wanna stay home so you can make a move on Joey!
Rachel  Oh, no, no! I heard you before, that is so not what this is!
Monica  Ok, what is this?
Rachel  Ok! (whispering) Joey is having a secret Days Of Our Lives party up on the roof and he sent you guys to the play to get rid of you!
Monica  (aloud) WHAT?
Ross  (looking at them) Wh-what's going on?
Monica  Joey is having a secret Days Of Our Lives party up on the roof!
Rachel  And he didn't want you guys to know about it but I came over here to tell you!!
Charlie  I thought you came to say you were sick.
Rachel  Ok professor or detective?
Phoebe  Joey's having a party and he wasn't gonna invite us?
Rachel  Yeah, and he does it every year! That's why he's sending you to that play! That's why he sent us to that medieval restaurant and to that button factory!
Phoebe  And that horrible museum tour!
Ross  No, I arranged that...
Joey  (sounds tired) Hey you guys, I'm turning in. Have fun.
Phoebe  We know about your party Joey.
Joey  What party?
Monica  The game's over! Take off your robe!
Joey  (looks perplexed and opens up his robe) Ok... I mean...
Everyone  No!! Cover it up!!
Joey  (to Charlie after covering himself up again) Nice to meet ya! (Charlie waves hesitantly and Joey leaves)
[Scene  The Roof]
Joey  (To some people) Hey! Hey alright! Hey, glad you could make it (Shakes a man's hand) Thanks for coming.
Monica  Oh my God! Kyle Lowder!
Kyle Lowder  (to Monica) Hi. (walks on)
Monica  (Yells after him) I love you!
Joey  Hey, that's why I didn't invite you. you have to calm down, alright... go, go get yourself a drink or something...
Monica  Oh yeah that's what you want - my inhibitions lowered.
Phoebe  Hey!
Monica  (Excited) Oh my God, can you believe we are surrounded by all this? I can barely control myself.
Phoebe  Monica, you might want to remember that you are married. Where is Chandler anyway? (Looks around)
Monica  (Shocked) Oh my God! Chandler!
[Scene  The theater. Chandler is sitting in the otherwise empty front row, looking around nervously]
Chandler  Where the hell is everybody?
[Scene  The Roof, Rachel is talking to a guy who hands her a tissue with something written on it]
Rachel  Ok actually Mon, Matthew was just giving me his phone number.
Monica  Oh man! If I had known I was coming to this party I never would have gotten married!
Matthew Ashford  It was nice to meet you Rachel.
Rachel  Nice to meet you.
Matthew Ashford  Call me.
Rachel  Ok
Monica  (yelling after him) We will!!
Monica  (to Rachel) Look at you with all the guys!
Rachel  Yeah!
Monica  I guess you have forgotten all about Joey?
Rachel  Yeah, well, I guess I have forgotten about Joey and clearly you've forgotten about Chandler!
Monica  Please... Chandler is the love of my life... (At which point a man in leather pants walks by)... oooh leather pants! Have Mercy! (Follows the man in the leather)
Ross  (to Charlie) So, eh... it's probably gonna be hard for you to leave Boston, huh?
Charlie  Actually, I'm kinda happy to be leaving... I just broke up with someeone.
Ross  Ooh... so sad... Still, it can't be easy for you to leave Harvard? Especially after working alongside a Nobel Prize winner like Albert Wintermeyer?
Charlie  Actually, Alby is the guy I broke up with.
Ross  You... you dated Albert Wintermeyer?
Charlie  Yeah...
Ross  ... And you called him Alby!? (laughs) I mean that's like... like calling Albert Einstein... er... Alby...
Charlie  Yeah, well, he is a brilliant man.
Ross  Eh, you think? I mean, you went out with a guy who improved the accuracy of radiocarbon dating by a factor of 10!
Charlie  Yes! And while that is everything one looks for in a boyfriend, he had a lot of issues...
Ross  (very interested) Oh! like what?! (Charlie looks at him confused, but smiling) Oh I'm sorry, I don't mean to pry... it's just that this must be what regular people experience when they watch "Access Hollywood".
Charlie  Ok, you want the dirt? Alby was seriously insecure. I mean, he was really intimidated by the guy I dated before him.
Ross  Who is intimidating to a guy who won the Nobel Prize?
Charlie  A guy who won two.
Ross  (a little suprised) Two? Wha...? Don't tell me you dated Benjamin Hobart
Charlie  Yeah... for three years.
Ross  Oh my God! Have you ever been in a relationship with someone who hasn't won the Nobel Prize?
Charlie  (smiling and thinks for a moment)... no... bu but there was my first boyfriend Billy.
Ross  Oh yeah? no, no Nobel Prizes for him?
Charlie  No, but he did just win the McArthur genius grant.
Ross  Huh... huh... what a loser! Some more wine? (takes the half-full glasses and goes to the counter)
Phoebe  Hey Ross!
Rache  How is it going with Charlie?
Ross  (sarcastically) Oh Great! After I finish my wine I'm going to blow my... eh. average-sized brains out.
Phoebe  Oh, What's the matter?
Ross  She... she only dates geniuses and Nobel Prize winners. Oh my God, at the chinese restaurant earlier today, I put chopsticks in my mouth and pretented to be a woolly mammoth.
Rachel  I always loved that!!
Ross  Of course you would, your brains are smaller than mine!! (Rachel nods) Man, I can't compete with the guys she goes out with, they are so out of my league! oh my God!
Phoebe  Worse?
Ross  Oh much, much worse. I did my impression of Joan Rivers as one of the earliest amphibians... (gestures with his hands and says in an impression voice?) "Can we walk"? (Phoebe starts laughing) Oh, you... you like that?
Phoebe  (still laughing) No. (points to Rachel who stuck two straws in her mouth to look like a mammoth's tusks)
Ross  What? (turns around to look at Rachel)
Rachel  Come on! I think this is funny! (Ross leaves)
[Scene  Chandler in the theater]
Bitter lady  Well, I bet you are all thinkin' "Now would be a really great time for an intermission", huh?
Chandler  (To himself) oh yes, God yes!!
Chandler  I... I don't know... you seem lovely.
[Scene  The roof, Joey is walking towards Ross with a guy]
Joey  Hey Ross, this is one of my co-stars, Dirk. (To Dirk) Dirk, this is my good friend Ross. (Ross and Dirk shake hands)
Ross  Nice to meet you.
Dirk  Hey! So what show are you on?
Ross  Oh, I'm no actor, I'm a professor of palaeontology.
Joey  It's a science.
Dirk  Oh! Hey well listen, I play a scientist on "Days". And my character has just won the Nobel prize.
Joey  Hey Ross, listen, Dirk was wondering about the woman that you brought and if you guys were together, or...
Ross  Oh, well no, but I mean, she only goes out with really, really smart guys.
Dirk  Hey, I got a 690 on my SATs.
Ross  I'd lead with that.
Monica  That's it, just sign right on the bra (the actor does so).
Joey  Monica!
Monica  Don't worry Joe, I won't come next year!
Joey  (To Rachel) What have you got there?
Ross  Just some boys gave me their phone numbers.
Joey  Ah, let me see! (she hands him a pile of tissues) Damn, that's a lot of guys! Are you a little slutty?
Rachel  (drunken voice) I think I am.
Joey  (browsing the tissues) Let me see if I approve any of these clowns. This guy wears a rug (discards one). This guy's Canadian (discards another). And this guy is in a cult, ok, and it costs you 5,000$ to get to level three and I don't feel any different.
Joey  (discarding all the remaining tissues one by one) Pass, pass, oh, pass, double-pass, pass...
Rachel  (picking up the tissues) Why, why, what's wrong with these guys?
Joey  Nothing major, it's just that, you know, they're not really good enough for you, and you deserve the best.
Rachel  Joey, you're so sweet.
Joey  That's true. But you know what, it doesn't matter because I already know who you're gonna go home with tonight.
Rachel  Who (looks around)?
Joey  Me.
Rachel  (surprised) What? (with a nervous smile) Really?
Joey  Yes, 'cause we live together, that's a joke!
Rachel  Oh! Screw it, I didn't get it! (they high-five)
Joey  Gotcha.
Rachel  Oh, Very funny... Joey.
Chandler  (to Monica) So, how did you enjoy the play?
Monica  Oh my god, honey, I'm so so so so so sorry.
Chandler  Well you should be. You missed the most powerful three hours in the history of the theater.
Monica  You really liked it?
Monica  Oh really!
Chandler  Oh yeah, I had no idea the amazing journey you go through as a woman! Tell me, tell me about your first period!
Monica  No!
Chandler  Did somebody sign your bra?
Monica  So I got it when I was 13...
[Scene  At the counter. Ross is sitting there, drinking. Phoebe approaches him.]
Phoebe  Hey Ross! So listen, about you and the dinosaur girl, are you really just gonna let a couple of Nobel prizes scare you off? What is that, come on, a piece of paper?
Ross  It's actually a 1,000,000$ prize.
Phoebe  Go Charlie! But my point is, ok so she dated them but she also broke up with them. Maybe she's looking to, you know, 
slum it with some average Joe Phd.
Ross  Yeah, maybe. I do have my whole career in front of me. I mean, I can still win a Nobel prize. Although the last two papers I've written were widely discredited.
Phoebe  You're so much more than just brains! You're sweet, and kind, and funny...
Ross  And sexy.
Phoebe  Ok well give her a chance to see all of that!
Ross  Yeah, you're right, thanks Pheebs, I'm gonna go find her.
Phoebe  Good for you! And hey, I thought your paper on punctuated equilibrium in the Devonian era was top notch!
Ross  Stop going through my stuff (walks away)!
Rachel  (to Monica) Hey!
Monica  Hey!
Monica  No, you can't! Friends hooking up is a bad idea.
Rachel  Please, what about you and Chandler?
Monica  That's different! I was drunk and stupid!
Rachel  Well hello (points to herself)!
Monica  What about all the guys that you've got the phone numbers from? Why don't you just kiss one of them?
Rachel  I could, I could but I don't want to! I want to kiss Joey!
Monica  Alright (shrugs). I think it's a big mistake but it's your decision.
Rachel  (pause) I'm gonna do it.
Monica  And I can't stop you.
Rachel  No.
Ross  (to Rachel) Hey Rach, have you seen Charlie anywhere?
Ross  I'm smarter than him!
[Scene  The theater. Monica, Phoebe and Chandler are sitting in the first line]
Phoebe  Hey, thank you so much for these tickets, Chandler.
Chandler  Oh well, this was a really important experience for me, and I wanted to share it with you.
Monica  Oh, you're so wonderful.
Chandler  Can't believe you guys bought that, enjoy your slow death (runs away).
[Scene  Central Perk]
Monica  It's so weird, how did Joey end up kissing Charlie last night? 
  I thought you'd end up kissing Charlie.
Ross  Hey, I thought I'd end up kissing Charlie too ok? But SURPRISE!
Chandler  I missed most of the party (pause) Charlie's a girl, right?
Ross  Yes, she is this new professor of my department that I did 
  not kiss.
Rachel  I don't know why Joey had to kiss her! I mean, of all the girls 
  at the party, GOD!
Ross  Why do you care so much?
Monica  Yes Rachel, why do you care so much?
Rachel  (worried) Be-cause Ross is the father of my child! You know... 
  and I... want him to hook up with lots of women! (pause) I just... All I'm saying 
  is... I don't think that Joey and Charlie have anything in common.
Ross  Oh, I don't know, they seem to have a shared interest in each 
  other's tonsils...
Phoebe  Wow, Joey and a professor! Can you imagine if they had kids 
  and if the kids got her intelligence and Joey's raw sexual magnetism... Oh, 
  those nerds will get laaaaaid!
Rachel  All right, so... Ross, you're ok with all this? I mean...
Ross  Yeah, it's no big deal. I mean, I just met her and I'm fine with 
  it...
Ross  Oh, God. I forgot how hot she was!
Joey  Hey!
All  Hi!
Ross  I'm gonna get some more coffee.
Charlie  Oh, you know what? I'll come with you!
Ross  Ok. (they both go)
Chandler  (to Joey) So, a professor, uh?
Joey  Yeah! She is cool, and she's so smart! Her mind is totally acrimonious 
  (which, being Joey, he mispronounces "amonious"). (pause) That's not 
  how she used it...?
Charlie  (talking to Ross) I feel like I owe you an explanation. I don't 
  ordinarily go around kissing guys at parties. I'm... well, I'm kind of embarrassed. 
  I really hope you don't think less of me.
Ross  Uhm no! Think less of you! No, I don't think less of you. I mean, 
  you saw someone you liked and you kissed them. I mean, those people who like 
  someone and don't kiss them... those-those people are stupid, I hate those people.
Charlie  You know, actually I'm a little surprised to myself. I mean, 
  Joey is so different from the guys I usually date. I mean, they're all professors, 
  and intellectuals, and paleontologists mostly, you 
  know, very cerebral...
Ross  Yeah, I know the type.
Joey  Hey, if you wanna grab a bite before work we'd better get acrimonious. 
  No? Am I getting close?
[Scene  Joey and Rachel's apartment]
Phoebe  (entering) Hey!
Monica  Hey!
Phoebe  Hey you guys! Look what I just got. (she shows them a pair of 
  slippers)
Rachel  Oh, OH! Wow, I love those! Where did you get them?
Phoebe  I bought them off Ebay! They used to belong to the late Shania 
  Twain.
Rachel  (after a pause) Phoebe, Shania Twain is still alive!
Phoebe  Oh... then I overpaid. (she goes to the bathroom)
Monica  Hey, what's this?
Rachel  Oh, it's a gift certificate to this new SPA in SOHO.
Monica  Oh, you can't show Phoebe this! She hates those corporate massage 
  chains.
Rachel  Ah, why, now I can't get a massage? There are so many things 
  that she disapproves of! I can't eat veal, I can't wear fur, I can't go hunting...
Monica  Do you wanna go hunting?
Rachel  Well, I would like to have the option!!
Phoebe  (coming back from the bathroom) What's up? (she sees the gift 
  certificate in Rachel's hands) Hey, Rachel!!
Rachel  Oh!
Phoebe  No, you can't go there! You know how I feel about these "big 
  massage places"! They're putting people like me out of business!
Monica  And she wants to go hunting, too!!
Rachel  Phoebe, come on, I don't wanna waste it! It would be like throwing 
  away a hundred bucks!
Phoebe  Ok, this is not about the MONEY, ok? It's about... it's 
  about corporate greed destroying our hearts and leaving us... the hollow shells.
Rachel  I don't care about any of that!!
Phoebe  Well, do you care about friendship?
Rachel  Oh!
Phoebe  I feel really strongly about this, Rachel. Please, don't use 
  this gift certificate. I'm asking you as a friend.
Rachel  Oh, not as a friend, Phoebe!! Fine, I won't use it!
Phoebe  Promise?
Rachel  I promise.
Phoebe  Thank you. (she tears up the gift certificate)
Rachel  But I am going hunting!!
[Scene  Monica and Chandler's apartment]
Monica  (entering) Hey honey! I missed you today!
Chandler  Oh, yeah?
Monica  Yeah. (they kiss) What d'you wanna do tonight?
Chandler  Oh, well... Maybe we could... (he sweeps the stuff off the 
  table and wordlessly invites Monica to have sex on it)
Monica  Ok, trying to turn me on by making a mess? Know your audience! 
  Besides, tomorrow we're doing those fertility tests and until then you need 
  to keep your tadpoles in the tank.
Chandler  We really need to take those tests?
Monica  Honey, we've been trying to have a baby for over a year. I think 
  it's a good idea to find out if everything's ok. Just a few routine tests.
Chandler  But I don't wanna do it in a cup!
Monica  What is the big deal?
Chandler  It's weird! In a doctor's office?
Monica  It's not ok to do it in a doctor's office but it is ok to do 
  it in a parked car behind a Taco Bell?
Chandler  (embarrassed) I cannot believe Ross told you that! (pause) 
  And in my defense, it was a Wendy's!
Monica  Look, I don't wanna do this test either, but I really do think 
  it's a good idea!
Chandler  Yeah, ok. I'm sure that doctor's office can't be worst than 
  on a class trip to the Hershey's factory!
Monica  (really embarrassed) OH!
Chandler  Oh, yeah! RACHEL TALKS TOO!
[Scene  Joey's apartment]
Joey  (sipping red wine from a glass) Who says that wine has to cost 
  more than milk!
Joey  Heeey!
Charlie  Hi!
Joey  Come on in, how are ya?
Charlie  I'm good!
Joey  Can I offer you a drink?
Charlie  Please, I've been crazed all day! I had a meeting with 
  the Dean, and my syllabus for summer school is due and I'm writing the Foreword 
  for a friend's book...
Joey  Uh-oh. I hade a pretty hectic day at work too, today I had to 
  open a door and go (looking scared) ohhhh!
Charlie  So I am just so excited to be 
  here. And I can't wait to start exploring the city!
Joey  Hey, if you need a tour guide... (point to himself)
Charlie  Oh, you mean it? That would be so fun!
Joey  Yeah, definitely, definitely. Ok, what do you wanna see first?
Charlie  Oh, well, we can go see the Chronos Quartet at the Avery Fisher 
  Hall.
Joey  (looking puzzled and nodding) Ok!
Charlie  And there is a collection of Walt Whitman letters on display 
  at the public library.
Joey  I know, yeah!
Charlie  And first, I have to see the MET!
Joey  Ok, let me stop you right there. The Mets suck, ok? You wanna 
  see the Yankees.
Charlie  No, no, no, not the Mets, the MET, singular!
Joey  Which one, they all suck!
Charlie  The museum!
Joey  (looking puzzled) I don't think so.
[Scene  SPA massage center, Rachel enters]
Rachel  (to the receptionist) Hi there!
Receptionist  (in an affected tone) Hello, welcome to Lavender Day Spa 
  SPA. How may I help you?
Rachel  Oh, hi. I have a massage appointment under Rachel Green, and 
  here is my gift certificate.
Receptionist  This has been torn up.
Rachel  And... taped back together.
Receptionist  Ok well, I'll call you as 
  soon as your massage therapist is ready.
Rachel  Ok
Receptionist  Have a seat through the glass doors.
Rachel  (imitating the receptionist's tone) through the glass doors.
Receptionist  Through the glass doors.
Rachel  Alright-y then.
Receptionist  Phoebe, your next client's in the waiting room.
Phoebe  Ok. Do we have to talk like that then they're not around? (She 
  sees Rachel) Oh, no, no! Listen, is there someone 
  who can fill in for me?
Receptionist  Sorry, everyone is booked!
Phoebe  But that woman can't know I work 
  here. She's a friend of mine and I made this big stink about how awful this 
  massage chains are.
Receptionist  Then why you work here?
Phoebe  'Cause it's good money! But that doesn't change the fact that 
  this is an evil blood sucking corporate machine!
Receptionist  Well, I think this is a great place to work!
Phoebe  (watching around and whispering) Ok, are they listening?
[Scene  Central Perk]
Joey  Ross!
Ross  Hi!
Joey  I need to talk to you about Charlie.
Ross  (annoyed) Oh, do you, do you really?
Joey  Yeah, I'm... I'm kind of having a little problem.
Ross  Look, if you don't know what the word "acrimonious" 
  means, just don't use it!
Joey  No, look, you know Charlie, right? She's cool, she's funny, her 
  body is soo...
Ross  Get to the problem!
Joey  Yes. It's just that she's so much smarter than all the girls I've 
  ever dated! Combined! I don't want her to think I'm stupid!
Ross  (looking down) Are you wearing two belts?
Joey  (checking) EH, what do you know!
Ross  You were saying you didn't want to seem stupid.
Joey  Right, right, right, well, she wants to go to all this cultural 
  places and I don't know how to talk about that stuff. You gotta help me out!
Ross  You know, I really don't want to 
  get involved in you guy's relationship.
Joey  Please, c'mon, you're the smartest person I know and I really 
  like this girl, ok, I don't wanna lose her.
Ross  (after a short hesitation) Fine.
Joey  Thanks.
Ross  Ok. Let's see. Oh, you should take her to the MET!
Joey  The Metsss!
Ross  Oh, no! The MET! The Metropolitan Museum of Art.
Joey  (realizing) Oh, that's what she meant! (pause) You know, if they're 
  gonna shorten it, they should call it the MUSE! You know, short for museum, 
  and avoid all the confusion!
Ross  Yeah, most of it it's a place  packed with confused angry 
  baseball fans!
Joey  Ok, all right, so I'll take her to the MET.
Ross  Yeah, uh, uh, ok, there's this great rare bookstore 
  on Madison Avenue. You know what? She loves architecture, 
  you know what you should do? You should take a walk down fifth to the 
  Saint Patrick's Cathedral and there there's this great little pastry shop that 
  she'd love.
Joey  Geez, sounds like you should be going on this date!
Ross  But I'm not! (pause). You know what if you're in the mood for 
  Thai food...
Joey  Whoa, whoa, whoa! Slow down, you go way too 
  fast. Ok? Just go back to the MET, ok?
Ross  Ok.
Joey  You got to tell me exactly what to do there.
Ross  Ok, when you walk in the museum, take the right, that's the antiquities 
  wing. Ancient Egypt, Mesopotamia, up to the Byzantine Empire.
Joey  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! So, I walk in the door and make 
  the right (and he bends his arm to the left. Ross then bends Joey's arm to the 
  right and Joey nods)
[Scene  doctor's waiting room]
Chandler  I have a weird feeling about this place. (pause) How do I 
  know that they are not gonna secretly videotape me and put it all over the internet.
Monica  Because, honey, I mean this in the sweetest way possible, nobody 
  is gonna wanna watch that.
Nurse  Mr. Bing? (Chandler jumps up) Here you are! You'll go into that 
  room and deposit your specimen into the container.
Chandler  Deposit my specimen? You know, 
  usually I have to call a  900 number for that kind 
  of talk. Thanks, got it.
Monica  Hey, honey, my test is down the hall, are you sure you're going 
  to be ok?
Chandler  Yeah, I guess!
Monica  I know this is embarrassing, but nobody cares! No one here even 
  knows you!
Janice  OH MY GOD!!
Chandler  Oh, Come on!
Janice  Ah ahahahhahaa! How great is this!
Monica  Hey, we're probably fertile, let's go home!
Chandler  Why are you here?
Janice  Well, Sid and I are trying again and we had trouble last time 
  because apparently we...
Chandler  (to Heaven) No no no... I mean, why? why is 
  she here??
Janice  Oh! Someone's a little cranky today cuz 
  they have to do it in a cup! (laughs) Oh! They gave you the kiddy size (looking 
  at the cup in his hand).
Chandler  What!?
Monica  This was fun! But I've got an invasive vaginal exam to get to! 
  (leaves)
Chandler  I'd love to stay, but I have eh... (points at the cup) got 
  a hot date... (starts to leave)
Janice  Please... go! (Then shouts after him) Just let me know if you 
  need a hand!
Chandler  (disgusted) I think it just fell off. (Leaves)
[Scene  At the Spa, Phoebe is at the half-opened door]
Phoebe  (In a strange heavy accent) Hello "ja", it's time 
  for your massage, ja! Put your face in the hole.
Rachel  Wow, a Swedish massage from a real Swedish person. (Puts her 
  head in the hole and Phoebe enters)
Phoebe  Okay, then I'm Swedish...
Monica  So, what's your name?
Phoebe  It's a normal Swedish name... Ikea...
Rachel  Oh... what an interesting name.
Phoebe  Ja!
Rachel  You know I... (lifts her head and tries to look in Phoebe's 
  direction)
Phoebe  (pushes her head back down) Time for your scalp massage!
Rachel  (Sees Phoebe's slippers through the hole) Wow... I really love 
  your... (startled as she realizes those are Phoebe's slippers)
Phoebe  Is something wrong?
Rachel  No, it's just that uhm... it feels so good... Ikea... (pause) 
  Yeah, say hey, you'll know this, what's the capital of Sweden?
Phoebe  (Thinks for a few moments) Uhm... Stockholm.
Rachel  Damn! I wish I knew if that was right!
[Scene  Joey's apartment, Joey and Ross in the living room, 
  rehearsing what Joey will say to Charlie in the Museum]
Joey  (gesturing at an imaginary painting) Note the painterly 
  lines and subtle impasto on this canvas. Monet painted quickly and usually outdoors 
  as his elusive subject was light itself.
Ross  Now, do you have any idea what you just said?
Ross  Ok now, remember, when you get to the museum, Monet is not spelt 
  M-O-N-A-Y. I just... I wrote that out phonetically for you.
Joey  Phonetically? (Looks confused)
Ross  Yeah, yeah that means... you know? We just... we don't have time 
  for this.
Joey  Ok.
Ross  Ok, but you know what? I gotta say, 
  I'm really impressed that you were able to memorize all this so quickly!
Joey  Ah! I'm an actor! I can memorize anything! Last week on "Days" 
  I had to say "Frontal temporal zygomatic craniotomy".
Ross  Wow. What does that mean?
Joey  No idea! But the guy I said it to dies in the next scene so I 
  guess it means "you're gonna get eaten by a bear".
Ross  Ok! So let's move on to the Renaissance?
Joey  Ok, Caravaggio uses chiaroscuro here to highlight the anguish 
  of the central figure. Touch it, it's really bumpy! (Reaches out to touch the 
  imaginary painting).
Ross  Nah ah! Nah ah! (stops him form doing so) No no no! No ad-libbing 
  and dude, you can't touch the paintings.
Joey  Come on! you... (reaches out to touch the imaginary painting again)
Ross  No! (Slaps his hand)
[Scene  The Fertility Clinic; Chandler walks out one of the rooms]
Chandler  (To the nurse at the nurses' station) My specimen is in the 
  room and I just want to thank whoever knocked on the door while I was in there. 
  Really helped speed the process along! (walks towards the common area and sees 
  Janice is still there) Janice! You're not... gone?
Janice  Oh! Sid is still in his room. I don't allow porn at home so 
  this is like a vacation for him. So did you do it? Did you make your deposit?
Chandler  Yeah! yeah... The hard part is over!
Janice  That's not the hard part honey! The hard part is what comes 
  next, I mean aren't you worried about the results?
Chandler  I haven't... I haven't even thought about the results yet... 
  I just assumed that everything was gonna be ok.
Janice  Oh! Well, you know what? It probably is.
Chandler  (Slightly panicky) Yeah, but what if it's not? What if there 
  is a reason why we can't have a baby?
Janice  Oh, Chandler, look. You and Monica are meant to have children. 
  I am sure it's gonna be just fine.
Chandler  (smiling again) oh, oh, yeah, ok, thanks. I can't believe 
  I didn't even think of that. I guess I was just so worried about having to... 
  come here and do... 'that'...
Janice  What, you can do it in the parking lot of a Taco Bell, but you 
  can't do it at a doctor's office?
Chandler  (stares at her intently, then yells) It was a "Wendy's!! 
  "
[Scene  Phoebe and Rachel at the Spa. Phoebe is still massaging 
  Rachel]
Phoebe  (Singing) "Ipan Stripan, Glupi Glabi! " And that is 
  the Swedish National Anthem! Thank you for asking! (looks annoyed)
Rachel  Wow, Ikea... what a rich culture. Uhm, you know what? I have 
  a friend who is a masseuse.
Phoebe  Oh, Ja! Ja!
Rachel  Yah! She's... uhm... not very good though... (Phoebe looks devastated)
Phoebe  Uhu, uhu... and why do you think that is?
Rachel  I don't know... maybe it's because she has got such callousy 
  fingers from playing crummy guitar...
Phoebe  Or... maybe she has trouble loosening your knots because you're 
  such a high maintenance tight ass!
Rachel  (now lifts her head) Phoebe!!
Phoebe  You know it's me?
Rachel  For like a half an hour! Man, you can lie about Sweden!
Phoebe  How can you come here?
Rachel  How could you not tell me you worked here?
Phoebe  I don't have to tell you everything!
Rachel  Yes you do, if you're going to make me feel guilty for getting 
  a free massage!
Phoebe  Tips not included.
Rachel  Oh! Phoebe, why did you lie to me about working here?
Phoebe  Because I was ashamed ok? I sold out for the cash! And then 
  they give me benefits like medical, and dental, and a 401K. But you know... 
  you pay a price. Now I'm this Corporate stooge and punching a clock and Ugh! 
  paying taxes!
Rachel  Phoebe, honey, if you hate it so much, you should walk out there 
  right now and quit! Be true to what you believe in! Honey, you have principles 
  and I so admire that! I don't have any!
Phoebe  You know what? You are right. I am gonna quit. It's time 
  I took my life back!
Rachel  Good for you Pheebs!
Phoebe  Ok.
Phoebe  Okay (walks out and closes the door behind her, looks up and 
  whispers) If you guys have microphones in there too, I didn't mean any 
  of that. I love you.
[Scene  Central Perk. Ross is playing some shoot'em up game on 
  his laptop]
Ross  Haha! Got ya! Die, die, die!
Ross  (recovers his composure and starts typing) Respectfully, professor 
  R. Geller. (hits <return>, closes the laptop and joins Charlie on the 
  sofa) Hey!
Charlie  Hi!
Ross  Hey, how was the Met?
Charlie  The museum was amazing!
Ross  Yeah? Joey really knows his art, huh?
Charlie  Not so much, no. He had clearly memorized all the stuff to 
  say, and some of it didn't even make any sense.
Ross  What do you mean?
Charlie  Well, for one, he was talking about paintings that were nowhere 
  around.
Ross  (perplexed for a moment) Wait a minute... when you guys walked 
  into the Met, did you go to the right?
Charlie  No, we went to the left.
Ross  (shaking head) Oh Joey, Joey! But still, I mean, it seems like 
  you guys are having a great time together.
Charlie  Yeah, it's fun (hesitating).
Ross  What?
Charlie  Actually, you know, Joey is your friend, and you don't really 
  know me that well; it would be weird.
Ross  What, I mean, a little, but no, what, go on.
Charlie  Well... I'm just thinking that maybe he's not the right guy 
  to be with right now, maybe I should be with someone... I have more in common 
  with. You know what I mean?
Ross  (slowly) Yeah. But you know what? I think you should give Joey 
  a chance. I mean, he's a great guy, and sure he doesn't know that much about 
  art but you know, you can always talk about that with someone else.
Charlie  Yeah, I guess that's true.
Ross  And if you think about it, I mean the reason he memorized all 
  that stuff is because he thought it was important to you. You 
  know, that's the kind of guy Joey is.
Charlie  He is very sweet. Plus he's hot!
Ross  That was going to be my next argument.
Joey  Hey!
Ross  Hey!
Charlie  Hey!
Joey  (to Charlie) You're ready?
Charlie  Yeah, let's go. (stands up and kisses Joey) (to Ross) Thanks 
  Ross.
Joey  (aside, to Ross) Hey Ross! That art stuff worked, you hooked me 
  up.
Ross  Glad I could help man.
Joey  Although some of that stuff wasn't where you said it was gonna 
  be, but... (confidently) I made it work.
[Scene  Monica and Chandler's. Chandler is sitting on the sofa, 
  reading the newspaper.]
Chandler  (picking up a plastic cup similar to the one he deposited 
  his specimen in) It is not okay that I'm aroused by this now.
Chandler  Hello? Oh hi, Doctor Connelly. (pause) No, she's not here 
  but, you know, I can tell her. Should I be sitting down for this? (his smile 
  fades as he hears the answer) Oh. (pause) Well, so what does that mean? (pause) 
  Ok. Ok, thank you. Thanks. (hangs up)
Monica  Hey sweetie.
Chandler  Doctor Connelly just called.
Monica  With good news? (very quickly and wringing hands) Of course 
  it is not good news, you just said (deadpan) "Doctor Connelly just called". 
  If it was good news you would have said (excitedly) "Doctor Connelly just 
  called! " But so what is it? Is there a problem, uh? Is there a problem 
  with me or with you?
Chandler  Actually it's both of us.
Monica  What?
Chandler  Apparently my sperm have low motility and you have an inhospitable 
  environment.
Monica  Oh... what does that mean?
Chandler  It means that my guys won't get off their barcaloungers 
  and you have a uterus that is prepared to kill the ones that do. (pause) It 
  means...
Monica  Chandler?
Chandler  (seriously) It means that we can keep trying, but there's 
  a good chance this may never happen for us.
Monica  (weeping) Oh my God!
Chandler  I'm sorry.
Monica  I'm sorry too.
Chandler  Well, we're gonna... we're gonna figure this out.
Monica  (still weeping) I know.
[Scene  The Spa Reception. Phoebe walks in]
Receptionist  Good morning Phoebe.
Phoebe  (imitating the receptionist's tone) Good morning receptionist.
Receptionist  Here's your schedule for the day. Your first client is 
  in room No. 1.
Phoebe  Rachel Green? (angrily) Son of a bitch, she came back?

[Scene  Central Perk. Charlie, Joey and Rachel are on the couches]
Charlie  (while Joey's giving her a massage) Oh! That feels sooo good!
Rachel  (speaking to herself and reading Cosmopolitan) Oh, lucky me! Coffee and a live sex show!
Charlie  I'm sorry, what?
Rachel  Oh... Oh, I'm sorry! I'm not... I was just-I was just reading to Emma.
Charlie  From... Cosmo??
Rachel  Yeah, yeah... It's... "climax your way to better skin".
Charlie  (to Joey) So, I have to go shopping today, which is my least favourite thing, I'm soo bad at picking out clothes!
Joey  So you need someone who knows fashion, to tell you what looks good.
Rachel  (hiding herself behind the magazine and whispering) Not me, not me, not me, not me, not me!
Joey  Oh hey Rach!
Rachel  Yeah...
Joey  Maybe you could take Charlie shopping.
Rachel  Oh, well...
Charlie  I'm sure you have better things to do.
Joey  Are you kidding? Rachel loves to shop! And she has great taste! Yeah, she's the one who taught me, you don't wear white after labour day and that you always, always, always have to put on underwear when you're trying on clothes.
Charlie  If you have the time, I'd really appreciate the help.
Rachel  Ok, uh-uh... Let's-Let's shop!!
Joey  (to Charlie) Ok, you're gonna come back with some very classy clothes... (aside to Rachel)... and some slutty lingerie, SLUTTY!
Phoebe  (entering and talking on mobile phone) Ok, great! All right, bye! (she hangs up) Pain in the ass!! (she looks at the others, then back at the phone) That's off, right?
Joey  What's the matter, Pheebs?
Phoebe  Oh... Mike's sister just invited me to a party tonight, he's gonna be there. And she was like "Oh, don't worry! I asked him. He's totally ok with seeing you!". So now I have to go so he'll think that I'm totally ok with seeing him!
Rachel  Which you're not, because you've totally hung up on him!
Phoebe  Exactly!
Rachel  And you're gonna want him to eat his heart out so you're gonna have to look fabulous!
Phoebe  (after a short pause) I didn't even think about that! (pause) Aaargh, sexual politics!!
Rachel  Hey Pheebs, I'm-I'm taking Charlie shopping, why don't you come and I'll help you find something.
Phoebe  Ok, that'll be great!
Joey  Oh, ain't that nice? The three of you trying on slutty lingerie together.
Rachel  That's not what we're gonna do!
Joey  Why would you ruin it, who was that hurtin'?
[Scene  Doctor Connelly's office]
Chandler  (looking at the picture of the female reproductive system) Wow! Fortunately she has a very pretty face!
Monica  Oh, I so can't believe this! My uterus is an inhospitable environment? I was trying so hard to be a good hostess!
Chandler  Oh, I can't believe my sperm have low motility because, let me tell you, when I was growing up they sure seem to be in a hurry to get places!!
Doctor Connelly  (entering) Hi there.
Chandler  Hi.
Monica  Hi.
Doctor Connelly  I'm sorry there wasn't better news from your test last week but I wanted to talk to you about your options.
Monica  Ok.
Doctor Connelly  Above all, even though your chances of conceiving through natural means aren't great, you never know! So, keep having sex on a regular basis.
Chandler  Oh, DAMN IT!
Monica  Don't worry, after a while he'll tune it out.
Doctor Connelly  Ok, given your situation, the options with the greatest chances for success would be surrogacy, or insemination using a sperm donor.
Monica  (long pause) Ok.
Doctor Connelly  And, of course, if you feel that neither of those is right for you, you can always adopt.
Chandler  Is that a hint? Because we love you Doctor Connelly but we don't think we'd want you to be our child! (Dr. Connelly glares at him) Wow, talking about an inhospitable environment!
[Scene  Central Perk. Joey and Charlie on the couch. Rachel enters]
Rachel  Hi! Ok, you're ready to go pick up Phoebe and go shopping?
Charlie  Oh, yeah! Let's do it!
Joey  (to Charlie) Alright, have a good time. (they kiss)
Rachel  Not gonna find any clothes in there!
Ross  (entering) Hey, you guys!
Rachel  Hi.
Ross  Guess who's up for keynote speaker at the National Paleontology Conference?
Charlie  Umh... Kurts Baley?
Ross  Yeah, right! What was last time he met a submission deadline for an abstract (he and Charlie laugh, then Joey starts laughing too without any reason) Well, why are you laughing?
Joey  Just... seeing what it'd be like to be a paleontologist... it's fun, yeah!
Charlie  So you're up for keynote speaker! Who's making the decisions?
Ross  Professor Sherman, yeah. I've a meeting with him today.
Charlie  He's a pretty tough guy to impress.
Ross  Yeah, well... I think I know how to dazzle him.
Rachel  Oh... you're not gonna do a magic trick, are ya?
Ross  Tsz... NO! (he goes to sit down, dropping a multicoloured silk streamer off his sleeve).
Chandler  (entering) Hey guys!
Ross  Wait a minute, you guys. Oh, I wanna ask you something. I-I I may get to speak at this paleontology convention and if I do, I'd love for you guys to come and hear me.
Chandler  I think I can safely say that we all have family issues, work stuff and/or are sick.
Ross  It's in Barbados.
Chandler  But you come first!
Rachel  I'm there!
Charlie  We'll see you, guys! (she goes)
Joey  Bye.
Rachel  Bye, see ya. (she goes)
Chandler  (sitting down on the couch) Ok.
Joey  All right, so. How did it go at the fertility clinic?
Chandler  Not as much fun as last time. Apparently you only get porn if you're giving a sperm sample.
Ross  So-so what did the doctor say?
Chandler  Well... there's surrogacy, but Monica has dreamt her whole life of carrying a child, she has felt that watching a surrogate would be... too hard for her.
Joey  So you're ruling out surrogacy?
Chandler  Yeah.
Joey  So, I don't have to learn what that means?
Chandler  Aside from adoption the only other choice is insemination, so... we're talking about sperm donors.
Joey  Enough said, I'm there for you man. Where is she, upstairs?
Chandler  (stopping Joey) ah-ha!
Ross  How do you feel about all this?
Chandler  I wish there was an easier way for us to have a child but I don't think there is one.
Joey  Come on Ross, be a good guy. Step up and do it!
Ross  (puzzled) What?
Ross  (looking astonished) What? NO! I am not going to give them Ben!
[Scene  Professor Sherman's office, Ross is relating to Professor Sherman]
Ross  The data we are receiving from MRI scans and DNA testing of these fossils are - are staggering.
Professor Sherman  Mmm-mm.
Ross  (reading from a notepad) I mean, we've been accepting Leakey's dates as a given, but if they're off by even a hundred thousand years or so then you can - you can just throw most of our assumptions, you know, right in the trash. (he throws the notepad in the waste bin) So-so what I am saying is - is is that (he picks the notepad back from the waste bin) is that the repercussions could be huge! I mean, not just in palaeontology, but if-if you think about it, in evolutionary biology, uh, genetics, geology, uh, I mean, truly the mind boggles!
Ross  Oh, that's not what you want...
[Scene  Shop, Rachel, Charlie and Phoebe walk in]
Shop assistant  (to a girl) Incentive For Men?
Phoebe  Oh, I'll take some of that.
Rachel  Pheebs, that's for men!
Phoebe  No, I know, this way when I go to the party later Mike will know I am over him cause I'm gonna smell like another guy. (to the shop assistant) Yeah.
Phoebe  Ok. Oh good, I'm dating a Russian cab driver. (to the shop assistant). Seriously does anyone buy this? I smell like beets!
Charlie  (to Rachel) So, you know what, I really like those jackets with the shoulder pads on them. Where do you think those would be?
Rachel  On Melanie Griffith in "Working girl". I think what you want is over here.
Charlie  See, I told you I needed someone! Oh, you know, by the way, as a "thank you", I would really love to take you out.
Rachel  Really?
Charlie  Yeah! Actually Joey and I are going to the movies tonight, wanna come?
Rachel  Oh, I can't. Because I-I've seen them.
Charlie  You've seen all the movies...
Rachel  Yeah! I'm a big fan! Of the movies, you know. Motion pictures. The Talkies!
Phoebe  (picks up a dress) Hey Rach, will you come with me to a dressing room?
Rachel  Sure!
Phoebe  Ok!
Charlie  Wha, you know, maybe we can do something else!
Rachel  You know that depends on what it is! I've done a lot of stuff.
Phoebe  So what were you doing out there, do you not like Charlie?
Rachel  She's ok, I just don't get a really good vibe from her!
Phoebe  Why?
Rachel  I don't know, you know, just the way she waltzed in here all smart, and tall! You know, and just swept Joey off his feet... I mean, nobody else has a chance!
Phoebe  Who else?
Rachel  Anybody! You, me, you know, Monica's mom...
Phoebe  You like Joey?
Rachel  Shhhhh! Phoebe! All right, look. I have a little thing for him.
Phoebe  (whispering) Oh my God!
Rachel  It's just physical and I have it totally under control! Ok? It's just, when I see them together, sometimes I just get a little jealous!
Phoebe  Uh, wow! Isn't it ironic that he liked you and now you like him?
Rachel  (annoyed) Oh, I get it!
Phoebe  Oh well, as long as it is under control, you know, you can't do anything about it, he's already dating her, and she is a nice person, that wouldn't be right.
Rachel  I know, I know, so it is just not a big deal.
Phoebe  Yeah.
Rachel  So can we keep this between us?
Phoebe  Sure!
Rachel  Ok, great, because I gotta get out of here, the smell of beets is killing me!
Phoebe  Oh.
Phoebe  Any chance Charlie has a deaf twin?
[Scene  Monica's apartment, Chandler walks in with a friend of his while Monica is putting fruit in a bowl.]
Monica  Hi honey!
Chandler  Hey! Look I brought a friend for dinner, this is Zack, from work!
Monica  Oh, of course, it's so nice to see you again, Zack!
Zack  (shaking Monica's hand) You too.
Chandler  You guys haven't actually met before, but, boy! You're both polite! (pause) Go to have a seat Zack, and I'll get you a beer.
Monica  I got it.
Zack  Thanks.
Chandler  (to Mon) So, Zack's pretty nice, uh?
Monica  Yeah, I guess.
Chandler  So, how would you like to have a baby that's half yours and half his!
Monica  (turns around and she's quite shocked) Excuse me?
Chandler  Well, we're talking about sperm donors and Zack may be the guy! I mean, look, he's intelligent, he's healthy, he's athletic, I mean, he is "spermtastic"!
Monica  Chandler, this is crazy! What did you even say to him! "Come up, meet my wife! Give us your sperm"!
Chandler  No, I invited him to dinner so you could get a chance to get to know him! I mean, if we go through a sperm bank you never meet the guy, get to check him out.
Monica  Chandler!
Chandler  I'm telling you, he's great! I mean, even if my sperm worked fine, I'd think he'd be the way to go!
Monica  I'm not going to be a part of this! You can't just bring some random guy at home and expect him to be our sperm donor!
Chandler  Ok!
Monica  Uh!
Chandler  (bringing the beer to Zack) Zack!
Zack  Thanks! Do you have a coaster? I don't wanna make a ring.
Monica  Tell me about yourself, Zack!
[Scene  Shop, Phoebe and Rachel are talking in front of the dressing room]
Rachel  Oh, God, do you think she heard? It would be so bad if she heard!
Phoebe  Well, maybe she didn't hear! Ok I'm gonna go into that dressing room, you stay in here and I'll talk and see if you can hear me.
Rachel  Ok, great!
Rachel  Oh, thank God I can't hear a word that you're saying!
Phoebe  (sticks her head out) I didn't say anything yet!
Rachel  (sticks her head out too) Well, get back in there and talk!
Phoebe  (goes back in) I'm Rachel. It's so annoying when I put Emma on the phone to talk with my friends.
Rachel  (comes out again) What!?
Phoebe  (comes out too) Well, some things are just hard to say to your face.
Rachel  Ok well, I heard that! Which means that she heard it too!
Phoebe  Ooh! We have a problem.
Rachel  Oh! What are we gonna do?
Stranger  Just be honest with her.
Rachel  Oh my God!
Stranger  And it is annoying when parents put their baby on the phone...
Rachel  (yelling at the stranger) Alright! Enough out of you!
[Scene  Joey's apartment. Joey is sitting on his bed and the phone rings]
Joey  Hello?
Ross  Joey! Hey, I need to talk to Charlie. Is she there?
Joey  No. no... eh... she went shopping with Rachel. Why? What's up?
Ross  I'm meeting with professor Sherman about my being the keynote speaker...
Joey  Oh! How's it going?
Ross  It could be better! He, uhm... he fell asleep!
Joey  What!? But I already bought my ticket to Bermuda!
Ross  Barbados.
Joey  Fine, I'll rent a car and drive...! Ross, you have to get that job!
Ross  What am I supposed to do? He's out cold! In fact he was just talking in his sleep before and evidently he wants someone named Fran to spank him harder.
Joey  Well, just wake him up!
Ross  I can't! If he realizes that I'm the one that put him to sleep, I won't get the job!
Joey  Uh! That's a tough one. Oh! Wait a minute, this happened to me before! Yeah, I was auditioning for a play and the producer fell asleep and... (pause) no wait a minute... it was me who fell asleep... Yeah I mean hey, Shakespeare, how about a chase scene once in a while!?
[Scene  Chandler and Monica's apartement. Chandler and the guest are in the living room, Monica in the kitchen]
Monica  Hey guys! Dinner's ready!
Zack  Oh! I'm gonna go wash up first. (Chandler points him the bathroom) Thanks!
Chandler  So what do you think? I want that guys genes for my kid! Those eyes, those cheeckbones!
Monica  Ok, there's enthusiastic and there's just plain gay!!
Chandler  You don't like him.
Monica  I think he is fine! It's just that we don't know anything real about him... we should get more information.
Chandler  Alright! Just follow my lead!
Zack  You guys have such a great place here.
Chandler  Oh! Thanks, I'm crazy about our place. Hey! speaking of crazy... do you have a history of mental illness in the family?
Zack  Uhm... no. Although I did have an uncle who voted for 
Dukakis.
Chandler  (very seriously) That's really not the kind of thing we are looking for Zack.
Zack  (looking very puzzled) Okaaay... so eh... so tell me, how did you guys meet.
Zack  (after a pause, very confused) No...
Monica  Eh... Heart Disease, Alzheimers, gout?
Zack  You guys don't have people for dinner a lot, huh?
Monica  We're just making conversation. (Chandler makes an agreeing-sound)
Zack  Ok. I heard a joke today. It's pretty funny...
Chandler  You know what's not funny? Male Pattern Baldness (Monica stretches her neck to look behind Zack's head and then gives Chandler an "ok" sign)
Zack  Ok listen, you guys have shown a lot of interest in me tonight and I'm flattered and... and quite frankly a little frightened. Can we just talk about something else?
Monica & Chandler  Sure! Alright...
Zack  Ravioli's delicious!
Chandler  I noticed you were enjoying that Ravioli with a beautiful set of teeth. Did you have braces as a child?
Zack  No I didn't.
Monica  Yess!! (M & C high-five and Zack looks confused again)
Chandler  (Proceeding with his dinner) We're teeth people Zack!
[Scene  In the store. Rachel and Phoebe returning from the changing rooms]
Rachel  Alright! Let's just do it. Let's just go over there and see if she heard.
Phoebe  Good plan.
Rachel  Ok. (Phoebe starts to walk in the opposite direction though. Rachel sees and follows her) Wha...? where? Where are you going?
Phoebe  Oh! I'm sorry Rachel, I don't have time for your childish games, ok? I still have to go find something incredible to wear so I can beat Mike at "who's more over who"! (at which she walks away)
Rachel  (to Charlie) Hey, hi! Hey, where've you been?
Charlie  Oh! trying on clothes.
Rachel  (pretends to be stunned) Oh! Wi... in the dres... in the dressing room!? Well, that's so weird! Phoebe and I were just trying on clothes in the dressing room. God it's just such a small world!
Charlie  (smiling) Rachel... I heard you guys whispering.
Rachel  Oh God. You did. You heard. Ok, listen, let me explain.
Charlie  No! There's nothing to explain. I heard you. Phoebe likes Joey.
Rachel  (after a pause) Yeah.
Charlie  It's just that... I don't understand it... I mean, Phoebe likes Joey and then she comes here to buy a dress to impress another guy...?
Rachel  Yeah! That's Phoebe. That's Phoebe. You know, she just wants them all! It's like she's a nympho!
Charlie  Wow!
Rachel  Yeah...
Charlie  You know, by the way. I heard you tell her not to do anything. Thanks for sticking up for me. You are such a nice person.
Rachel  (Looks ashamed) I try...
[Scene  Prof. Sherman's office. Sherman is still asleep on his chair, blocking the door.]
Ross  (To the still half asleep Professor) Oh my God! You really want me to be the keynote speaker? Thank you! (hugs him whilst still on his lap)
Prof. Sherman  (confused) You're welcome. (Ross hugs him again)
[Scene  Central Perk. Joey is sitting on the sofa, eating a cookie.]
Joey  (impressed) Wow! You look... (drops the cookie)... stop-eating hot! Which is like the highest level of hotness!
Phoebe  Are you sure? Because I'm really dreading going to this party.
Joey  Then don't go!
Phoebe  Mike knows I'm coming, and if I don't show up he'll think it's because of him! And I don't want to lose face! That's a very serious thing in my culture.
Joey  Alright, then you go to that party and you pretend to be over Mike. And afterward you come to my place and I'll get you good and drunk!
Phoebe  You got it! Ok. But not on the wine that you made, ok, because I just don't want to go back to the Emergency Room.
[Scene  Outside Central Perk.]
Phoebe  David?
David  Phoebe! Hi!
Phoebe  Oh my God! (they hug)
David  Wow, you look unbelievable.
Phoebe  Yeah. What-what are you doing here?
David  Well, I'm back from Minsk... permanently.
Phoebe  What happened?
David  Well, remember how I was trying to achieve the positronic distillation of subatomic particles?
Phoebe  Yeah?
David  Well, after eight years of research I discovered that it can't be done.
Phoebe  Well, it's great that you're back! How are you?
David  Good, good, life is good...
Phoebe  Good!
David  Ah well, I-I'm seeing someone.
Phoebe  (disappointed) Oh, good for you.
David  She's also a scientist, so she's very smart and pretty and... well, it's actually because of you, really, that we're together, I mean, I saw what you had with that Mike guy, and I just said "Boy, I want that".
Phoebe  Mike and I broke up.
David  You're kidding me. Because I'm not seeing anybody, I've just totally made that up.
Phoebe  Really?
David  Yeah, I don't know why, I'm sorry, I guess I just didn't want to lose face.
Phoebe  I understand. Yeah. Ok so then ok, so we're both living in New York, not seeing anyone. That's so not like us!
David  Yeah, I know. Well... this is probably a stupid question, seeing that you look like that, but do you have some place that you need to be right now?
Phoebe  Well... (pause) no.
David  Do you wanna get a drink?
Phoebe  I'd love to.
David  Great.
Phoebe  Ok. (they walk away together)
David  Do you smell beets?
Phoebe  Oh, got it, stay upwind of me.
Charlie  Hey, there's Phoebe! Is that Mike she's with?
Rachel  No, that's David.
Charlie  There's a third guy?
Rachel  (disapprovingly) Tip of the iceberg.
Zack  I'm gonna take off now. You're gonna let me go home, aren't you?
Chandler  You sure you don't wanna stick around a little longer?
Zack  No, no, I should get home, I'm kinda tired.
Chandler  Are you just tired now or are you always tired, 'cause that could be a sign of clinical depression.
Zack  No it's just tiring having to figure out the age at which all my grandparents died. I'll see you tomorrow.
Chandler  Ok.
Chandler  I think we've found our sperm!
Monica  Does seem pretty perfect.
Chandler  Yeah, you think so, well? Should I ask him?
Monica  (pause) No.
Chandler  Why not, just because his great-grandmother was obese, our kids are gonna get that from you anyway!
Monica  No, that's not it. It's just that when we were asking him all those questions before, I just... I just realized I don't care if he's the most perfect guy in the world... he's not you.
Chandler  Yeah, he's better!
Monica  No, he's not. And if I can't get pregnant with you, then I don't want to get pregnant by... him or anyone else.
Chandler  Really? Are you sure?
Monica  Yeah, I'm sure.
Chandler  (sighs with relief) Thank God, because I don't wanna do this either. You know, I was just doing because I thought that was what you wanted to do. You know, I'm the husband, I'm supposed to... bring the sperm.
Monica  That is so sweet. I love you. (they kiss)
Chandler  So you know this leaves us with...
Monica  Adoption.
Chandler  How do you feel about that?
Monica  I think I feel ok about it. Actually I think I feel really good about it.
Chandler  Me too. I wanna find a baby that needs a home and I wanna raise it with you. And I wanna mess it up in our own specific way.
Monica  So this is it, we're really gonna adopt?
Chandler  (smiling) Yeah.
Monica  (excitedly) Oh my God, we're gonna be parents!
Chandler  We are gonna be great parents.
Chandler  Wait, if we're lucky, and we're really really really quiet, we may be able to hear the sound of a condom breaking!
[Scene  Zack's office]
Chandler  Hey, Zack!
Zack  (hardly enthusiastic) Hey Chandler.
Chandler  Look, I just wanted to apologize for last night. I got the feeling we made you a little uncomfortable.
Zack  No you didn't.
Chandler  Really?
Zack  No you did.
Chandler  My wife and I have some boundary issues, you know, sometimes we ask inappropriate questions. We're working on it.
Jeanette  (to Zack) Here are the boards for Friday's pitch (hands him something).
Zack  Oh, thank you.
Chandler  You wouldn't know if Jeanette's planning on keeping her baby, would ya?
[Scene  Central Perk]
Joey  (entering) Hey! I'm all packed and ready to go!
Ross  Oh, that's right! (to Emma) Daddy and uncle Joey are going on a trip today. We're going to a conference in Barbados, right?
Joey  Mmh-mmh.
Ross  (to Emma) Can you say Barbados?
Joey  Barbados!
Ross  Ok, I gotta say. I mean, it means so much to me that you guys are coming all the way over there to hear me do my speech! UH! And I've a surprise, uh... I had to pull some strings but I was able to get everyone passes to the entire conference! That's right! (he gives them their passes) This babies will get you into all the paleontology lectures and seminars.
Rachel  Do you have anything that would... get us out of them?
Chandler  Yeah Ross, I mean... we're excited to hear the speech but the rest of the time we're gonna wanna do, you know, "island's stuff".
Phoebe  I think David would probably wanna hear a few lectures.
Ross  Oh, right, because he's a scientist!
Phoebe  No, no, because, you know, he's been in Minsk for 8 years and if he gets too much direct sunlight, he'll die.
Ross  Ok, we gotta go, yeah? So, we'll see you guys tomorrow.
Joey  All right, let's do it! 5 hour flight with Charlie, have a couple of drinks, get under that blanket and do what comes naturally.
Ross  It's a blanket Joe, not a cloak of invisibility!
[Scene  Paradise Hotel lounge in Barbados]
Charlie  Wow! This place is beautiful!
Ross  (very excited) Look at all these paleontologists!!
Joey  I know, there are gonna be some pasty folks by the pool tomorrow! (A woman goes towards them)
Woman  Oh my God, I can't believe you're here!
Joey  (to Charlie) I think I've been recognized, this happens all the time!
Woman  Doctor Geller, I'm such a huge fan!
Joey  That... never happens...
Woman  I've been following your career for years, I-I can't wait for your keynote speech.
Ross  Wow! This is very flattering, uh...
Woman  I would love your autograph. (hands him a notepad)
Ross  Uh, uh... Sure! Uhm... "Dear..." (he takes the notepad)
Woman  Sarah.
Ross  "... Sarah. I dig you", Uh? "Doctor Ross Geller".
Sarah  Thank you so much!
Ross  Yeah, oh and Sarah... I'd like to introduce you to my colleague, uh, Professor Wheeler, a-and this is Joey Tribbiani.
Sarah  (to Joey) Are you a paleontologist?
Joey  No, God, no! No! No no, I'm an actor. You'd probably recognize me from a little show called "The Days of Our Lives".
Ross  Dude, it's just "Days of Our Lives"... there's no the.
Joey  (thinking he's kidding) Ok, Ross! It's... It's fun, yeah! No, I-I play Doctor Drake Ramoray.
Sarah  I'm sorry, I don't own a TV.
Joey  You don't own a TV? What's all your furniture pointed at??
[Scene  Central Perk]
Monica  David, can you help me?! I'm trying to explain to Chandler how a plane stays in the air.
David  Oh, certainly. That's a combination of Bernoulli's principle and Newton's third law of motion.
Monica  (to Chandler) See?
Chandler  Yeah, that's the same as "it has something to do with wind".
Monica  Alright, I'm gonna go pick up a few things for the trip.
Phoebe  Oh, I should go, too. Oh, now... tomorrow do you guys wanna share a cab to the airport or should Mike and I just meet you there.
Phoebe  Mike?? Who's Mike?
David  Mike is your ex... uh... boyfriend!
Phoebe  That's right! Oh, yeah... Well, I've totally forgotten about im! AH! That's-That's... a blast from the past!
David  It's ok. Ho-honest mistake.
Phoebe  Really, it doesn't mean anything. I mean, you know, Monica refers to Chandler as Richard all the time!
Chandler  (upset) She does?
Monica  (pinching her) Let's get you out of here!! (they go outside)
Monica  At least you took me down with you!
Phoebe  I'm sooo sorry!! I just... I keep thinking about Mike! I'm crazy about David, and we're having so much fun together. Why-Why do I miss Mike? That's-that's gonna go away, right?
Monica  I guess, in time.
Phoebe  Yeah.
Monica  I mean, my feelings for Richard are certainly gone.
Phoebe  You just did it again. Chandler, your feelings for Chandler are certainly gone!
[Scene  Inside Central Perk]
David  (to Chandler) Well, Phoebe's still pretty hung up on that Mike, uh?
Chandler  I wouldn't read too much into it.
David  Still you know, a girl calls you by your ex-boyfriend's name, that-that's not a good thing, right?
Chandler  David, let me stop you there 'cause I think I see where this is going. I'm not very good at giving advice. So if you want advice, go to Ross, Monica, or... Joey, if the thing you wanna advice about is pizza toppings or burning sensation when you pee.
David  Sorry, I just... I wish there was something I could do, you know? Well, you know Phoebe...
Chandler  Seriously, we're gonna do this?
David  I'm sorry, uh... I just wish I could make her forget about Mike already, you know... Why did Phoebe and Mike break up?
Chandler  Oh, because his penis was too big. (he notices that David is not amused) Oh, I'm sorry, that's the kind of thing I do. (pause) They broke up because Mike didn't want to get married. Hey, what if you just let Phoebe know you'd be open to marriage?
David  That's great! That's great! I-I'll propose to her!
Chandler  What?
David  Well, I was probably going to do it at some point.
Chandler  I didn't mean now...
David  Why not? It's brilliant! (talking to an imaginary Mike) Goodbye Mike, we'll see you at the wedding, fella! (pause) well, we probably won't invite you to the wedding... (to Chandler) Thank you, Chandler. Sincerely.
Chandler  Well, you're welcome! Glad I could help.
David  (after a while) How do you think I should propose?
Chandler  David, I'm pretending to read here!!
[Scene  Joey in his hotel in room in Barbados]
Joey  Yeah! How you doin'? Yeah alright!
Joey  Hey, hey! You said you're gonna wear a thong, where's the thong?
Charlie  (laughing) I didn't mean a thong... I meant thongs...
Joey  You really should have been more clear about that!
Ross  Hey!
Joey  Hey!
Ross  (Excited) You're never going to guess who I just saw downstairs!
Joey  Oh! ah! eh... Britney Spears!?
Ross  Yeah, she never misses these conferences! (then to Charlie) No, I just saw Dr. Kenneth Schwartz!
Charlie  Oh my God! Did you talk to him?
Ross  Yeah... what am I going to say to Kenneth Schwartz?
Ross  (to Charlie) Ready to go?
Charlie  Yeah!
Joey  Wha...? You're gonna go now? I thought we could hang out?
Charlie  Oh I can't... I have seminars all day and I promised Ross I would look at his speech.
Ross  Yeah.
Charlie  But maybe we can have dinner later? On the balcony? Will be romantic.
Joey  (smiling) Will you wear a thong?
Charlie  I will if you will.
Joey  Oh... you got yourself a very weird deal!
Ross  (a little embarassed by their conversation) I'm good, I have dinner plans (moves away from them).
Charlie  So you'll be ok?
Joey  Yeah, yeah. I've got tons of stuff I could do. I'm gonna hit the beach, go swimming...
Ross  Uh, Joe, have you looked outside?
Joey  No, why?
Joey  Oh man!
Charlie  There's an indoor pool, you can swim there! (Ross agrees)
Joey  I wasn't gonna swim, I was gonna dig a hole! (removes a small plastic spade used by children to play on the beach from his backpack)
[Scene  Back in New York, Monica and Chandler in Central Perk on the couch]
Monica  Wow! That Mike thing was interesting! I don't know what's gonna happen with Phoebe and David.
Chandler  (smiling cheekily) I do! Want a hint? huh? "I do" (Monica looks confused, so Chandler repeats) "I do".
Monica  Ok, I'm sensing that this is some kind of word play, because you are pink with barely controlled glee.
Chandler  David is going to propose to Phoebe.
Monica  What? (looks very shocked) Why?
Chandler  Be-cause, we were talking about ways that he could beat Mike and I told him that Phoebe wanted to get married.
Monica  Chandler, we have talked about this. You are not supposed to give people advice! Now couldn't you just have made some sort of inappropriate joke?
Chandler  I did! A penis one! Look, just so I know, what was so wrong about what I said?
Monica  They've only been going out for a few weeks and Phoebe is completely hung up on Mike! She'll say "No", David's heart will be broken, it will be too hard for them to recover from and then Phoebe will end up alone again.
Chandler  Man, that's some bad advice!
[Scene  Barbados, hotel lounge. David, Phoebe and Rachel have just arrived.]
Joey  Oh! Hey! Thank God you guys are here!
Rachel  Hey! Hey what's going on?
Joey  Everything is upside down here! It rains all day long, nobody watches tv and Ross is famous!
Rachel  Alright, I don't wanna alarm anybody, but Monica's hair is twice as big as it was when we landed!
Monica  Ok! When I go places with high humidity, it gets a little extra body, ok?!
Chandler  That's why our honeymoon photos look like me and Diana Ross!
Joey  Come on, I'll show you guys where to check in (Joey, Chandler and David leave)
Monica  (to Chandler) Oh, honey, can you make sure we get a King size bed!
Phoebe  (shouts after David) Oh! David, get one for us too! Oh, oh, and see if they have a heart-shaped one! And with mirrors on the ceiling!
Monica  (shouts to Chandler) And make sure our room isn't next to theirs (points to Phoebe).
Rachel  Ooh! You guys are so lucky you are here with people, you known it's such a romantic place. That's all, I just wish I could (looks at Joey who is at the check in desk) share that with a guy.
Phoebe  Not Joey.
Rachel  Not Joey, no, I was just lusting after Chandler.
Monica  Yeah, right!
David  So, ehm... I'm proposing to Pheobe tonight. (Removes a ring box from his pocket and opens it to show Chandler the ring)
Chandler  Tonight?! (looks at the ring) Isn't an engagement ring supposed to have a diamond? (squints at the ring to emphasize how tiny the diamond is) Oh, there it is!
David  Yeah, well, being a failed scientist doesn't pay quite as well as you might think. That's uhm... one seventieth of a karat. And the clarity is uhm... is quite poor.
Chandler  (slaps him on the shoulder) Nice! (goes to Monica)
Chandler  Monica, can I talk to you for a sec? (Pulls her away from Phoebe and Rachel)
Monica  Ok!
Chandler  David is going to propose to Phoebe tonight!
Monica  See what happens when you give people advice? I hope you told him not to?
Chandler  That would be advice!!
Monica  Ok fine. I'll handle this. (goes to Phoebe who's talking to Rachel) Phoebe?
Phoebe  Yeah?
Monica  (looking very serious) I need to talk to you.
Phoebe  Are you leaving "The Supremes"? (Monica and Phoebe go to one side)
MOnica  Ok, my husband just gave your boyfriend some very bad advice. Look, David is going to propose to you tonight.
Phoebe  Wow? Really? That's fantastic!
Monica  What are you serious? You wanna marry him? Wha... What about Mike?
Monica  Do you really think marrying someone else is the right answer?
[Scene  Ross's hotel room. Ross and is reading his keynote speech to Charlie from his laptop]
Ross  By using CT scans and computer imaging we can in a very real way, bring the Mesozoic era into the 21st century.
Charlie  It's great. You're gonna be the hit of the conference.
Ross  Oh and you know what, it will be even better tomorrow, because I won't be constantly interrupted by Joey checking to see if they put chocolates on my pillow yet. (Someone knocks on the door, Ross goes to open and it's Joey, Rachel and Chandler).
Joey  Hey guys!
Ross  The chocolates aren't here yet.
Joey  Damnit!
Charlie  Ross just read me his speech. It's fantastic!
Chandler  Oh, is it on the computer, cuz I'd love to give it a read...?
Ross  If you want to check your email, just ask! (Chandler tries to look offended)
Chandler  (offended) What? (pause) May I?
Rachel  (looking out the window) What's with the rain, Geller? I mean, when I signed up for Dino Week, nobody said anything about it being monsoon season.
Charlie  Actually the wet season is June to December.
Rachel  It's not the time Charlie.
Chandler  (at the laptop) Oh, no, no, no dear God, no!
Joey  Oh what, did someone outbid you for the teapot? (Chandler looks annoyed at him and Joey leans in to him) Oh! Secret teapot?
Chandler  Your computer, I don't know wha... everything's gone!
Ross  Wha... what do you mean? (Goes to the laptop)
Chandler  It must be a virus. I think it erased your hard drive.
Ross  What, oh my God. What did you do?
Chandler  Someone I don't know sent me an e-mail and I opened it.
Ross  Why, why would you open it?
Chandler  Well, it didn't say "This is a virus"!!
Ross  What did it say?
Chandler  Nude... (Ross looks at him)... pictures of Anna Kournikova. I'm so sorry.
Ross  What... what am I gonna do? My speech is gone, Chandler!
Chandler  It's not gone! I mean, I'm sure you printed out a copy. You have a hard copy, right?
Ross  NO! I don't!!
Chandler  Well, you must be pretty mad at yourself right now...!
[Time lapse  Ross looks likes he's been trying to fix his computer but just closes it as if giving up]
Joey  It's really gone?
Ross  Yep! I'd like to thank you guys for coming down here to complain about the rain and ruin my career!
Chandler  I just feel awful.
Ross  Yeah, well you should! I mean, nude pictures of Anna Kournikova? I mean, she's never even won a major tournament!
Chandler  Well, I tried Billy Jean King, but... (Ross glares at him) you know, you and Monica have the same "I'm gonna kill you" look...? I can usually make it go away by kissing her... (Ross continues to glare at him and Chandler leans in as if he's going to kiss Ross)
Ross  Get out! (Chandler runs out)
Rachel  You know, this happens all the time to my computer at work.
Ross  Well, what do you do?
Rachel  Well, I usually go... play Tetris on somebody else's computer.
Ross  I can't believe this. I can't believe this is happening. I have to give the keynote speech tomorrow! Ok? I have to stand up in front of all these people. What am I gonna say?
Joey  I could teach you a speech that I memorized for auditions.
Ross  I don't think that your monologue from Star Wars is gonna help me right now, Joe!
Charlie  Ross, we can solve this. I just heard your speech. We can recreate it! We've got all night!
Ross  Wha... what you really think we can do that?
Charlie  Oh wait, Joey and I are supposed to have dinner (Looks at Joey).
Joey  Hey don't worry about that! I mean, Ross needs you! And Rachel and I will stay and help anyway we can.
Rachel  Ugh.
Ross  Alright, ok, let's do it. (Ross sits down at the desk and they all gather around him) Uhm, I know we start by discussing the shortcomings of carbon dating... uhm, and then, then I move on to what is clearly the defining moment of the Mesozoic era, the breakup of Pangea, hello! (Rachel and Joey look confused) And then, there's the... eh... there's the overview of the Triassic.
Joey  Oh, oh! Any chance any of this happened in a "Galaxy far, far away"? (Ross turns aroud and glares at him. Joey and Rachel decide to leave).
[Scene  Mike's apartment. His phone rings and he picks up]
Mike  Hello?
Monica  Ok, Mike, enough is enough, now you love Phoebe and she loves you, so you need to get over your whole "I never want to get married" thing and step up!
Mike  Who is this?
Monica  This is Monica! I'm Phoebe's friend. Listen, Phoebe is back with David and he's going to propose to her, and she is going to say "yes" but I know she really wants to be with you!
Mike  (sounds shocked and sits down) He... he's gonna propose?
Monica  I... I'm sorry, did you say something? I can't hear through all this damned hair! (Tries to move her huge hair away from the phone, in vain)
Mike  Look, if Phoebe wants to marry David, she should, I'm not gonna stand in the way of that and neither should you.
Monica  You don't tell me what to do! I tell you what to do! Just call her. She's at the Paradise Hotel in Barbados. And while I've got you, you've got curly hair. What do you do in humidity? (Mike hangs up the phone) Damnit!
Monica  (sarcastically) Well, I hope you're happy!
Chandler  (pretending not to sense the tone) Oooh! I hope you're happy too, honey!
Monica  Phoebe is going to say "Yes" to David. See, that's what happens when you meddle in people's lives!
Chandler  Phoebe is going to say "yes"? That's, that's great!
Monica  No it's not, b'cause she's still in love with Mike!
Chandler  And there's not chance that will work?
Monica  No, I called him. It's not gonna happen.
Chandler  (pointing at her) Oooooooh! Meddler! Meddler!
Monica  Well, if you hadn't meddled to start with, I wouldn't have had to go in there and meddle myself. Now, no matter how much we meddle, we will never be able to un-meddle the thing that you meddled up - in the first place!
Chandler  This vacation sucks!!
[Scene  The hall, full of paleontologists. Rachel and Joey are walking around]
Joey  I'm so bored! Stupid rain, we... we can't do anything.
Rachel  Well, I've brought some books. We could read.
Joey  Hey, it hasn't come to that yet.
Joey  (stopping the waiter) Hey hey hey! Don't mind if I do!
Waiter  I'm sorry sir, these are for the pharmaceutical convention (walks away)
Joey  Hey Rach, do you feel like going to a convention?
Rachel  We can't. We're not pharmacists!
Joey  (walking to a table with many badges on it) I know we're not, but (he picks up a badge) Frank Medeio and... (picks up another badge) Eva Trorro... womba...
Rachel  (picking up another random badge) Kate Miller?
Joey  Kate Miller it is. (he picks up the Kate Miller badge and sticks it on Rachel's breast)
Rachel  And... that's the most sex I'm gonna have this weekend.
Joey  In that case should I make sure it's on real good? (he does so, repeatedly tapping on her breast and stroking it)
Rachel  Thank you. (they walk away)
[Scene  Ross's room. Charlie is sitting on the bed, while Ross is walking up and down nervously]
Charlie  And then, and then you said that thing about, about bringing the Mesozoic era in the 21st century.
Ross  Yeah, that's it?
Charlie  Yeah.
Ross  Oh my God, we did it! (he sits beside her and skims through her notes excitedly)
Charlie  Actually I did it Ross. You remembered shockingly little of your own speech.
Ross  Yes, but I did make a pyramid out of the bath products. This is amazing, thank you, thank you so much. (he leans in, and they look at each other for a moment) That's a pretty necklace.
Charlie  Thank you.
Ross  Hey, what do you say we celebrate? Champagne? (he goes to get the champagne)
Charlie  Oh yeah! Hey, save the cork and then we can fill the bottle with water and put it back so they don't charge you.
Ross  Oh my God, I love you.
Charlie  Oh, this is such a cute picture of Emma. And is this your son... or just some kid whose picture you bring on vacation?
Ross  That's Ben, my son from my first marriage.
Charlie  Your first marriage?
Ross  Yeah.
Charlie  You're married more than once?
Ross  No. (they clink glasses and drink)
Charlie  So, why did you break up?
Ross  (embarassed) Oh, it was... it's complicated, you know? She... she was... eh... gay.
Charlie  Oh my God, this is so cool!
Ross  Ok, odd thing to get excited about!
Charlie  No, it's just... I was enganged to a guy who turned out to be gay!
Ross  Hey! High-five! (they high-five)
Charlie  Didn't you feel so stupid that you didn't see the signs? My fiancé was always going away on these long weekends with his tennis partner.
Ross  My wife had a workout friend she went to the gym with everyday for a year. She didn't get any fitter.
Charlie  I know!
Ross  And then, you try to make the best of a bad situation, so you float the idea of a threesome?
Charlie  I didn't do that.
Ross  (embarassed) Me neither.
[Scene  the Pharmacist convention. Joey and Rachel are walking out of it, drinking cocktails]
Joey  Well, who knew? Pharmacists are fun.
Rachel  I know, that old lady at the end was ready to take you home.
Joey  Not enough pills in the world, Rach. What about you, you're the single one, seen anybody in there you like?
Rachel  Well, let's see. There was a really big guy that I was talking to, with the really nice breasts...
Joey  But what about back home, anything going on there? Anybody you like?
Rachel  (takes a sip from her drink, embarassed) No.
Joey  There it is, you're blushing!
Rachel  No, I'm not blushing, I'm sunburnt! From, you know, the rain.
Joey  You like someone. Tell me who it is. Who is it? (tickles her a little)
Rachel  No.
Joey  Tell me who it is.
Rachel  Joey! (she walks away; Joey goes after her teasing and tickling her)
Joey  Come on who? Who do you like? Tell me. You're not getting away that easy. Who do you like, who?
Rachel  Joey, come on! It doesn't matter, you know, it's not like anything's gonna happen.
Joey  What? Why not? Rach, who can you not get?
Rachel  Oh! (pause) Ok. Ok, you really wanna know who it is?
Joey  (eagerly) Yeah, who is that?
Rachel  Do ya?
Joey  Yeah.
Ross and Charlie  Hey!
Charlie  (to Joey) I just left you a message! Ross and I were gonna go grab a bite, but now that you're here, maybe we can go have that dinner.
Joey  Right, of course. Hey, did you guys finish the speech?
Ross  Yep, we got it, we got it. (To Charlie) Thank you so much.
Charlie  I had a great time.
Joey  Alright, hey look, and this isn't over, because I really wanna know who...
Rachel  Later! La...
Charlie  So, shall we?
Joey  Yeah. (they leave)
Rachel  Ok. See you, bye.
Charlie  Bye.
Ross  Good night.
Joey  Night.
Ross and Rachel  Ok, good night!
[Scene  The restaurant. Chandler and Monica are sitting at a table]
Monica  I can't believe she's gonna say yes to David. She's clearly in love with Mike.
Chandler  You know, it's very hard to take you seriously when you look like that.
David  Uh, Phoebe, uh, I have... something I wanna say.
Monica  Oh my God, he's gonna do it now. Please, I cannot watch this, let's go.
Chandler  I think we have some time. Have you ever heard him talk? (doing David) "Uh, Phoebe, uh, I would be honoured, uh..." Spit it out, David!
David  Uh, Phoebe, uh... (Chandler hits his own head) you're an amazing woman, and the time we spent apart was, was unbearable. Of course the sanitation strikes in Minsk didn't help!
Phoebe  Sure, ok, yeah.
David  But well, now that we're together again, I don't ever want to be apart. So, to that end...
Phoebe  Oh my God, Mike!
David  It's David, actually!
Phoebe  No, Mike's here.
David  (turns around) Hi Mike!
Mike  Hi David. Chandler. Monica... (Looks at Monica, checking her big hair, aghast) Oh!
Monica  IT'S THE HUMIDITY!
Mike  Hi Phoebe.
Phoebe  What are you, what are you doing here?
Mike  I have a question I need to ask you.
David  I have a question I was kinda gonna ask her myself.
Mike  Yeah, I understand, but before you do, she really needs to hear this.
David  (annoyed) Ok, would you care for my seat as well?
Mike  Actually yeah, that'll be great.
David  That's fair, you've had a long trip. (he leaves his seat to Mike, and stands there looking for a chair. He finally goes to Monica and Chandler's table)
Mike  Phoebe, I love you. I mean, I missed you so much these last few months and I thought we were apart for a good reason, but then I suddenly realized that there was no reason good enough to keep me from spending the rest of my life with you.
David  Kinda stepped on the toes of what I was going to say.
Mike  Sorry David, but she really has to know this.
David  Alright, but after this I want to see you outside. If the rain stops.
Monica  You're the most incredible woman I've ever met. How can I lose you? (Phoebe looks very flattered) Now, I don't actually have a ring...
David  I have a ring.
Chandler  I wouldn't brag too much about that thing, big guy.
David  Phoebe, will you marry me?
Phoebe  (smiles at him happily for a few seconds before answering) No!
David  Uhm... Ha ha!
Phoebe  I love you. But I never needed a proposal from you. I just needed to know that we were headed somewhere, you know, that we had a future.
Mike  We can have any future you want.
David  Ok, I'm gonna take off.
Phoebe  David, I'm so sorry, I'm sorry.
David  Just so I know, if I had asked first...
Phoebe  Yeah, I might have said yes, but that would have been wrong.
David  Please, you don't have to explain. I mean, perhaps if I hadn't gone to Minsk things would have worked out for us. And I wouldn't have ruined my career, or lost that toe to frostbite. It was a good trip! (he leaves)
Mike  Is it ok if I hug you now?
Phoebe  Yes! (they hug)
Monica  (to everybody) BECAUSE OF OUR MEDDLING! Alright?
[Scene  Monica and Chandler's room. Monica and Chandler are in bed.]
Chandler  Oh, ain't this nice? It's so quiet, I could just lie here all day.
Monica  I know (she snuggles to him)
Rachel  (walking in hurriedly) Open your drapes! Open your drapes!
Chandler  I'm so glad we've got adjoining rooms!
Monica  The sun is out!
Chandler  Hey! Remember when I had corneas?
Monica  Ok listen, you go down to the pool and reserve the chairs, and I'll get the magazines and the lotion.
Chandler  Ladies? Ross's speech is in 45 minutes.
Rachel  Nooo!
Monica  Damn it!
Ross  (from across the wall) Walls are pretty thin, guys!
[Scene  Conference room. Ross is making his keynote speech]
Ross  Then we have to await the data from recent MRI scans and DNA testing which call into question information gathered from years of simple carbon dating.
Rachel  Look at that woman sitting by the pool getting tan... so leathery and wrinkled, I'm so jealous!
Chandler  (to a paleontologist sitting next to him) Not to mention the cold sores.
Ross  And that's just the herbivores. I'm not even gonna discuss the carnivores, their heads are already too big. Which is ironic considering their stunted cerebral development.
Chandler  (to the one sitting next to him) Really?
Ross  But all kidding aside, in much the same way that Homo ergaster [1] is now thought to be a separate species from Homo erectus...
Charlie  What?
Joey  He said "erectus"!
Charlie  You're... you're kidding, right?
Joey  No, he really said it.
Ross  ... and while there are certainly vast differences between these Mesozoic fossiles and the example of Homo erectus...
Joey  Erectus?
Rachel  Homo.
[Scene  the hotel conference room]
Ross  (concluding his speech)... in a very real way we can bring the Mesozoic era into the 21st century. (pauses) Thank you!
Ross  Oh, thanks guys!
Man with a bow tie  (shaking hands with Ross) I thought... it was wonderful!
Ross  Oh!
Man with a bow tie  Jarvis Oberblau, Cornell. (sighs) I mean, the ideas you put forth and, and from someone... so... young... and... (sighs again and smiles at Ross blissfully).
Ross  (with a frozen smile on his face, realizing something's wrong with Jarvis) Ok... now... now we're just holding hands! (pulls his hand away)
Rachel  All right! Well, uh... (to Monica) we're gonna hit the beach?
Monica  Yeah!
Rachel  (to Ross, in a flattering tone) It was really... great!
Ross  Oh, thank you so much!
Joey  Yeah, and so funny!
Rachel  Oh!
Ross  (puzzled) Ok!... All right, thanks! Thank you so much, you guys! (to Phoebe) Oh, I can't tell you how much it means to me that you were here!
Mike  (popping by, smiling) You're kidding, we wouldn't have missed it!
Mike  Oh... I'm back!
Ross  (skating over, embarrassed) Ok!... Uh... excuse me? Yeah?
Phoebe & Mike  Yeah! (they leave)
Ross  Hey! (she turns to him) Well...? (in expectation)
Charlie  You were incredible!
Ross  Yeah?
Charlie  You blew them away!
Ross  Oh, I can't tell you how great it was to look at the crowd and see your face! I mean... uh, did you know you were (giggles) mouthing the words along with me?
Charlie  (smiling broadly) I was not!
Ross  No, it's ok! Made me feel like a rock star!
Charlie  Oh my God! (pauses) I'm your groupie!
Ross  (joking) I'd better not found you naked in my hotel room!
Ross  (realizing his joke wasn't so good, but still giggling) Look, I took it too far!
[Scene  the hotel lobby. Monica, Phoebe, Chandler and Mike walk in from the outside.]
Monica  (her hair bigger then before) I can't believe it's raining again! Oh, it's so unfair!!!
Phoebe  Well, on the bright side, now you won't have to see all these paleontologists with their shirts off. (Grabs a drink and notices that the two men are upset) Not you guys. You got it going on!
Monica  So, what are we gonna do today?
Mike  They have a game room downstairs! Ping pong and stuff.
Monica  (pleasantly surprised) Ping pong? (to Chandler) Honey, they have ping pong! Let's play!
Chandler  I don't think so!
Monica  (disappointed) Why not?
Chandler  Because you know how competitive you get and well, I say it's cute, others disagree, and I'm lying!
Monica  I'm not always that bad!
Chandler  Oh, yeah? What happened when we played last time?
Monica  (hesitatingly) I punched you...?
Chandler  And...?
Monica  ... Phoebe...?
Phoebe  ... and...?
Monica  I clunked your heads together!
[Scene  Joey and Charlie's room]
Charlie  (walking in) Hey! There you are!
Joey  Hey! (stands up) As soon as it stops raining we have got to go snorkeling! Some kid told me about the sea turtle and, if you blow bubbles in its face, it chases ya! (smiles ecstatic)
Charlie  I'm sorry, I can't! I'm running a discussion group all afternoon.
Joey  (disappointed) Oh... oh, but that's ok, I'll find someone else to do it... I'll do it alone, but... I don't know what happens if the sea turtle catches you...
Charlie  You know... I feel so bad! I haven't seen you this whole trip and (pauses) especially last night...
Joey  (interrupting her) Hey! Don't worry about it! It was fine! I ended up having the best time with Rachel! I just felt bad for you, stuck in that room, working on Ross's speech... (pulls a face)
Charlie  Actually, it turned out to be a lot of fun!
Joey  (bewildered) Oh! Oh, well! At least we're both having fun!
Charlie  Yeah...
Charlie  ... is it weird that it's not with each other?
Joey  Yeah! A little bit, yeah...
Charlie  (sitting down on the bed) I think we need to talk...!
Joey  Yeah... I think we do... (sighs, with folded arms)... about what?
[Scene  the hotel game room. There is a ping pong table in the middle of the room. Monica, Phoebe, Chandler and Mike walk in]
Monica  C'mon guys, it'll be fun!
Phoebe  All right, all right... I'll play if we don't keep score!
Monica  But then how do we know who wins?
Phoebe  Nobody wins!
Monica  So, we're just four losers... SUPER!
Chandler  I'm not playing with you.
Phoebe  Yeah, I'm out.
Mike  I'll play ya!
Monica  (smiling) OK!
Phoebe  Mike, you don't know, you don't know what you're doing!
Chandler  She gets crazy! This scar (points to his forehead) is from Pictionary!
Mike  (disbelieving) I think I will be all right! (to Monica) You wanna volley a bit for a serve?
Monica  Sure! Got to!
Monica  Aww!
Mike  Oh, by the way... I'm awesome!!
Chandler  (nearly whispering) Oh dear God, there's two of them!
Mike  You're ready to play?
Monica  Hell, yeah!
Chandler  (to Phoebe) Did you know this about him?
Phoebe  No idea! I though he was soft like you!
Mike  Wanna make it more interesting?
Monica  How much were you thinking?
Mike  Ten bucks a game?
Monica  Make it fifty!
Mike  I'll make it a hundred!
Monica  (nearly shouting) One thousand...
Chandler  (interrupting her) OK!
Mike  To see who goes first, you got a quarter?
Monica  (going through her pockets) No... (to Chandler and Phoebe) Either of you girls got a quarter?
Chandler  Honey, try to focus the trash talk on him!
Phoebe  (picks up a coin from her bra) Monica, you call it.
Monica  Heads! No, Tails! He-he-heads!
Phoebe  Tails!
Monica  (angry) Ow, what are the chances!
Monica  Ha! My point!
Mike  Oh, no! I don't think so! You know, according to standard table tennis rules if at any time a player uses his non racket bearing hand to touch the playing surface he or she forfeits the point.
Phoebe  (smiling proudly) He was a lawyer!
[Scene  Rachel's hotel room. She is watching the Weather Channel on TV.]
Alexandra Steele  (meteorologist) (pointing to the East Coast)... all these coasts having beautiful weather. In New York, it's 72 and sunny!
Rachel  Oh! Weather bitch! (turns the TV off)
Rachel  It's open! (Joey walks in) Hi, Joe!
Joey  (downhearted) Hey...
Rachel  (worried) What, is everything ok?
Joey  Uh... Charlie and I broke up.
Rachel  Nooooo, why?
Joey  Oh well, she said we have nothing in common.
Rachel  (laughing) Oh, that's crazy!
Joey  No, it's not, we have nothing in common!
Rachel  ... yeah, it's true.
Joey  I mean, she should be with someone like... Ross! You know what I mean, he uses all those big words too! Man, smart people are dull!
Rachel  (pretending to be offended) What, hey!
Joey  (laughing sarcastically) Ok, Rach!
Joey  I feel so stupid, you know? Why... why do I keep going after the wrong girls?
Rachel  W-What are you, what are you talking about?
Joey  Oh, c'mon, I mean, there's you, then there's Charlie, and it's like... (sighs) What the hell is my problem? OH! (He falls back on the bed)
Rachel  Ok... uh... maybe you're not always going after the wrong girl...
Joey  (sitting up again) I'm telling you, Rach, Charlie is not right for me!
Rachel  Yeah, I'm not talking about her...
Joey  But then who? The waitress I went out with last month? (gives her a meaningful look)
Rachel  You know? Forget it!
Joey  (stands up) No-no-no-no, no! Who, who were you talking about?
Rachel  No, I-I-I-I don't, I actually don't know who I'm talking about! So!
Joey  Ok! All right, well... I'm gonna see if I can get a room for the night and I'll... I'll see you later!
Rachel  Yeah, sure!
[Scene  Rachel's hotel room. Joey is standing at the door, facing Rachel]
Joey  You like me? (shuts the door)
Rachel  (nearly whispering) Ok, let's not make a big thing about this!
Joey  (shocked) That's a huge thing!
Joey  What... for how long?
Rachel  Only like a month!
Joey  (outraged) A MONTH??
Rachel  What the... DIAL IT DOWN! (Joey goes to sit on the bed) Listen, ok, and maybe they're crazy thoughts, but sometimes I do, I have, I've been thinking about... you know, us! (looks at Joey, who's totally distraught) Ok, dial it up a little!
Joey  (stands up) I just have one question!
Rachel  Shoot!
Joey  (desperate) What the hell are you doin'???
Rachel  I don't know, I'm not trying to do anything, it's just, we have such a good time when we're together, you know... I mean, aren't you just a... little curious... (insinuating) what that would be like?...
Joey  Uh, am I curious? I mean, I am as curious as... as... George!!
Rachel  (puzzled) Who...?
Joey  CURIOUS GEORGE (see link)! You know, the monkey, and the guy with the yellow hat!
Rachel  Oh yes, of course, I remember him!
Joey  Yeah, he had a paper route.
Rachel  Yeah, he did! (smiling) Oh, see, this is what I'm talking about!
Joey  No, I know, yeah I know we're great but Rach no... this... this can't happen!
Rachel  But can it... just... happen a little bit?
Joey  (charmed, but then recoiling) NO, NO! It can't happen at all!
Rachel  But why, why not?
Joey  Because... look, no one wants this to happen more than me, ok? (in a trembling voice) I have gone over this moment in my head a hundred times and not once did I ever say no! (sighs) I couldn't do it to Ross!
Rachel  But that wasn't gonna stop you before!
Joey  I know, I know! But I've thought about it a lot since, and it just wouldn't be right... (painfully) I'm sorry...!
Rachel  (regretful) I'm sorry, too! (they look at each other sadly, then she recollects, and puts her hands over her eyes) OH GOD! I shouldn't have said anything!
Rachel  It's not a big deal!
Joey  NO BIG DEAL!
Rachel  It's so not a big deal!
Joey  Yeah! I'll see ya later! Yeah!
Rachel  Ok!
Rachel  Ok, I...
Rachel  AAAHHHH!
[Scene  the hotel game room. Monica and Mike are still playing ping pong]
Monica  Ooh! I'm sorry! I think, I THINK, that may have missed the table!
Mike  Do you?
Monica  Ah, yeah!
Mike  Do you?
Monica  Ah, yeaaah!
Mike  DO YOU?
Monica  AH YEAAAAH!
Chandler  (to Phoebe) Do you really find this attractive on him?
Phoebe  (looking at Mike) Oh, yeah! (turning to Chandler) Are you telling me you... you're not even... a little turned on by Monica, right now?
Chandler  I think this is the first time in our marriage that I've felt like the more attractive one.
Phoebe  C'mon Mike, you can beat her! Knock that dog off her head!
Monica  Oh, damn it!
Phoebe  (pointing at Mike and shouting) I sleep with him!
Mike  (boasting) Game, point!
Monica  (threatening) Don't get too cocky! Remember I won the last one! Oh, by the way, how did that feel, losing to a girl?
Mike  You know, you should really look in a mirror before you call yourself that.
Monica  NO, NO, NOOO!
Mike  And that's how it's done! (Phoebe kisses him)
Chandler  Okay-dokay, you've each won a game and I've lost what's felt like a year of my life. So everybody goes home a winner.
Monica  Best out of three?
Mike  That's what I'm thinking.
Chandler  Should I use my invisibility to fight crime or for evil?
Monica  (to Mike) Serve the ball, chump!
Phoebe  (to Mike) Ok Mike, better come back Mike, better come back.
[Scene  hotel's bar, Ross and Mr. Oberblau are talking]
Mr. Oberblau  I'm just saying, I have a cabin in the Adirondacks if you ever want to get away from the city, well, that'd be (pause) just nifty!
Ross  Ooh, well. Ah, I kinda have got a lot on my plate right now, not that I wouldn't love a weekend in the country with a strange man. (Mr. Oberblau giggles)
Woman  Jarvis?
Mr. Oberblau  (seeing her) Oh, you're back... (to Ross) this is my wife, Nancy.
Ross  Get Out!
Charlie  Ross, can I talk to you for a minute?
Ross  Yes, please! (they move and sit down on a sofa) So, what's going on?
Charlie  Uh, well... Joey and I broke up.
Ross  Oh my God, wh-what happened?
Charlie  Joey is a great guy, but we're just... so different! I mean, during your speech he kept laughing at homo erectus!
Ross  I knew that was him!
Charlie  Anyway I just, uh, I think it's for the best.
Ross  (holding her hand) Hey, you ok?
Charlie  I guess. There was hum... (she breathes deeply) there was another reason that I thought it was time to end it with Joey. I started to realize that I was having feelings for someone (pause) else.
Paleontologist  (merrily) Ok Geller. Last day of the conference, you know what happens to the keynote speaker.
Ross  Oh, professor Clerk we're kind of in the middle of a conversation, here.
Charlie  Yeah, can you guys just throw him in the pool later?
Professore Clerk  Or we could throw you both in now!
Ross  (standing) Ok, gentlemen! Please! Aren't we a little old for this? I mean, we're scientists, right? We're academics. And most importantly I... you-you will have to catch us first. (he starts to run away with Charlie). GO, GO, GO! (the paleontologists starts chasing them)
[Scene  game room, Monica and Mike are still playing ping pong]
Mike  Ok, so it's a tie again, 41 to 41.
Chandler  (exhausted) Ok, look! Enough is enough!
Monica  No, I have just to have two more points to beat him!
Chandler  Monica, that was also true an hour ago! I mean, please, look at you! Your hand is blistered, you can barely stand, your hair is inexplicable! Ok, you've already proven you are just as good as he is, now we've missed our dinner reservations, so now let's just go upstairs, order room service, take a shower and shave your head!
Monica  I can't just walk away! I've put in four hours!
Chandler  But...
Monica  Look! You knew this about me when you married me! You agreed to take me in sickness and in health. Well, this is my sickness!
Chandler  What about the obsessive cleaning?
Monica  That's just good sense!
Monica  (in pain) Aww! (she holds her hand, moaning like she's biting back a scream)
Chandler  You ok?
Monica  No, no, no. Honey, I'm ok. Shake it off! (she shakes the wrist and it's more painful) Oh, no! No shaking, no shaking! Ooh! Ooh! (pause) Oh my God! I can't play!
Mike  So you forfeit?
Phoebe  Mike wins?
Monica  I can't believe it! (pause) I lost!
Chandler  No, you didn't.
Monica  What?
Chandler  Because I'm gonna play for ya.
Phoebe  You can't do that!
Mike  Oh, that's ok. I don't care which of them I beat.
Phoebe  Ok, we're taking that paddle home, mister.
Monica  (to Chandler) Honey, you don't have to do this.
Chandler  (In a loving voice) Yes, I do. Now, I may not understand why you have to win so badly, but if it's important to you then it's important to me, because I love you.
Monica  But... you suck!
Chandler  (Still in a loving voice) You're welcome, sweetheart.
Chandler  All right Mike, let's get this over with. Sudden death. Whoever wins this point, wins.
Mike  Ok!
Monica  Oh my God! You're good!
Phoebe  It's like watching porn!
Chandler  And that's... how... it's done!
Monica  (to Chandler) Oh my God. That was so amazing! When did you (pause) Hold on! I almost forgot (she turns to Mike) loser! (back to Chandler) When did you stop sucking?
Chandler  I never sucked, I actually didn't want you to know how good I was!
Monica  Why?
Chandler  I don't know.
Monica  This is so great! Now we can enter into doubles tournaments!
Chandler  That's why!
[Scene  Hotel's bar. Ross is running to Charlie trying not to be seen with two cocktails in his hands. She's hidden behind a huge plant]
Charlie  Thanks!
Ross  Hi.
Charlie  Are they still looking for us?
Ross  Yeah. The bartender said that they split up into two search parties, the herbivores and the carnivores. (pause) You know, we as a group are not the coolest.
Ross  I don't think they saw us.
Charlie  I don't think they did.
Charlie  Hum, so, I started to say you something earlier, hum... (pause) There was another reason I realized it was time to end it with Joey. I kind of realized I... was starting to have feelings... for someone else.
Ross  (apparently unruffled) Oh. Can I... can I ask who?
Charlie  I think you know.
Ross  I think I know too but I've been really wrong about this stuff in the past, so...
Ross  I'm sorry... we... we can't.
Charlie  All right, all right.
Ross  I mean, you just went out with my best friend, and I just think it'd be a really really bad idea. (pause) Or-or not! (they kiss passionately)
Rachel  What?
