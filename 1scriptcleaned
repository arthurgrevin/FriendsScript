Monica  There's nothing to tell! He's just some guy
I work with!
Joey  C'mon, you're going out with the guy! There's
gotta be something wrong with him!
Chandler  All right Joey, be
nice.  So does he have a hump? A hump and a hairpiece?
Phoebe  Wait, does he eat chalk?
Phoebe  Just, 'cause, I don't want her to go through
what I went through with Carl- oh!
Monica  Okay, everybody relax. This is not even a
date. It's just two people going out to dinner and- not having sex.
Chandler  Sounds like a date to me.
Chandler  Alright, so I'm back in high school, I'm
standing in the middle of the cafeteria, and I realize I am totally naked.
All  Oh, yeah. Had that dream.
Chandler  Then I look down, and I realize there's a
phone... there.
Joey  Instead of...?
Chandler  That's right.
Joey  Never had that dream.
Phoebe  No.
Chandler  All of a sudden, the phone starts to ring.
Now I don't know what to do, everybody starts looking at me.
Monica  And they weren't looking at
you before?!
Chandler  Finally, I figure
I'd better answer it, and it turns out it's my mother,
which is very-very weird, because- she never calls me!
Ross  (mortified) Hi.
Joey  This guy says hello, I wanna kill myself.
Monica  Are you okay, sweetie?
Ross  I just feel like someone reached down my
throat, grabbed my small intestine, pulled it out of my mouth and tied it around my
neck...
Chandler  Cookie?
Monica  (explaining to the others) Carol moved her
stuff out today.
Joey  Ohh.
Monica  (to Ross) Let me get you some coffee.
Ross  Thanks.
Phoebe  Ooh! Oh! (She starts to pluck at the air
just in front of Ross.)
Ross  No, no don't! Stop cleansing my aura! No, just
leave my aura alone, okay?
Phoebe  Fine!  Be murky!
Ross  I'll be fine,
alright? Really, everyone. I hope she'll be very happy.
Monica  No you don't.
Ross  No I don't, to hell with her, she left me!
Joey  And you never knew she was a lesbian...
Ross  No!! Okay?! Why does everyone keep fixating on
that? She didn't know, how should I know?
Chandler  Sometimes I wish I was a lesbian... (They
all stare at him.) Did I say that out loud?
Ross  I told mom and dad last night,
they seemed to take it pretty well.
Ross  Sorry.
Joey  Alright Ross, look. You're feeling a lot of
pain right now. You're angry. You're hurting. Can I tell you what the answer is?
Joey  Strip joint! C'mon, you're single! Have some
hormones!
Ross  I don't want to be single, okay? I just... I
just- I just wanna be married again!
Chandler  And I just want a million dollars! (He
extends his hand hopefully.)
Monica  Rachel?!
Rachel  Oh God Monica hi! Thank God! I just went to
your building and you weren't there and then this guy with a big hammer said you might be
here and you are, you are!
Waitress  Can I get you some coffee?
Monica  (pointing at Rachel) De-caff. (to All) Okay,
everybody, this is Rachel, another Lincoln High survivor. (to Rachel) This is everybody,
this is Chandler, and Phoebe, and Joey, and- you remember my brother Ross?
Rachel  Hi, sure!
Ross  Hi.
Monica  So you wanna tell us now, or are we waiting
for four wet bridesmaids?
Monica  Who wasn't invited to the wedding.
Monica  Now I'm guessing that he bought her the big
pipe organ, and she's really not happy about it.
Chandler  (imitating the characters)
Tuna or egg salad?  Decide!
Ross  (in a deep voice) I'll have
whatever Christine is having.
Rachel  (on phone) Daddy, I just... I can't marry
him! I'm sorry. I just don't love him. Well, it matters to me!
Phoebe   If I let go of
my hair, my head will fall off.
Chandler  (re TV) Ooh, she should not be wearing
those pants.
Joey  I say push her down the stairs.
Phoebe, Ross, Chandler, and Joey  
Push her down the stairs! Push her down the stairs! Push her down the stairs!
Rachel  C'mon Daddy, listen to me! It's like, it's
like, all of my life, everyone has always told me, 'You're a shoe! You're a shoe, you're a
shoe, you're a shoe!'. And today I just stopped and I said, 'What if I don't wanna be a
shoe? What if I wanna be a- a purse, y'know? Or a- or a hat! No, I'm not saying I want you
to buy me a hat, I'm saying I am a ha- It's a metaphor, Daddy!
Ross  You can see where he'd have trouble.
Rachel  Look Daddy, it's my life. Well maybe I'll
just stay here with Monica.
Monica  Well, I guess we've established who's
staying here with Monica...
Rachel  Well, maybe that's my decision. Well, maybe
I don't need your money. Wait!! Wait, I said maybe!!
Monica  Just breathe, breathe.. that's it. Just try
to think of nice calm things...
Phoebe  (sings) Raindrops on roses and rabbits and
kittens, (Rachel and Monica turn to look at her.) bluebells and sleighbells and- something
with mittens... La la la la...something and noodles with
string.  These are a few...
Rachel  I'm all better now.
Phoebe  (grins and walks to the kitchen and says to
Chandler and Joey.) I helped!
Monica  Okay, look, this is probably for the best,
y'know? Independence. Taking control of your life.  The whole,
'hat' thing.
Joey  (comforting her) And hey, you need anything,
you can always come to Joey. Me and Chandler live across the hall. And he's away a lot.
Monica  Joey, stop hitting on her! It's her wedding
day!
Joey  What, like there's a rule or something?
Chandler  Please don't do that again, it's a
horrible sound.
Paul  (over the intercom) It's, uh,
it's Paul.
Joey  Who's Paul?
Ross  Paul the Wine Guy, Paul?
Ross  He finally asked you out?
Monica  Yes!
Chandler  Ooh, this is a Dear Diary moment.
Monica  Rach, wait, I can cancel...
Rachel  Please, no, go, that'd be fine!
Monica  (to Ross) Are, are you okay? I mean, do you
want me to stay?
Ross  (choked voice) That'd be good...
Monica  (horrified) Really?
Ross  (normal voice) No, go on! It's Paul the Wine
Guy!
Phoebe  What does that mean?  
Does he sell it, drink it, or just complain a lot? (Chandler doesn't know.)
Monica  Hi, come in! Paul, this is.. (They are all
lined up next to the door.)... everybody, everybody, this is Paul.
All  Hey! Paul! Hi! The Wine Guy! Hey!
Chandler  I'm sorry, I didn't catch your name. Paul,
was it?
Monica  Okay, umm-umm, I'll
just--I'll be right back, I just gotta go ah, go ah...
Ross  A wandering?
Monica  Change!  Okay,
sit down. (Shows Paul in) Two seconds.
Phoebe  Ooh, I just pulled out four eyelashes. That
can't be good.
Joey   Hey, Paul!
Paul  Yeah?
Joey  Here's a little tip, she
really likes it when you rub her neck in the same spot over and over and over again until
it starts to get a little red.
Monica  (yelling from the bedroom)
Shut up, Joey!
Ross  So Rachel, what're you, uh... what're you up
to tonight?
Rachel  Well, I was kinda supposed to be headed for
Aruba on my honeymoon, so nothing!
Ross  Right, you're not even getting your honeymoon,
God.. No, no, although, Aruba, this time of year... talk about your- (thinks) -big
lizards... Anyway, if you don't feel like being alone tonight, Joey and Chandler are
coming over to help me put together my new furniture.
Chandler  (deadpan) Yes, and we're very excited
about it.
Rachel  Well actually thanks, but I think I'm just
gonna hang out here tonight.  It's been kinda a long day.
Ross  Okay, sure.
Joey  Hey Pheebs, you wanna help?
Phoebe  Oh, I wish I could, but I don't want to.
[Scene  The Subway, Phoebe is singing for
change.]
Phoebe  (singing) Love is sweet as
summer showers, love is a wondrous work of art, but your love oh your love, your love...is
like a giant pigeon...crapping on my heart.  La-la-la-la-la- (some guy gives her some
change and to that guy) Thank you. (sings) La-la-la-la...ohhh!
[Scene  Ross's Apartment, the guys are there assembling
furniture.]
Ross  (squatting and reading the instructions) I'm
supposed to attach a brackety thing to the side things, using a bunch of these little worm
guys. I have no brackety thing, I see no whim guys whatsoever and- I cannot feel my legs.
Joey  I'm thinking we've got a
bookcase here.
Chandler  It's a beautiful thing.
Joey  (picking up a leftover part) What's this?
Chandler  I would have to
say that is an 'L'-shaped bracket.
Joey  Which goes where?
Chandler  I have no
idea.
Joey  Done with the bookcase!
Chandler  All finished!
Ross  (clutching a beer can and sniffing) This was
Carol's favorite beer. She always drank it out of the can, I should have known.
Joey  Hey-hey-hey-hey, if you're
gonna start with that stuff we're outta here.
Chandler  Yes, please don't spoil
all this fun.
Joey  Ross, let me ask you a question. She got the
furniture, the stereo, the good TV- what did you get?
Ross  You guys.
Chandler  Oh, God.
Joey  You got screwed.
Chandler  Oh my God!
[Scene  A Restaurant, Monica and Paul are eating.]
Monica  Oh my God!
Paul  I know, I know, I'm such an idiot. I guess I
should have caught on when she started going to the dentist four and five times a week. I
mean, how clean can teeth get?
Monica  My brother's going through that right now,
he's such a mess. How did you get through it?
Paul  Well, you might try accidentally breaking
something valuable of hers, say her-
Monica  -leg?
Paul  (laughing) That's one way! Me, I- I went for
the watch.
Monica  You actually broke her watch?  Wow!  The worst thing I ever did was, I-I shredded by
boyfriend's favorite bath towel.
Paul  Ooh, steer clear of you.
Rachel  Barry, I'm sorry... I am so sorry... I know
you probably think that this is all about what I said the other day about you making love
with your socks on, but it isn't... it isn't, it's about me, and I ju- (She stops talking
and dials the phone.) Hi, machine cut me off again... anyway...look,
look, I know that some girl is going to be incredibly lucky to become Mrs. Barry Finkel,
but it isn't me, it's not me.  And not that I have any idea who me is right now, but
you just have to give me a chance too... (The maching cuts her off again and she redials.)
[Scene  Ross's Apartment; Ross is pacing while Joey and
Chandler are working on some more furniture.]
Ross  I'm divorced!  I'm only
26 and I'm divorced!
Joey  Shut up!
Chandler  You must stop! (Chandler
hits what he is working on with a hammer and it collapses.)
Ross  That only took me an hour.
Chandler  Look, Ross, you gotta
understand, between us we haven't had a relationship that has lasted longer than a Mento.
  You, however have had the love of a woman for four years.  
Four years of closeness and sharing at the end of which she ripped your heart out, and
that is why we don't do it!  I don't think that was my point!
Ross  You know what the scariest part is? What if
there's only one woman for everybody, y'know? I mean what if you get one woman- and that's
it? Unfortunately in my case, there was only one woman- for her...
Joey  What are you talking about? 'One woman'?
That's like saying there's only one flavor of ice cream for you. Lemme tell you something,
Ross. There's lots of flavors out there. There's Rocky Road, and Cookie Dough, and Bing!
Cherry Vanilla. You could get 'em with Jimmies, or nuts, or whipped cream! This is the
best thing that ever happened to you! You got married, you were, like, what, eight?
Welcome back to the world! Grab a spoon!
Ross  I honestly don't know if I'm hungry or horny.
Paul  Ever since she walked out on me, I, uh...
Monica  What?..... What, you wanna spell it out with
noodles?
Paul  No, it's, it's more of a fifth date kinda
revelation.
Monica  Oh, so there is gonna be a fifth date?
Paul  Isn't there?
Monica  Yeah... yeah, I think there is. -What were
you gonna say?
Paul  Well, ever-ev-... ever since she left me, um,
I haven't been able to, uh, perform. (Monica takes a sip of her drink.) ...Sexually.
Monica  (spitting out her drink in shock) Oh God, oh
God, I am sorry... I am so sorry...
Paul  It's okay...
Monica  I know being spit on is probably not what
you need right now. Um... how long?
Paul  Two years.
Monica  Wow! I'm-I'm-I'm glad you smashed her watch!
Paul  So you still think you, um... might want that
fifth date?
Monica  (pause)...Yeah. Yeah, I do.
[Scene  Monica's Apartment, Rachel is watching Joanne
Loves Chaci.]
Priest on TV 
We are gathered here today to join Joanne Louise Cunningham and
Charles, Chachi-Chachi-Chachi, Arcola in the bound of holy matrimony.
Rachel  Oh...see... but Joanne loved Chachi! That's
the difference!
[Scene  Ross's Apartment, they're all sitting around and
talking.]
Ross  (scornful) Grab a spoon. Do you know how long
it's been since I've grabbed a spoon? Do the words 'Billy, don't be a hero' mean anything
to you?
Joey  Great story!  But, I uh,
I gotta go, I got a date with Andrea--Angela--Andrea...  Oh man, (looks to Chandler)
Chandler  Angela's the screamer,
Andrea has cats.
Joey  Right.  Thanks. 
It's June.  I'm outta here. (Exits.)
Ross  Y'know, here's the thing. Even if I could get
it together enough to- to ask a woman out,... who am I gonna ask? (He gazes out of the
window.)
[Scene  Monica's Apartment, Rachel is making coffee for
Joey and Chandler.]
Rachel  Isn't this amazing? I mean, I have never
made coffee before in my entire life.
Chandler  That is amazing.
Joey  Congratulations.
Rachel  Y'know, I figure if I can
make coffee, there isn't anything I can't do.
Chandler  If can invade Poland,
there isn't anything I can't do.
Joey  Listen, while you're on a roll, if you feel
like you gotta make like a Western omelet or something... (Joey and Chandler taste the
coffee, grimace, and pour it into a plant pot.) Although actually I'm really not that
hungry...
Monica  (entering, to herself) Oh
good, Lenny and Squigy are here.
All  Morning. Good morning.
Paul  (entering from Monica's room)
Morning.
Joey  Morning, Paul.
Rachel  Hello, Paul.
Chandler  Hi, Paul, is it?
Paul  Thank you!  Thank you so
much!
Monica  Stop!
Paul  No, I'm telling you last night
was like umm, all my birthdays, both graduations, plus the barn raising scene in Witness.
Monica  We'll talk later.
Paul  Yeah. (They kiss) Thank you. (Exits)
Joey  That wasn't a real date?! What the hell do you
do on a real date?
Monica  Shut up, and put my table back.
All  Okayyy! (They do so.)
Chandler  All right, kids, I gotta get to work. If I
don't input those numbers,... it doesn't make much of a difference...
Rachel  So, like, you guys all have jobs?
Monica  Yeah, we all have jobs. See, that's how we
buy stuff.
Joey  Yeah, I'm an actor.
Rachel  Wow! Would I have seen you in anything?
Joey  I doubt it. Mostly regional work.
Monica  Oh wait, wait, unless you happened to catch
the Reruns' production of Pinocchio, at the little theater in the
park.
Joey  Look, it was a job all right?
Chandler  'Look, Gippetto, I'm a real live boy.'
Joey  I will not take this abuse. (Walks to the door
and opens it to leave.)
Chandler  You're right, I'm sorry. (Burst into song
and dances out of the door.) "Once I was a wooden boy, a little wooden boy..."
Joey  You should both know,
that he's a dead man.  Oh, Chandler? (Starts after Chandler.)
Monica  So how you doing today? Did you sleep okay?
Talk to Barry? I can't stop smiling.
Rachel  I can see that. You look like you slept with
a hanger in your mouth.
Monica  I know, he's just so, so... Do you remember
you and Tony DeMarco?
Rachel  Oh, yeah.
Monica  Well, it's like that. With feelings.
Rachel  Oh wow. Are you in trouble.
Monica  Big time!
Rachel  Want a wedding dress?  
Hardly used.
Monica  I think we are getting
a little ahead of selves here. Okay. Okay. I am just going to get up, go to work
and not think about him all day. Or else I'm just gonna get up and go to work.
Rachel  Oh, look, wish me luck!
Monica  What for?
Rachel  I'm gonna go get one of those (Thinks) job
things.
[Scene  Iridium, Monica is working as Frannie enters.]
Frannie  Hey, Monica!
Monica  Hey Frannie, welcome back! How was Florida?
Frannie  You had sex, didn't you?
Monica  How do you do that?
Frannie  Oh, I hate you, I'm pushing my Aunt Roz through
Parrot Jungle and you're having sex!  So? Who?
Monica  You know Paul?
Frannie  Paul the Wine Guy? Oh yeah, I know Paul.
Monica  You mean you know Paul like I know Paul?
Frannie  Are you kidding? I take credit for Paul. Y'know before me, there was no
snap in his turtle for two years.
[Scene  Central Perk, everyone but Rachel is there.]
Joey  (sitting on the arm of the couch)Of course it was a line!
Monica  Why?! Why? Why, why would anybody do something like that?
Ross  I assume we're looking for an answer more sophisticated than 'to get you
into bed'.
Monica  I hate men!  I hate men!
Phoebe  Oh no, don't hate, you don't
want to put that out into the universe.
Monica  Is it me? Is it like I have some sort of
beacon that only dogs and men with severe emotional problems can hear?
Phoebe  All right, c'mere, gimme your feet. (She starts massaging them.)
Monica  I just thought he was nice, y'know?
Joey  (bursts out laughing again) I can't believe you didn't know it was a line!
Rachel  Guess what?
Ross  You got a job?
Rachel  Are you kidding? I'm trained for nothing! I was laughed out of twelve
interviews today.
Chandler  And yet you're surprisingly upbeat.
Rachel  You would be too if you found John and David boots on sale, fifty
percent off!
Chandler  Oh, how well you know me...
Rachel  They're my new 'I don't need a job, I don't need my parents, I've got
great boots' boots!
Monica  How'd you pay for them?
Rachel  Uh, credit card.
Monica  And who pays for that?
Rachel  Um... my... father.
[Scene  Monica and Rachel's, everyone is sitting around the kitchen table.  
Rachel's credit cards are spread out on the table along with a pair of scissors.]
Rachel  Oh God, come on you
guys, is this really necessary?  I mean, I can stop charging anytime I want.
Monica  C'mon, you can't live off your parents your whole life.
Rachel  I know that. That's why I was getting married.
Phoebe  Give her a break, it's hard being on your own for the first time.
Rachel  Thank you.
Phoebe  You're welcome. I remember when I first came to this city. I was
fourteen. My mom had just killed herself and my step-dad was back in prison, and I got
here, and I didn't know anybody. And I ended up living with this albino guy who was, like,
cleaning windshields outside port authority, and then he killed himself, and then I found
aromatherapy. So believe me, I know exactly how you feel.
Ross  The word you're looking for is 'Anyway'...
Monica  All right, you ready?
Rachel  No.  No, no, I'm not
ready!  How can I be ready?  "Hey, Rach!  You ready to jump out the
airplane without your parachute?"  Come on, I can't do this!
Monica  You can, I know you
can!
Rachel  I don't think so.
Ross  Come on, you made
coffee!   You can do anything! (Chandler slowly tries to hide the now dead plant from
that morning when he and Joey poured their coffee into it.)
Ross  C'mon, cut. Cut, cut, cut,...
All  Cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, cut... (She cuts one of them and they cheer.)
Rachel  Y'know what?  I think
we can just leave it at that.  It's kinda like a symbolic gesture...
Monica   Rachel! 
That was a library card!
All  Cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, cut..
Chandler  (as Rachel is cutting up
her cards) Y'know, if you listen closely, you can hear a thousand retailers scream.
Monica  Welcome to the real world! It sucks. You're
gonna love it!
Monica  Well, that's it (To Ross) You gonna crash on the couch?
Ross  No. No, I gotta go home sometime.
Monica  You be okay?
Ross  Yeah.
Rachel  Hey Mon, look what I just found on the floor. (Monica smiles.) What?
Monica  That's Paul's watch. You just put it back where you found it. Oh boy.
Alright. Goodnight, everybody.
Ross and Rachel  Goodnight.
Ross  Mmm. (They both reach for the last cookie) Oh, no-
Rachel  Sorry-
Ross  No no no, go-
Rachel  No, you have it, really, I don't want it-
Ross  Split it?
Rachel  Okay.
Ross  Okay. (They split it.) You know you probably didn't know this, but back in
high school, I had a, um, major crush on you.
Rachel  I knew.
Ross  You did! Oh.... I always figured you just thought I was Monica's geeky
older brother.
Rachel  I did.
Ross  Oh. Listen, do you think- and try not to let my intense vulnerability
become any kind of a factor here- but do you think it would be okay if I asked you out?
Sometime? Maybe?
Rachel  Yeah, maybe...
Ross  Okay... okay, maybe I will...
Rachel  Goodnight.
Ross  Goodnight.
Monica  See ya.... Waitwait, what's with you?
Ross  I just grabbed a spoon. (Ross exits and Monica has no idea what that
means.)
[Scene  Central Perk, everyone is there.]
Joey  I can't believe what I'm hearing here.
Phoebe  (sings) I can't believe what I'm hearing here...
Monica  What? I-I said you had a-
Phoebe  (sings) What I said you had...
Monica  (to Phoebe) Would you stop?
Phoebe  Oh, was I doing it again?
All  Yes!
Monica  I said that you had a nice
butt, it's just not a great butt.
Joey  Oh, you wouldn't know a great
butt if it came up and bit ya.
Ross  There's an image.
Rachel  (walks up with a pot of coffee) Would anybody like more coffee?
Chandler  Did you make it, or are you just serving it?
Rachel  I'm just serving it.
All  Yeah. Yeah, I'll have a cup of coffee.
Chandler  Kids, new dream... I'm in Las Vegas. (Rachel
sits down to hear Chandler's dream.)
Customer  (To
Rachel) Ahh, miss?   More coffee?
Rachel  Ugh. (To another customer that's leaving.) Excuse me, could you give
this to that guy over there? (Hands him the coffee pot.) Go ahead. (He does so.) Thank
you. (To the gang.) Sorry.  Okay, Las Vegas.
Chandler  Okay, so, I'm in Las
Vegas... I'm Liza Minelli-
Monica  What you guys don't understand is, for us,
kissing is as important as any part of it.
Joey  Yeah, right!.......Y'serious?
Phoebe  Oh, yeah!
Rachel  Everything you need to know is in that first kiss.
Monica  Absolutely.
Chandler  Yeah, I think for us, kissing is pretty much like an opening act,
y'know? I mean it's like the stand-up comedian you have to sit through before Pink Floyd
comes out.
Ross  Yeah, and-and it's not that we don't like the comedian, it's that-that...
that's not why we bought the ticket.
Chandler  The problem is, though, after the concert's over, no matter how great
the show was, you girls are always looking for the comedian again, y'know? I mean, we're
in the car, we're fighting traffic... basically just trying to stay awake.
Joey  (pause)....Are we still talking about sex?
[Scene  Museum of Prehistoric History, Ross and a co-worker
(Marsha) are setting up an exhibit which includes some mannequins of cave people.]
Ross  No, it's good, it is good, it's just that- mm- doesn't she seem a little
angry?
Marsha  Well, she has issues.
Ross  Does she.
Marsha  He's out banging other women over the head with a club, while she sits
at home trying to get the mastodon smell out of the carpet!
Ross  Marsha, these are cave people. Okay? They have issues like 'Gee, that
glacier's getting kinda close.' See?
Marsha  Speaking of issues, isn't that your ex-wife?
Ross  (trying to ignore her) No. No.
Marsha  Yes, it is. Carol! Hi!
Ross  Okay, okay, yes, it is. (waves) How about I'll, uh, catch up with you in
the Ice Age.
Ross Hi.
Carol  So.
Ross  You look great. I, uh... I hate that.
Carol  Sorry. You look good too.
Ross  Ah, well, in here, anyone who... stands erect... So what's new? Still,
uh...
Carol  A lesbian?
Ross  Well... you never know. How's, um.. how's the family?
Carol  Marty's still totally paranoid. Oh, and, uh-
Ross  Why- why are you here, Carol?
Carol  I'm pregnant.
Ross  Pregnant?!
[Scene  Monica and Rachel's, Chandler, Joey, Phoebe, and Monica are watching Three's
Company.]
Chandler  Oh, I think this is the episode of Three's
Company where there's some kind of misunderstanding.
Phoebe ...Then I've already seen this one! (Turns off the TV.)
Monica  (taking a drink from Joey) Are you through with that?
Joey  Yeah, sorry, the swallowing slowed me down.
Monica  Whose little ball of paper is this?!
Chandler  Oh, uh, that would be mine. See, I wrote a note to myself, and then I
realised I didn't need it, so I balled it up and... (sees that Monica is glaring at him)
...now I wish I was dead.
Phoebe  She's already fluffed that pillow... Monica, you know, you've already
fluffed that- (Monica glares at her.) -but, it's fine!
Monica  Look , I'm sorry, guys, I just don't wanna give them any more ammunition
than they already have.
Chandler  Yes, and we all know how cruel a parent can be about the flatness of a
child's pillow.
Phoebe  Monica- Hi! Um, Monica, you're scaring me. I mean, you're like, you're
like all chaotic and twirly. And not-not in a good way.
Joey  Yeah, calm down. You don't see Ross getting all chaotic and twirly every
time they come.
Monica  That's because as far as my parents are concerned, Ross can do no wrong.
Y'see, he's the Prince. Apparently they had some big ceremony before I was born.
Chandler  (looking out the window) Ew, ew, ew, ew ew ew ew ew!
Monica  What?
Chandler  Ugly Naked Guy got a Thighmaster!
All  Eeaagh!
Rachel  Has anybody seen my engagement ring?
Phoebe  Yeah, it's beautiful.
Rachel  Oh God, oh God, oh God oh God oh God oh God.... (Starts to look under
the couch cushions.)
Phoebe  No, look, don't touch that!
Rachel  Oh, like I wasn't dreading tomorrow enough, having to give it back to
him... 'Hi Barry! Remember me? I'm the girl in the veil who stomped on your heart in front
of your entire family!' Oh God and now I'm gonna have to return the ring, without the
ring, which makes it so much harder...
Monica  Easy Rach, we'll find it. (To all) Won't we!
Chandler and Joey  Oh! Yeah!
Joey  Alright, when'd'ya have it on last?
Phoebe  Doy! Probably right before she lost it!
Chandler  You don't get a lot of 'doy' these days...
Rachel  I know I had it this morning, and I know I had it when I was in the
kitchen with...
Chandler  ...Dinah?
Rachel  (looks at the lasagne and realizes something) Ohhhhh, don't be mad...
Monica  You didn't.
Rachel  Oh, I am sorry...
Monica  I gave you one job! (Starts to examin the lasagne through the bottom of
the glass pan.)
Rachel  Oh, but look how straight those noodles are!
Chandler  Now, Monica, you know that's not how you look for an engagement ring
in a lasagne...
Monica  (puts down the lasagne) I just... can't do it.
Chandler  Boys? We're going in.
Ross  (standing outside the door).....Hi.
Monica  Wow. That is not a happy hi.
Ross  Carol's pregnant.
Phoebe  (while everyone else is stunned) Ooh! I found it!
Monica  W-w-wh-... wha-... w-w-w-...
Ross  Yeah. Do that for another two hours, you might be where I am right about
now. (He enters.)
Chandler  Kinda puts that whole pillow thing in perspective, huh, Mon?
Rachel  Well now, how-how do you fit into this whole thing?
Ross  Well, Carol says she and Susan want me to be involved, but if I'm not
comfortable with it, I don't have to be involved.. basically it's entirely up to me.
Phoebe  She is so great! I miss her.
Monica  What does she mean by 'involved'?
Chandler  I mean presumably, the biggest part of your job is done.
Ross  Anyway, they want me to go down to this- sonogram thing with them
tomorrow.
Rachel  So what are you gonna do?
Ross  I have no idea. No matter what I do, though, I'm still gonna be a father.
Joey  .....Well, this is still ruined, right?
Mrs. Geller  Oh, Martha Ludwin's daughter is gonna call you. (Tastes a snack)
Mmm! What's that curry taste?
Monica  Curry.
Mrs. Geller  Mmmm!
Ross  I- I think they're great! I, I really do.
Mr. Geller  (To Ross) Do you remember the Ludwins? The big one had a thing for
you, didn't she?
Mrs. Geller  They all had a thing for him.
Ross  Aw, Mom...
Monica  I'm sorry, why is this girl going to call me?
Mrs. Geller  Oh, she just graduated, and she wants to be something in cooking,
or food, or.... I don't know. Anyway, I told her you had a restaurant-
Monica  No Mom, I don't have a restaurant, I work in a restaurant.
Mrs. Geller  Well, they don't have to know that... (She starts to fluff the same
pillow Monica fluffed multiple times earlier.)
Monica  Ross, could you come and help me with the spaghetti, please?
Ross  Yeah. (They go to the kitchen.)
Mrs. Geller  Oh, we're having spaghetti! That's.... easy.
Monica  I know this is going to sound unbelievably selfish, but, were you
planning on bringing up the whole baby/lesbian thing? Because I think it might take some
of the heat off me.
Mrs. Geller  What that Rachel did to her life.... We ran into her parents at the
club, they were not playing very well.
Mr. Geller  I'm not gonna tell you what they spent on that wedding... but forty
thousand dollars is a lot of money!
Mrs. Geller  Well, at least she had the chance to leave a man at the altar...
Monica  What's that supposed to mean?
Mrs. Geller  Nothing! It's an expression.
Monica  No it's not.
Mr. Geller  Don't listen to your mother. You're independent, and you always have
been! Even when you were a kid... and you were chubby, and you had no friends, you were
just fine! And you would read alone in your room, and your puzzles...
Mr. Geller  Look, there are people like Ross who
need to shoot for the stars, with his museum, and his papers getting published. Other
people are satisfied with staying where they are- I'm telling you, these are the people
who never get cancer.
Mr. Geller  ...And I read about these women trying to have it all, and I thank
God 'Our Little Harmonica' doesn't seem to have that problem.
Monica  (trying desperately to change the subject) So, Ross, what's going on
with you? Any stories? (Digs her elbow into his hand.) No news, no little anecdotes to
share with the folks?
Ross  (pulls his hand away) Okay! Okay. (To his parents) Look, I, uh- I realise
you guys have been wondering what exactly happened between Carol and me, and, so, well,
here's the deal. Carol's a lesbian. She's living with a woman named Susan. She's pregnant
with my child, and she and Susan are going to raise the baby.
Mrs. Geller  (To Monica) And you knew about this?!
[Scene  Central Park, everyone's there.]
Joey  Your folks are really that bad, huh?
Ross  Well, y'know, these people are pros. They know what they're doing, they
take their time, they get the job done.
Monica  Boy, I know they say you can't change your parents,... boy, if you
could- (To Ross) -I'd want yours.
Ross  Must pee. (Goes to pee.)
Phoebe  Y'know, it's even worse when you're twins.
Rachel  You're twins?
Phoebe  Yeah. We don't speak. She's like this high-powered, driven career type.
Chandler  What does she do?
Phoebe  She's a waitress.
Rachel  All right, you guys, I kinda gotta clean up now. (They all start to
leave.)
Monica  Chandler, you're an only child, right? You don't have any of this.
Chandler  Well, no, although I did have an imaginary friend, who... my parents
actually preferred.
Rachel  The lights, please..
Ross  ...How long was I in there?
Rachel  I'm just cleaning up.
Ross  D'ya.. uh.. d'ya need any help?
Rachel  Uh.. okay, sure! Thanks! (She hands him the broom and sits down.)
Ross  Anyway.. um.. (Starts to sweep.) So, you- uh- you nervous about Barry
tomorrow?
Rachel  Oh.. a little..
Ross  Mm-hmm..
Rachel  A lot.
Ross  Mm.
Rachel  So, got any advice? Y'know, as someone who's recently been- dumped?
Ross  Well, you may wanna steer clear of the word 'dumped'. Chances are he's
gonna be this, this broken shell of a man, y'know, so you should try not to look too
terrific, I know it'll be hard. Or, y'know, uh, hey!, I'll go down there, and I'll give
Barry back his ring, and you can go with Carol and Susan to the OB/GYN...
Rachel  Oh, you've got Carol tomorrow.. When did it get so complicated?
Ross  Got me.
Rachel  Remember when we were in high school together?
Ross  Yeah.
Rachel  I mean, didn't you think you were just gonna meet somone, fall in love-
and that'd be it? (Ross gazes at her.) ..Ross?
Ross  Yes, yes!
Rachel  Oh! Man, I never thought I'd be here.. (She leans back onto his hand.)
Ross  Me either... (He pulls up a stool so that he doesn't have to move his
hand.)
[Scene  Carol's OB/GYN, Carol is waiting.]
Ross  (entering) Sorry I'm late, I was stuck at work. There was this big
dinosaur.. thing.. anyway.
Susan  Hi.
Carol  Ross, you remember Susan.
Ross  How could I forget?
Susan  Ross.
Ross  (they shake hands) Hello, Susan. (To Carol) Good shake. Good shake. So,
uh, we're just waiting for...?
Carol  Dr. Oberman.
Ross  ..Dr. Oberman. Okay. And is he-
Susan  She.
Ross  -she, of course, she- uh- familiar with our.. special situation?
Carol  Yes, and she's very supportive.
Ross  Okay, that's great. (Susan gives her drink to Carol.) No, I'm- Oh. 
Carol  Thanks.
Ross  (picks up a surgical instrament and mimes a duck with it) Quack, quack..
Carol  Ross? That opens my cervix. (He drops it in horror.)
Rachel  Barry?
Barry  C'mon in.
Rachel  (hesitates) Are you sure?
Barry  Yeah! It's fine, it's fine. Robbie's gonna be here for hours.
Robbie  Huh?!
Barry  So, how ya doin?
Rachel  I'm- uh- I'm okay... You look great!
Barry  Yeah, well..
Bernice  (over intercom) Dr. Farber, Jason Greenstein's gagging.
Barry  (answering the intercom) Be right there. (To Robbie and Rachel) Be back
in a sec.
Rachel  I dumped him.
Robbie  Okay.
[Scene  Carol's OB/GYN, they're talking about how this is going to work.]
Ross  So, um- so how's this, uh, how's this gonna work? Y'know, with us? Y'know,
when, like, important decisions have to be made?
Carol  Give me a 'for instance'.
Ross  Well, uh, uh, I don't know, okay, okay, how about with the, uh, with the
baby's name?
Carol  Marlon-
Ross  Marlon?!
Carol  -if it's a boy, Minnie if it's a girl.
Ross  ...As in Mouse?
Carol  As in my grandmother.
Ross  Still, you- you say Minnie, you hear Mouse. Um, how about, um.. how about
Julia?
Carol  Julia..
Susan  We agreed on Minnie.
Ross  'S'funny, um, uh, we agreed we'd spend the rest of our lives together.
Things change, roll with the punches. I believe Julia's on the table..?
[Scene  Barry's office, Rachel is doing her makeup in the mirror on Barry's lamp as
Barry enters.]
Barry  Sorry about that. So. What have you been up to?
Rachel  Oh, not much. I-I got a job.
Barry  Oh, that's great.
Rachel  Why are- why are you so tanned?
Barry  Oh, I, uh- I went to Aruba.
Rachel  Oh no. You went on our honeymoon alone?
Barry  No. I went with, uh.. Now, this may hurt.
Robbie  Me?!
Barry  No! (To Rachel) I went with Mindy.
Rachel  Mindy?! My maid of honour, Mindy?!
Barry  Yeah, well, uh, we're kind of a thing now.
Rachel  Oh! Well, um.. (Grabs his forehand) You've got plugs!
Barry  Careful! They haven't quite taken yet.
Rachel  And you've got lenses! But you hate sticking your finger in your eye!
Barry  Not for her. Listen, I really wanted to thank you.
Rachel  Okay..
Barry  See, about a month ago, I wanted to hurt you. More than I've ever wanted
to hurt anyone in my life. And I'm an orthodontist.
Rachel  Wow.
Barry  You know, you were right? I mean, I thought we were happy. We weren't
happy. But with Mindy, now I'm happy. Spit.
Rachel  What?
Robbie  Me. (Spits.)
Rachel  Anyway, um, (Gets the ring out of her purse.) I guess this belongs to
you. And thank you for giving it to me.
Barry  Well, thank you for giving it back.
Robbie  Hello?!
[Scene  Carol's OB/GYN, they're still arguing about what to name the baby.]
Susan  Oh, please! What's wrong with Helen?
Ross  Helen Geller? I don't think so.
Carol  Hello? It's not gonna be Helen Geller.
Ross  Thank you!
Carol  No, I mean it's not Geller.
Ross  What, it's gonna be Helen Willick?
Carol  No, actually, um, we talked about Helen Willick-Bunch.
Ross  Well, wait a minute, wha- why is she in the title?
Susan  It's my baby too.
Ross  Oh, 's'funny, really? Um, I don't remember you making any sperm.
Susan  Yeah, and we all know what a challenge that is!
Carol  All right, you two, stop it!
Ross  No no no, she gets a credit, hey, I'm in there too.
Carol  Ross. You're not actually suggesting Helen Willick-Bunch-Geller? 'Cause I
think that borders on child abuse.
Ross  Of course not, I'm... suggesting Geller-Willick-Bunch.
Susan  Oh, no, nonononono, you see what he's doing? He knows no-one's gonna say
all those names, so they'll wind up calling her Geller, then he gets his way!
Ross  My way?! You-you think this is my way? Believe me, of all the ways I ever
imagined this moment in my life being, this is not my way- y'know what? Uh, um, this is
too hard. I'm not, I can't do-
Dr. Oberman  (entering) Knock knock!How are we today? Any nausea?
All  Yeah. Yeah. A little.
Dr. Oberman  Well, I was just wondering about the mother-to-be, but.. thanks for
sharing. (To Carol) Uh, lie back..
Ross  You- uh- y'know what, I'm gonna go. I don't- I don't think I can be
involved in this particular thing right now.
Ross  Oh my God.
Susan  Look at that.
Carol  I know.
[Scene  Monica and Rachel's apartment, everyone is watching the tape of the sonogram.
  Rachel is on the phone.]
Ross  Well? Isn't that amazing?
Joey  What are we supposed to be seeing here?
Chandler  I dunno, but.. I think it's about to attack the Enterprise.
Phoebe  You know, if you tilt your head to the left, and relax your eyes, it
kinda looks like an old potato.
Ross  Then don't do that, alright?
Phoebe  Okay!
Ross  (walks over to where Monica is standing)Monica. Whaddya think?
Monica  (welling up) Mm-hmm.
Ross  Wh- are you welling up?
Monica  No.
Ross  You are, you're welling up.
Monica  Am not!
Ross  You're gonna be an aunt.
Monica  (pushes him and starts to cry) Oh shut up!
Rachel  (on phone) Hi, Mindy. Hi, it-it's Rachel. Yeah, I'm fine. I-I saw Barry
today. Oh, yeah, yeah he-he told me. No, no, it's okay. I hope you two are very happy, I
really do. Oh, oh, and Mind, y'know, if-if everything works out, and you guys end up
getting married and having kids- and everything- I just hope they have his old hairline
and your old nose. (Slams the phone down.) (To everyone) Okay, I know it was a cheap shot,
but I feel so much better now.
Phoebe  (entering) Hi guys!
All  Hey, Pheebs! Hi!
Ross  Hey. Oh, oh, how'd it go?
Phoebe  Um, not so good. He walked me to the subway and said 'We should do this
again!'
All  Ohh. Ouch.
Rachel  What? He said 'we should do it again', that's good, right?
Monica  Uh, no. Loosely translated 'We should do this again' means 'You will
never see me naked'.
Rachel  Since when?
Joey  Since always. It's like dating language. Y'know, like 'It's not you' means
'It is you'.
Chandler  Or 'You're such a nice guy' means 'I'm gonna be dating leather-wearing
alcoholics and complaining about them to you'.
Phoebe  Or, or, y'know, um, 'I think we should see other people' means 'Ha, ha,
I already am'.
Rachel  And everybody knows this?
Joey  Yeah. Cushions the blow.
Chandler  Yeah, it's like when you're a kid, and your parents put your dog to
sleep, and they tell you it went off to live on some farm.
Ross  That's funny, that, no, because, uh, our parents actually did, uh, send
our dog off to live on a farm.
Monica  Uh, Ross.
Ross  What? Wh- hello? The Millners' farm in Connecticut? The Millners, they had
this unbelievable farm, they had horses, and, and rabbits that he could chase and it was-
it w- .....Oh my God, Chi Chi!
[Scene  Chandler and Joey's, Chandler is helping Joey rehearse for a part.]
Chandler  "So how does it feel knowing you're about to die?"
Joey  "Warden, in five minutes my pain will be over. But you'll have to
live with the knowledge that you sent an honest man to die."
Chandler  Hey, that was really good!
Joey  Thanks! Let's keep going.
Chandler  Okay. "So. Whaddya want from me, Damone, huh?"
Joey  "I just wanna go back to my cell. 'Cause in my cell, I can
smoke."
Chandler  "Smoke away."
Chandler  I think this is probably why Damone smokes in his cell alone.
Joey  What?
Chandler  Relax your hand!
Chandler  Not so much!
Joey  Whoah!
Chandler  Hey!
Joey  Hey!
Chandler  Alright, now try taking a puff.
Chandler  Alright.. okay. No. Give it to me.
Joey  No no no, I am not giving you a cigarette.
Chandler  It's fine, it's fine. Look, do you wanna get this part, or not? Here.
Chandler  Don't think of it as a cigarette. Think of it as the thing that's been
missing from your hand. When you're holding it, you feel right. You feel complete.
Joey  Y'miss it?
Chandler  Nah, not so much. Alright, now we smoke. (Takes a puff.) Oh.. my..
God. (He continues to smoke.)
Monica  No, no, no. They say it's the same as the distance from the tip of a
guy's thumb to the tip of his index finger.
Joey  That's ridiculous!
Ross  Can I use.. either thumb?
Rachel  (carrying a tray of drinks) Alright, don't tell me, don't tell me!
(Starts handing them out.) Decaf cappucino for Joey.. Coffee black.. Late.. And an iced
tea. I'm getting pretty good at this!
All  Yeah. Yeah, excellent.
Rachel  (leaving to serve others) Good for me!
Joey  Y'okay, Phoebe?
Phoebe  Yeah- no- I'm just- it's, I haven't worked- It's my bank.
Monica  What did they do to you?
Phoebe  It's nothing, it's just- Okay. I'm going through my mail, and I open up
their monthly, you know, STATEMENT-
Ross  Easy.
Phoebe  - and there's five hundred extra dollars in my account.
Chandler  Oh, Satan's minions at work again...
Phoebe  Yes, 'cause now I have to go down there, and deal with them.
Joey  What are you talking about? Keep it!
Phoebe  It's not mine, I didn't earn it, if I kept it, it would be like
stealing.
Rachel  Yeah, but if you spent it, it would be like shopping!
Phoebe  Okay. Okay, let's say I bought a really great pair of shoes. Do you know
what I'd hear, with every step I took? 'Not-mine. Not-mine. Not-mine.' And even if I was
happy, okay, and, and skipping- 'Not-not-mine, not-not-mine, not-not-mine,
not-not-mine'...
Monica  We're with you. We got it.
Phoebe  Okay. I'd- just- I'd never be able to enjoy it. It would be like this
giant karmic debt.
Rachel  Chandler, what are you doing?
Monica  (puling him up) Hey. Whaddya doing?
All  Oh! Oh, God!
Ross  What is this?!
Chandler  I'm smoking. I'm smoking, I'm smoking.
Phoebe  Oh, I can't believe you! You've been so good, for three years!
Chandler  And this- is my reward!
Ross  Hold on a second, alright? Just think about what you went through the last
time you quit.
Chandler  Okay, so this time I won't quit!
All  Ohhh! Put it out!
Chandler  All right! I'm putting it out, I'm putting it out. (He drops it in
Phoebe's coffee.)
Phoebe  Oh, no! I- I can't drink this now!
Monica  Alright. I'm gonna go change, I've got a date.
Rachel  This Alan again? How's it goin'?
Monica  'S'going pretty good, y'know? It's nice, and, we're having fun.
Joey  So when do we get to meet the guy?
Monica  Let's see, today's Monday... Never.
All  Oh, come on! Come on!
Monica  No. Not after what happened with Steve.
Chandler  What are you talking about? We love Schhteve! Schhteve was schhexy!..
Sorry.
Monica  Look, I don't even know how I feel about him yet. Just give me a chance
to figure that out.
Rachel  Well, then can we meet him?
Monica  Nope. Schhorry.
[Scene  Iridium, Monica and Paula are at work.]
Monica  I mean, why should I let them meet him? I mean, I bring a guy home, and
within five minutes they're all over him. I mean, they're like- coyotes, picking off the
weak members of the herd.
Monica  I know. I just wish that once, I'd bring a guy home that they actually
liked.
Paula  Well, you do realise the odds of that happening are a little slimmer if
they never get to meet the guy..
[Scene  Monica and Rachel's, Chandler is smoking out on the balcony, Phoebe is absent.]
Joey  Let it go, Ross.
Ross  Yeah, well, you didn't know Chi Chi.
Monica  Do you all promise?
All  Yeah! We promise! We'll be good!
Monica  (shouts to Chandler) Chandler? Do you promise to be good?
Joey  You can come in, but your filter-tipped little buddy has to stay outside!
Ross  Hey, Pheebs.
Phoebe  'Dear Ms. Buffay. Thank you for calling attention to our error. We have
credited your account with five hundred dollars. We're sorry for the inconvenience, and
hope you'll accept this- (Searches in her purse) -football phone as our free gift.'
Do you believe this?! Now I have a thousand dollars, and a football phone!
Rachel  What bank is this?
Monica  Hey. It's him. (On the intercom) Who is it?
Alan  (on the intercom) It's Alan.
Joey  (shouting to Chandler) Chandler! He's here!
Monica  (to all) Okay, please be good, please. Just remember how much you
all like me.
Monica  Hi. Alan, this is everybody. Everybody, this is Alan.
Alan  Hi.
All  Hi, Alan.
Alan  I've heard schho much about all you guyschh!
Monica  (to Alan) Thanks. I'll call you tomorrow. (Alan exits, to all) Okay.
Okay, let's let the Alan-bashing begin. Who's gonna take the first shot, hmm?
Monica  C'mon!
Ross  ...I'll go. Let's start with the way he kept picking at- no, I'm sorry, I
can't do this, can't do this. We loved him.
All  Loved him! Yeah! He's great!
Monica  Wait a minute! We're talking about someone that I'm going out
with?
All  Yeah!
Rachel  And did you notice...? (She spreads her thumb and index finger.)
The Guys  (reluctantly) Yeah.
Joey  Know what was great? The way his smile was kinda crooked.
Phoebe  Yes, yes! Like the man in the shoe!
Ross  ...What shoe?
Phoebe  From the nursery rhyme. 'There was a crooked man, Who had a crooked
smile, Who lived in a shoe, For a... while...'
Ross  ...So I think Alan will become the yardstick against which all future
boyfriends will be measured.
Rachel  What future boyfriends? Nono, I th- I think this could be, y'know, it.
Monica  Really!
Chandler  Oh, yeah. I'd marry him just for his David Hasselhof impression alone.
You know I'm gonna be doing that at parties, right? (Does the impression)
Ross  You know what I like most about him, though?
All  What?
Ross  The way he makes me feel about myself.
All  Yeah...
[Scene  Central Perk, Monica is alone as Ross, Rachel, Chandler, and Joey enter
dejectedly in softball gear.]
Monica  Hi.. how was the game?
Ross  Well..
All  WE WON!! Thank you! Yes!
Joey  Alan.
Ross  He was unbelievable. He was like that-that-that Bugs Bunny cartoon where
Bugs is playing all the positions, right, but instead of Bugs it was first base-Alan,
second base-Alan, third base-...
Rachel  I mean, it-it was like, it was like he made us into a team.
Chandler  Yep, we sure showed those Hassidic jewellers a thing or two about
softball..
Monica  Can I ask you guys a question? D'you ever think that Alan is maybe..
sometimes..
Ross  What?
Monica  ..I dunno, a little too Alan?
Rachel  Well, no. That's impossible. You can never be too Alan.
Ross  Yeah, it's his, uh, innate Alan-ness that-that-that we adore.
Chandler  I personally could have a gallon of Alan.
[Scene  A street, Phoebe walks up to a homeless person (Lizzie) she knows.]
Phoebe  Hey, Lizzie.
Lizzie  Hey, Weird Girl.
Phoebe  I brought you alphabet soup.
Lizzie  Did you pick out the vowels?
Phoebe  Yes. But I left in the Ys. 'Cause, y'know, "sometimes y". Uh,
I also have something else for you. (She searches in her purse.)
Lizzie  Saltines?
Phoebe  No, but would you like a thousand dollars and a football phone?
Lizzie  What? (She opens the envelope Phoebe has given her.) Oh my God, there's
really money in here.
Phoebe  I know.
Lizzie  Weird Girl, what are you doing?
Phoebe  No, I want you to have it. I don't want it.
Lizzie  No, no, I ha-I have to give you something.
Phoebe  Oh, that's fine, no.
Lizzie  Would you like my tin-foil hat?
Phoebe  No. 'Cause you need that. No, it's okay, thanks.
Lizzie  Please, let me do something.
Phoebe  Okay, alright, you buy me a soda, and then we're even. Okay?
Lizzie  Okay.
Phoebe  Okay.
[Scene  Chandler's office, Chandler looks around, opens his desk drawer, takes a puff
of a cigarette, sprays around some air freshener, and takes some breath spray.  He
types for a little while, opens the drawer again, and takes another drag of the cigarette.
  While not paying attention, he sprays the breath spray around the room, takes a
squirt of air freshener and gags.]
[Scene  A Street, Phoebe and Lizzie are at a hot dog vendor.]
Lizzie  Keep the change. (To Phoebe) Sure you don't wanna pretzel?
Phoebe  No, I'm fine.
Lizzie  (leaves) See ya.
Phoebe  Huh!
[Scene  Central Perk, Phoebe is telling everyone about her discovery.]
Ross  A thumb?!
All  Eww!
Phoebe  I know! I know, I opened it up and there it was, just floating in there,
like this tiny little hitch-hiker!
Chandler  Well, maybe it's a contest, y'know? Like, collect all five?
Phoebe  Does, um, anyone wanna see?
All  Nooo!
All  Oh, hey, don't do that! Cut it out!
Rachel  It's worse than the thumb!
Chandler  Hey, this is so unfair!
Monica  Oh, why is it unfair?
Chandler  So I have a flaw! Big deal! Like Joey's constant knuckle-cracking
isn't annoying? And Ross, with his over-pronouncing every single word? And Monica, with
that snort when she laughs? I mean, what the hell is that thing? ...I accept all those
flaws, why can't you accept me for this?
Joey  ...Does the knuckle-cracking bother everybody?
Rachel  Well, I-I could live without it.
Joey  Well, is it, like, a little annoying, or is it like when Phoebe chews her
hair?
Ross  Oh, now, don't listen to him, Pheebs, I think it's endearing.
Joey  Oh, (Imitating Ross) "you do, do you"?
Ross  You know, there's nothing wrong with speaking correctly.
Rachel  "Indeed there isn't"... I should really get back to work.
Phoebe  Yeah, 'cause otherwise someone might get what they actually ordered.
Rachel  Ohh-ho-hooohhh. The hair comes out, and the gloves come on.
[Scene  Iridium, Monica and Paula are working.]
Monica  Did you ever go out with a guy your friends all really like?
Paula  No.
Monica  Okay.. Well, I'm going out with a guy my friends all really like.
Paula  Waitwait.. we talking about the coyotes here? All right, a cow got
through!
Monica  Can you believe it? ...Y'know what? I just don't feel the thing.
I mean, they feel the thing, I don't feel the thing.
Paula  Honey.. you should always feel the thing. Listen, if that's how
you feel about the guy, Monica, dump him!
Monica  I know.. it's gonna be really hard.
Paula  Well, he's a big boy, he'll get over it.
Monica  No, he'll be fine. It's the other five I'm worried about.
[Scene  Cental Perk, Joey and Ross are persecuting Chandler about his smoking.]
Joey  Do you have any respect for your body?
Ross  Don't you realise what you're-you're doing to yourself?
Chandler  Hey, y'know, I have had it with you guys and your cancer and your
emphysema and your heart disease. The bottom line is, smoking is cool, and you know it.
Rachel  (holding the phone out to Chandler) Chandler? It's Alan, he wants to
speak to you.
Chandler  Really? He does? (taking the phone) Hey, buddy, what's up! Oh, she
told you about that, huh. Well, yeah, I have one now and then. Well, yeah, now. Well, it's
not that big- ..well, that's true,.. Gee, y'know, no-one- no-one's ever put it like that
before. Well, okay, thanks! (He hands the phone back and stubs out his cigarette.)
Rachel  (to Ross, who has wandered up) God, he's good.
Ross  If only he were a woman.
Rachel  Yeah.
[Scene  Monica and Rachel's, everyond except Monica and Joey is watching Lambchop.]
Chandler  Ooh, Lambchop. How old is that sock? If I had a sock on my hand for
thirty years it'd be talking too.
Ross  Okay. I think it's time to change somebody's nicotine patch. (Does so.)
Monica  (entering) Hey. Where's Joey?
Chandler  Joey ate my last stick of gum, so I killed him. Do you think that was
wrong?
Rachel  I think he's across the hall.
Monica  Thanks. (Goes to fetch him.)
Ross  (finishing changing Chandler's nicotine patch) There y'go.
Chandler  (deadpan) Ooh, I'm alive with pleasure now.
Ross  Hey Pheebs, you gonna have the rest of that Pop-Tart?.. Pheebs?
Phoebe  Does anyone want the rest of this Pop-Tart?
Ross  Hey, I might!
Phoebe  Sorry. ..Y'know, those stupid soda people gave me seven thousand dollars
for the thumb.
All  You're kidding. Oh my God.
Phoebe  And on my way over here, I stepped in gum. ...What is up with the
universe?!
Joey  (dragged in by Monica, he has just gotten out of the shower) What's going
on?
Monica  Nothing. I just think it's nice when we're all here together.
Joey  Even nicer when everyone gets to wear their underwear..
Rachel  Uh, Joey..
Joey  Oh, God! (Hurriedly closes his legs.)
Monica  (turns off the TV) Okay..
All  Oh! That was Lambchop!
Monica  Please, guys, we have to talk.
Phoebe  Wait, wait, I'm getting a deja vu...no, I'm not.
Monica  Alright, we have to talk.
Phoebe  There it is!
Monica  Okay. It's-it's about Alan. There's something that you should know. I
mean, there's really no easy way to say this.. uh.. I've decided to break up with Alan.
Ross  Is there somebody else?
Monica  No, nononono.. it's just.. things change. People change.
Rachel  We didn't change..
Joey  So that's it? It's over? Just like that?
Phoebe  You know.. you let your guard down, you start to really care about
someone, and I just- I- (starts chewing her hair)
Monica  Look, I- I could go on pretending-
Joey  Okay!
Monica  -but that wouldn't be fair to me, it wouldn't be fair to Alan- It
wouldn't be fair to you!
Ross  Who-who wants fair? Y'know, I just want things back. Y'know, the way they
were.
Monica  I'm sorry..
Chandler  (sarcastic) Oh, she's sorry! I feel better!
Rachel  (tearful) I just can't believe this! I mean, with the holidays coming
up- I wanted him to meet my family-
Monica  I'll meet somone else. There'll be other Alans.
All  Oh, yeah! Right!
Monica  Are you guys gonna be okay?
Ross  Hey hey, we'll be fine. We're just gonna need a little time.
Monica  (dubious) I understand.
[Scene  A Restaurant, Monica is breaking the news to Alan.]
Alan  Wow.
Monica  I'm, I'm really sorry.
Alan  Yeah, I'm sorry too. But, I gotta tell you, I am a little relieved.
Monica  Relieved?
Alan  Yeah, well, I had a great time with you.. I just can't stand your friends.
Rachel  Remember when we went to Central Park and rented boats?.. That was fun.
Ross  Yeah. He could row like a viking.
Monica  (entering) Hi.
All  Mmm.
Ross  So how'd it go?
Monica  Oh, y'know..
Phoebe  Did he mention us?
Monica  He said he's really gonna miss you guys. (dubious look)
Ross  You had a rough day, huh.. c'mere. (She sits down and Ross strokes her
forehead.)
Chandler  ...That's it. I'm getting cigarettes.
All  No no no!
Chandler  (leaving) I don't care, I don't care! Game's over! I'm weak! I've
gotta smoke! I've gotta have the smoke!
Phoebe  (shouting as he leaves) If you never smoke again I'll give you seven
thousand dollars!
Chandler  (returns) Yeah, alright.
Monica  Alright. Phoebe?
Phoebe  Okay, okay. If I were omnipotent for a day,
I would want, um, world peace, no more hunger, good things for the rain-forest...And
bigger boobs!
Ross  Yeah, see.. you took mine. Chandler, what
about you?
Chandler  Uh, if I were omnipotent for a day, I'd..
make myself omnipotent forever.
Rachel  See, there's always one guy. (Mocking)
"If I had a wish, I'd wish for three more wishes." (Joey enters.)
All  Hey Joey. Hi. Hey, buddy.
Monica  Hey, Joey, what would you do if you were
omnipotent?
Joey  Probably kill myself!
Monica  ..Excuse me?
Joey  Hey, if Little Joey's dead, then I got no
reason to live!
Ross  Joey, uh- OMnipotent.
Joey  You are? Ross, I'm sorry..
[Scene  Central Perk, Ross and Monica are watching Phoebe
sleep.]
Monica  How does she do that?
Ross  I cannot sleep in a public place.
Monica  Would you look at her? She is so peaceful.
Phoebe  (waking and startling them) Oh! What what
what! ...Hi.
Ross  It's okay, y'know, you just nodded off again.
Monica  What's going on with you?
Phoebe  I got no sleep last night!
Ross  Why?
Phoebe  My grandmother has this new boyfriend, and
they're both kind of insecure in bed. Oh, and deaf. So they're constantly, like, having to
reassure each other that they're having a good time. You have no idea how loud they are!
Monica  Well, if you want, you can stay with Rachel
and me tonight.
Phoebe  Thanks.
Joey  ...Ninety-five, ninety-six, ninety-seven. See,
I told you! Less than a hundred steps from our place to here.
Chandler  You got waaaay too much free time.
Chandler  Happy birthday, pal!
Joey  We love you, man. (Kisses Ross)
Ross  Funny, my birthday was seven months ago.
Joey  So?
Ross  So, I'm guessing you had an extra ticket and
couldn't decide which one of you got to bring a date?
Chandler  Well, aren't we Mr. "The glass is
half empty."
Ross  Oh my God, oh- is today the twentieth, October
twentieth?
Monica  Oh, I was hoping you wouldn't remember.
Ross  Ohhh.
Joey  What's wrong with the twentieth?
Chandler  Eleven days before Halloween.. all the
good costumes are gone?
Ross  Today's the day Carol and I first..
consummated our physical relationship. (Joey is puzzled.) Sex. ..You know what, I-I'd
better pass on the game. I think I'm just gonna go home and think about my ex-wife and her
lesbian lover.
Joey  The hell with hockey, let's all do that!
Chandler  (trying to stop Ross leaving) C'mon, Ross!
You, me, Joey, ice, guys' night out, c'mon, whaddya say, big guy, (Pretending to punch him
in the stomach.) Huh? Huh? Huh?
Ross  What are you doing?
Chandler  (stops) I have no idea.
Joey  C'mon, Ross!
Ross  Alright, alright, maybe it'll take my mind off
it. Do you promise to buy me a big thumb finger?
Chandler  You got it.
Rachel  Look-look-look-look-look, my first pay
check! Look at the window, there's my name! Hi, me!
Phoebe  I remember the day I got my first pay check.
There was a cave in in one of the mines, and eight people were killed.
Monica  Wow, you worked in a mine?
Phoebe  I worked in a Dairy Queen, why?
Rachel  God, isn't this exciting? I earned this. I
wiped tables for it, I steamed milk for it, and it was totally(opens
envelope)not worth it. Who's FICA? Why's he getting all my money? I mean, what-
Chandler, look at that.
Chandler  (looking) Oh, this is not that bad.
Joey  Oh, you're fine, yeah, for a first job.
Ross  You can totally, totally live on this.
Monica  Yeah, yeah.
Ross  Oh, by the way, great service
tonight.
All  Oh! Yeah!
Guys  Hockey! (They go to leave but are
blocked by three of Rachel's friends, Leslie, Kiki, and Joanne.  The guys pause to
stare at them.) Hockey! Hockey. (The guys.)
Leslie  (looking around) Rachel?
Rachel  Oh my God! (Rachel, Leslie, Kiki, and Joanne
all scream and hug each other.
Monica  (to Phoebe) I swear I've seen birds do this
on Wild Kingdom.
Rachel  What are you guys doing here?
Kiki  Well, we were in the city shopping,
and your mom said you work here, aaand it's true!
Joanne  Look at you in the apron.
You look like you're in a play.
Rachel  (to a pregnant Leslie) Look at you, you are
so big I can't believe it!
Leslie  I know. I know! I'm a duplex.
Rachel  (to Joanne) So what's going on with you?
Joanne  Well, guess who my dad's
making partner in his firm? (She points to herself and they all scream again.)
Kiki  And while we're on the subject of
news.. (She holds up here finger to show off her engagement ring and they all scream
again.)
Phoebe  (to Monica) Look, look, I have elbows! (They
scream.)
[Scene  A Street, Chandler and Joey are kicking a can to
each other.]
Chandler  ...Poulet passes it up to Leetch! (Passes
it to Joey.)
Joey  Leetch spots Messier in the crease- there's
the pass! (He kicks it to Ross, but Ross is staring into a shop window.)
Chandler  We'll take a brief time out while Messier
stops to look at some women's shoes.
Ross  Carol was wearing boots just like those the
night that we- we first- y'know. Fact, she, uh- she never took'em off, 'cause we-we- (off
Chandler's look) Sorry. Sorry.
Joey  What?
Ross  Peach pit.
Chandler  Yes, Bunny?
Ross  (points) Peach pit. That night we, uh- we had-
Joey  -Peaches?
Ross  Actually, nectarines, but basically...
Chandler  (to Joey) Could've been a peach.
Ross  Then, uh, then we got dressed, and I-I... I
walked her to the- (looks up, realises, and points) -the bus stop... I'm fine.
Joey  Hey, that woman's got an ass like Carol's!
(They turn to stare at him.) What? Thought we were trying to find stuff.
[Scene  Central Perk, Rachel, Lesile, Kiki, and Joanne are
talking.]
Rachel  So c'mon, you guys, tell me all the dirt!
Kiki  Well, the biggest news is still you dumping
Barry at the altar!
Joanne  Alright. Let's talk reality for a second.
Rachel  Okay.
Joanne  When are you coming home?
Rachel  What? Guys, I'm not.
Joanne  C'mon, this is us.
Rachel  I'm not! This is what I'm doing now. I've
got this job-
Kiki  Waitressing?
Rachel  Okay, I'm not just waitressing. I'm.. I,
um... I write the specials on the specials board, and, uh... and I, uh... I take the uh
dead flowers out of the vase... Oh, and, um, sometimes Artelle lets me put the little
chocolate blobbies on the cookies.
Leslie  Well. Your mom didn't tell us
about the blobbies.
[Scene  Monica and Rachel's, Phoebe and Monica are in
pajamas and Monica is making something in the blender as Rachel enters.]
Monica  Hey, Rach. How was it with your friends?
(She and Phoebe scream.) Okay! How would you like some Tiki Death Punch? (She pours the
contents of the blender into some glasses.)
Rachel  What's that?
Monica  Weeeell, it's rum, and-
Rachel  Okay. (Grabs the blender and starts to
drink.)
Monica  We thought since Phoebe was staying over
tonight we'd have kinda like a slumber party thing. We got some trashy magazines, we got
cookie dough, we got Twister... (The phone rings and Monica answers it.)
Phoebe  Ooh! Ooh! And I brought Operation!
But, um, I lost the tweezers, so we can't operate. But we can prep the guy!
Monica  Uh, Rach, it's the Visa card
people.
Rachel  Oh, God, ask them what they want.
Monica  (on phone) Could you please tell me what
this is in reference to? (Listens) Yes, hold on. (To Rachel) Um, they say there's been
some unusual activity on your account.
Rachel  But I haven't used my card in weeks!
Monica  That is the unusual
activity. Look, they just wanna see if you're okay.
Rachel  They wanna know if I'm okay. Okay.. they
wanna know if I'm okay, okay, let's see. Well, let's see, the FICA guys took all my money,
everyone I know is either getting married, or getting promoted, or getting pregnant, and
I'm getting coffee! And it's not even for me! So if that sounds like I'm okay, okay, then
you can tell them I'm okay, okay?
Monica  (pauses then on the phone) Uh- Rachel has
left the building, can you call back?
Rachel  Alright, c'mon! (Miserably) Let's play Twister!
[Scene  Madison Square Garden, the guys are trying
to find their seats.]
Ross  (squeezing past people) Sorry, sorry... Uh-oh.
Chandler  What? There was ice there that night with
Carol? Plastic seats? Four thousand angry Pittsburgh fans?
Ross  No, actually I was just saying it looks like
we're not sitting together. But now you mention it, there was ice there that
night... It was the first frost...
Joey  C'mon, sit. Just sit down, sit.
[Scene  Monica and Rachel's, they're all hanging out in the
living room.]
Monica  You should feel great about yourself! You're
doing this amazing independence thing!
Rachel  Monica, what is so amazing? I gave up, like,
everything. And for what?
Phoebe  You are just like Jack.
Rachel  ...Jack from downstairs?
Phoebe  No, Jack and the Beanstalk.
Monica  Ah, the other Jack.
Phoebe  Yeah, right! See, he gave up something, but
then he got those magic beans. And then he woke up, and there was this, this big plant
outside his window, full of possibilities and stuff.. And he lived in a village, and you
live in the Village..
Rachel  Okay, but Pheebs, Pheebs, Jack gave up a
cow, I gave up an orthodontist. Okay, I-I-I know, I know I didn't love him-
Phoebe  Oh, see, Jack did love the cow.
Rachel  But see, it was a plan. Y'know, it was
clear. It was figured out, and now everything's just kinda like...
Phoebe  Floopy?
Rachel  Yeah.
Monica  So what, you're not the only one. I mean,
half the time we don't know where we're going. You've just gotta figure at some point it's
all gonna come together, and it's just gonna be... un-floopy.
Phoebe  Oh, like that's a word.
Rachel  Okay, but Monica, what if- what if it
doesn't come together?
Monica  ...Pheebs?
Phoebe  Oh, well... 'cause.... you just... I don't
like this question.
Rachel  Okay, see, see, you guys, what if we don't
get magic beans? I mean, what if all we've got are.. beans?
[Scene  Madison Square Garden, the guys are
watching the game.]
Ross  Get him! GET HIM! Get him! Get- YESSS! Not
laughing now, are ya pal!
Chandler  (to Ross) See buddy, that's all you need,
a bunch of toothless guys hitting each other with sticks.
Ross  Pass it! Pass it!
Chandler  He's open!
All  Shoot! Shoot! Shoot!
Chandler  Hey, look, we're on that TV thing!
[Scene  An Emergency Room, Chandler and Joey are leading
Ross in.]
Chandler  (to the receptionist)'Scuse me.
Receptionist  (holds up her handshe is on the
phone) It says to call this number if you're not completely satisfied with this candy bar.
Well, I'm not completely satisfied.
Chandler  Listen, it's kind of an emergency. Well, I
guess you know that, or we'd be in the predicament room. (The receptionist glares at him.)
Receptionist  (on phone) Hold on. (To Chandler) Fill
these out, sit over there. (Tosses him some forms.)
Ross  (jumping to his feet) Look, I don't wanna make
any trouble, okay, but I'm in a lot of pain here, alright? My face is dented.
Receptionist  Well, you'll have to wait your turn.
Joey  Well, how long do you think it'll be?
Receptionist  (sarcastic) Any minute now.
Ross  Hey, this- (she gives him a look and the guys
back off) Heyy...
[Scene  Monica and Rachel's, the slumber party continues.]
Rachel  I'm so sorry, you guys. I didn't mean to
bring you down.
Monica  No, you were right. I don't have a plan.
(There's a knock on the door.)
Pizza Guy  (yelling from outside) Pizza
guy!
Rachel  Thank God. Food. (She goes to answer the
door.)
Monica  Phoebe?
Phoebe  What?
Monica  Do you have a plan?
Phoebe  I don't even have a 'pl'.
Pizza Guy  Hi, one, uh, mushroom, green
pepper and onion?
Rachel  (miserably) No, no, that's not what we
ordered... We ordered a fat-free crust with extra cheese.
Pizza Guy  Wait, you're not
'G.Stephanopoulos?' Man, my dad's gonna kill me!
Monica  (leaping off of the couch and runs up) Wait!
Did you say 'G.Stephanopoulos?'
Pizza Guy  Yeah. This one goes across the
street, I must have given him yours. Oh, bonehead, bonehead!
Monica  Wait, was this a-a small mediterranean guy
with curiously intelligent good looks?
Pizza Guy  Yeah, that sounds about right.
Monica  Was he wearing a stunning blue suit?
Phoebe  And-and a power tie?
Pizza Guy  No, pretty much just a towel.
Monica  (staggered) Oh God.
Pizza Guy  So you guys want me to take
this back?
Monica  Are you nuts?! We've got George
Stephanopoulos' pizza! (Rachel pays him, Monica grabs some binoculars, and runs to the
window.)
Rachel  Uh, Pheebs? Who's George Snuffalopagus?
Phoebe  Big Bird's friend.
Monica  I see pizza!
Phoebe  Oh, I wanna see! Lemme see! Lemme see! (She
runs up and takes the binoculars.)
Rachel  Hello? Who are we spying on?
Monica  White House adviser? Clinton's campaign guy?
The one with the great hair, sexy smile, really cute butt?
Rachel  Oh, him, the little guy? Oh, I love him!
Phoebe  Ooh, wait.. wait, I see a woman.
Monica  Please tell me it's his mother.
Phoebe  Definitely not his mother.
Monica  Oh, no...
Phoebe  Oh, wait, she's walking across the floor..
she's walking.. she's walking.. she's going for the pizza- (Yelling) Hey, that's not for
you, bitch! (Phoebe covers her mouth with her hand walks away from the window.)
[Scene  The Emergency Room, Joey is miming hockey pucks
kitting foreheads.  Chandler realises it's getting tense and goes to the receptionist
again.]
Chandler  Excuse me, look, we've been here for over
an hour, and a lot of people less sick than my friend have gone in. I mean, that guy with
the toe thing? Who's he sleeping with? (She slides the gladd panel over and Chandler talks
through it in a loud voice.) Oh, c'mon Dora, don't be mad... I know we both said some
things we didn't mean, but that doesn't mean we still don't love each other. (To the
waiting room.) Y'know, I feel like I've lost her.. (She slides the panel back, he turns,
and it takes him by surprise.) Ba-!
[Scene  Monica and Rachel's, the girls are all out on the
balcony.]
Monica  Light still out?
Rachel  Yeah.
Monica  Oh. Maybe they're- napping.
Rachel  Oh please, they're having sex.
Monica and Phoebe  Shut up!
Rachel  So, whaddya think George is like?
Monica  I think he's shy.
Phoebe  Yeah?
Monica  Yeah. I think you have to draw him out. And
then- when you do- he's a preppy animal.
[Scene  The Emergency Room, Ross is still going on about
his first night with Carol.]
Ross  I remember the moonlight coming through the
window- and her face had the most incredible glow.
Chandler  Yes, the moon, the glow, the magical
feeling, you did this part- Could I get some painkillers over here, please?
Joey  He's right, enough, already. What is the big
deal about today? So you slept with her for the first time, so what? You slept with her
for seven years after that.
Ross  Look, it's just a little more complicated...
Chandler  Well, what? What? What is it? That she
left you? That she likes women? That she left you for another woman that likes women?
Ross  Little louder, okay, I think there's a man on
the twelfth floor in a coma that didn't quite hear you...
Chandler  Then what?
Ross  My first time with Carol was... (He mumbles
the last part)
Joey  What?
Ross  It was my first time.
Joey  With Carol? (Ross gives him a look.) Oh.
Chandler  So in your whole life, you've only been
with one(He gets a look too)oh.
Joey  Whoah, boy, hockey was a big mistake! There
was a whole bunch of stuff we could've done tonight!
[Scene  Monica and Rachel's, the girls are still out on the
balcony.]
Monica  Okay. Okay, I got one. Do you remember that
vegetarian pate that I made that you loved so much?
Phoebe  Uh-huh.
Monica  Well, unless goose is a vegetable...ha
haaaah!
Phoebe  Oh! Oh! Oh! Okay, fine, fine. Now I don't
feel so bad about sleeping with Jason Hurley.
Monica  What?! You slept with Jason?
Phoebe  You'd already broken up.
Rachel  How long?
Phoebe  A couple hours.
Monica  Oh, that's nice!
Rachel  Okay, okay, okay, I got one! (She sits up
and the cushion she was leaning against falls off of the balcony.) Anyway- The valentine
Tommy Rollerson left in your locker was really from me.
Monica  Excuse me?!
Rachel  Hello? Like he was really gonna send you
one? (To Phoebe) She was a big girl.
Monica  Really. Well, at least 'big girls' don't pee
in their pants in seventh grade!
Rachel  I was laughing! You made me laugh! (Monica
and Rachel start to squabble)
Phoebe  There he is! There he is!
Monica  Where?
Phoebe  Right- where we've been looking all night!
Rachel  He is so cute!
Monica  Oh, George, baby, drop the towel!
All  Yeah, drop it! Drop the towel! Please drop
the(pause)wowww.
[Scene  The Emergency Room, Ross is absent.]
Joey  Man. Can you believe he's only had sex with
one woman?
Chandler  I think it's great. Y'know, it's sweet,
it's romantic...
Joey  Really?
Chandler  No, you kidding? The guy's a freak.. (Ross
enters off camera)
Both  Hey, buddy.
Ross  Hi. (He is wearing a piece of steel bandaged
to his nose.  He tosses some forms onto reception desk.)
Receptionist  (sarcastic) Oh, that's attractive.
Chandler  Oh, I thought you were great in Silence of
the Lambs. Oh come on, admit it! All things considered, you had fun tonight.
Ross  Fun? Where was the fun? Tell me specifically,
which part was the fun part? Where's my puck?
Joey  Oh, ah- the kid has it.
Ross  The kid...? (To the kid) Excuse me, uh,
that's, that's my puck.
Kid  I found it. Finders keepers, losers
weepers. (Ross looks at Chandler for help.)
Chandler  You gotta do it, man.
Ross  (to the kid) Oh yeah? Well, I'm rubber, you're
glue, whatever(to Chandler)can't do it. (to the kid) Listen, uh- gimme back my
puck.
Kid  No.
Ross  'Yes', how about. C'mere. Gimme!
Kid  No! No! (They start to fight over
it.)
Receptionist  Hey! Hey! No rough holding in my ER!
Ross  (tries to snatch it from the kid) GIVE ME MY
PUCK!! (but it files out of his grasp and knocks out the receptionist)
Ross  ...Now that was fun.
[Scene  Monica and Rachel's, Joey and the girls are playing
twister.]
Monica  Could've played Monopoly, but
nooooo.
Chandler  Thanks. (The guy nods and leaves)
Chandler  Hello? Oh, uh, Rachel, it's the Visa card
people.
Rachel  Oh, okay. Will you take my place?
Chandler  Alright. (on phone) Yes, this is Rachel.
Rachel  Nooo! (She grabs the phone and Chandler
takes her place on the mat.) (On phone) Hello? (Listens) Oh, yeah, no, I know, I-I haven't
been using it much. (Listens) Oh, well, thanks, but, I'm okay, really.
Ross  Green. To the green.
Rachel  (on phone) I've got magic beans. (Listens)
Never-never mind.
Chandler  To the left, to the left- aww! (They all
collapse)
Rachel  (on phone) Ohhh... I'm fine.
[Scene  Central Perk, all six are there.]
Monica  Would you let it go? It's not that big a deal.
Ross  Not that big a deal? It's amazing. Ok, you just reach in there, there's
one little maneuver, and bam, a bra right out the sleeve. All right, as far as I'm
concerned, there is nothing a guy can do that even comes close. Am I right?
Rachel  Come on! You guys can pee standing up.
Chandler  We can? All right, I'm tryin' that.
Joey  Ok, you know what blows my mind? Women can see breasts any time they want.
You just look down and there they are. How you get any work done is beyond me.
Phoebe  Oh, ok, you know what I don't get? The way guys can do so many mean
things, and then not even care.
Ross  Multiple orgasms!
[Scene  Central Perk, all are there.]
Chandler  So, Saturday night, the big night, date night, Saturday night,
Sat-ur-day night!
Joey  No plans, huh?
Chandler  Not a one.
Ross  Not even, say, breaking up with Janice?
Chandler  Oh, right, right, shut up.
Monica  Chandler, nobody likes breaking up with someone. You just gotta do it.
Chandler  No, I know, but it's just so hard, you know? I mean, you're sitting
there with her, she has no idea what's happening, and then you finally get up the courage
to do it, and there's the horrible awkward moment when you've handed her the note.
Joey  Why do you have to break up with her? Be a man, just stop calling.
Phoebe  You know, if you want, I'll do it with you.
Chandler  Oh, thanks, but I think she'd feel like we're gangin' up on her.
Phoebe  No, I mean you break up with Janice and I'll break up with Tony.
Ross  Tony?
Monica  Oh, you're breaking up with Tony?
Phoebe  Yeah, I know, he's sweet, but it's just not fun anymore, you know? I
don't know if it's me, or his hunger strike, or, I don't know.
Rachel  (waitressing) Does anybody want anything else?
Ross  Oh, yeah, last week you had a wonderful, nutty, chocolatey kind of a cakey
pie thing. (Rachel gives him a dirty look) Nothing, just, just, I'm fine.
Phoebe  (to Rachel) What's the matter? Why so scrunchy?
Rachel  It's my father. He wants to give me a Mercedes convertible.
Ross  That guy, he burns me up.
Rachel  Yeah, well, it's a Mercedes if I move back home. Oh, it was horrible. He
called me young lady.
Chandler  Ooh, I hate when my father calls me that.
Monica  Did he give you that whole "You're-not-up-to-this" thing
again?
Rachel  Oh, yeah, yeah. Actually, I got the extended disco version, with three
choruses of "You'll never make it on your own".
Phoebe  (rhythmically) Uh-huh, uh-huh.
Angela  Hi, Joey.
Joey  My god, Angela.
Monica  Wow, being dumped by you obviously agrees with her.
Phoebe  Are you gonna go over there?
Joey  No, yeah, no, ok, but not yet. I don't wanna seem too eager. One
Mississippi, two Mississippi, three Mississippi. That seems pretty cool. (he walks over to
her) Hey, Angela.
Angela  (casually) Joey.
Joey  You look good.
Angela  That's because I'm wearing a dress that accents my boobs.
Joey  You don't say.
Ross  So, uh, Rachel, what are you, uh, what're you doing tonight?
Rachel  Oh, big glamour night. Me and Monica at Laundorama.
Ross  Oh, you uh, you wanna hear a freaky coincidence? Guess who's doing laundry
there too?
Rachel  Who?
Ross  Me. Was that not clear? Hey, why don't, um, why don't I just join you
both, here?
Rachel  Don't you have a laundry room in your building?
Ross  Yes, I do have a laundry room in my building, um, but there's a.... rat
problem. Apparently they're attracted to the dryer sheets, and they're goin' in fine, but
they're comin' out all.... fluffy. Anyway, say, sevenish?
Rachel  Sure.
Angela  Forget it Joey. I'm with Bob now.
Joey  Bob? Who the hell's Bob?
Angela  Bob is great. He's smart, he's sophisticated, and he has a real job.
You, you go on three auditions a month and you call yourself an actor, but Bob...
Joey  Come on, we were great together. And not just at the fun stuff, but like,
talking too.
Angela  Yeah, well, sorry, Joe. You said let's just be friends, so guess what?
Joey  What?
Angela  We're just friends.
Joey  Fine, fine, so, why don't the four of us go out and have dinner together
tonight? You know, as friends?
Angela  What four of us?
Joey  You know, you and Bob, and me and my girlfriend, uh, uh, Monica.
[Scene  Monica and Rachel's apartment, Joey is there, trying to convince Monica to pose
as his girlfriend. His plan is to hook Monica up with Angela's boyfriend Bob and then take
Angela back for himself.]
Joey  Monica, I'm tellin' you, this guy is perfect for you.
Monica  Forget it. Not after your cousin who could belch the alphabet.
Joey  Come on. This guy's great. His name's Bob. He's Angela's... brother. He's
smart, he's sophisticated, and he has a real job. Me, I go on three auditions a month and
call myself an actor, but Bob is...
Monica  (looking out window) Oh, god help us.
Joey  What?
Monica  Ugly Naked Guy's laying kitchen tile. Eww!
Joey  Eww! Look, I'm asking a favor here. If I do this for her brother, maybe
Angela will come back to me.
Monica  What's going on here? You go out with tons of girls.
Joey  (proud) I know, but, I made a huge mistake. I never should have broken up
with her. Will you help me? Please?
[Scene  Ross' apartment, Chandler is over.]
Ross  (on phone) Ok, bye. (hangs up) Well, Monica's not coming, it's just gonna
be me and Rachel.
Chandler  Oh. Well, hold on camper, are you sure you've thought this thing
through?
Ross  It's laundry. The thinking through is minimal.
Chandler  It's just you and Rachel, just the two of you? This is a date. You're
going on a date.
Ross  Nuh-uh.
Chandler  Yuh-huh.
Ross  So what're you saying here? I should shave again, pick up some wine, what?
Chandler  Well, you may wanna rethink the dirty underwear. This is basically the
first time she's gonna see your underwearyou want it to be dirty?
Ross  (sheepish) No.
Chandler  Oh, and uh, the fabric softener?
Ross  Ok, ok, now what is wrong with my Snuggles? What, it says I'm a
sensitive, warm kinda guy, you know, like a warm, fuzzy bear. Ok, I can pick something
else up on the way.
Chandler  There you go.
[Scene  A fancy restaurant, Joey and Monica are there, meeting Angela and Bob, who
Monica thinks is Angela's brother.]
Monica  Thank you. So what does this Bob guy look like? Is he tall? Short?
Joey  Yep.
Monica  Which?
Joey  Which what?
Monica  You've never met Bob, have you?
Joey  No, but he's...
Monica  Oh my god, Joey, for all we know this guy could be horribly...
Angela  Hey, Joey.
Monica  ...horribly attractive. I'll be shutting up now.
[Scene  Central Perk, Chandler and Phoebe are there, both ready to break up with their
significant others.]
Chandler  Where are they? Where are they?
Phoebe  This is nice. We never do anything just the two of us.
Chandler  It's great. Maybe tomorrow we can rent a car and run over some
puppies.
Phoebe  Eww, I don't wanna do that.
Chandler  Here we go.
Phoebe  Ok, have a good break-up.
Chandler  Hey, Janice.
Janice  Oh, my god, I am so glad you called me. I had the most supremely awful
day.
Chandler  Hey, that's not good. Can I get an espresso and a latte over here,
please?
Janice  We got the proofs back from that photo shoot, you know, the one with the
little vegetables. Anyway, they pretty much sucked, so, I blew off the rest of the day,
and I went shopping...(looks through her bags)... and I got you, I'm looking, I'm looking,
I'm looking, I got you...
Chandler  What?
Janice  What?
Chandler  (covering) What... did you get me there?
Janice  I got you...these. (pulls out a pair of socks)
Chandler  Bullwinkle socks. That's so sweet.
Janice  Well, I knew you had the Rockys, and so I figured, you know, you can
wear Bullwinkle and Bullwinkle, or you can wear Rocky and Rocky,or, you can mix and match,
moose and squirrel. Whatever you want.
Chandler  That's great.
Chandler  Well, I'm gonna get another espresso. Can I get you another latte?
Janice  (holding the full cup) No, no, I'm still working on mine.
Chandler  That's it?
Phoebe  Yeah, it was really hard.
Chandler  Oh, yeah, that hug looked pretty brutal.
Phoebe  Ok, you weren't there.
[Scene  The Launderama, Rachel is there, waiting for Ross. An old woman takes Rachel's
clothes off the machine and begins loading it with her things.]
Woman  Comin' through. Move, move.
Rachel  Oh, 'scuse me. I was kinda using that machine.
Woman  Yeah, well, now you're kinda not.
Rachel  But I saved it. I put my basket on top.
Woman  Oh, I'm sorry, is that your basket? It's really pretty. Unfortunately, I
don't see suds.
Rachel  What?
Woman  No suds, no save. Ok?
Ross  What's goin' on?
Rachel  Hi, uh, nothing. That horrible woman just took my machine.
Ross  Was your basket on top?
Rachel  Yeah, but, there were no suds.
Ross  So?
Rachel  Well, you know, no suds, no save.
Ross  No suds? Excuse me, hold on a second. (to woman) That's my friend's
machine.
Woman  Hey, hey, hey, her stuff wasn't in it.
Ross  Hey, hey, hey, that's not the rule and you know it.
Ross  (to the crowd in the laundromat) All right, show's over. Nothing to see
here. (to Rachel) Ok, let's do laundry.
Rachel  That was amazing. I can't even send back soup.
Ross  Well, that's because you're such a sweet, gentle, uh...Do you, uh, do
you...Oh, hey, uh you must need detergent.
Rachel  What's that?
Ross  Uberveiss. It's new, it's German, it's extra-tough.
Ross  Rach, do you uh, are you gonna separate those?
Rachel  Oh god. Oh, am I being like a total laundry spaz? I mean, am I supposed
to use like one machine for shirts and another machine for pants?
Ross  Rach, have you never done this before?
Rachel  Well, not myself, but I know other people that have. Ok, you caught me.
I'm a laundry virgin.
Ross  Uh, well, don't worry, I'll use the gentle cycle. Ok, um, basically you
wanna use one machine for all your whites, a whole nother machine for colors, and a third
for your uh, your uh, delicates, and that would be your bras and your under-panty things.
Rachel  (holds a pair of panties in front of Ross) Ok, Well, what about these
are white cotton panties. Would they go with whites or delicates?
Ross  (visibly nervous) Uh, that, that, that would be a judgment call.
[Scene  Fancy restaurant, Monica, Joey, Angela, and Bob are seated at the table.]
Monica  (to Joey) He is so cute. (to Angela and Bob) So, where did you guys grow
up?
Angela  Brooklyn Heights.
Bob  Cleveland.
Monica  How, how did that happen?
Joey  Oh my god.
Monica  What?
Joey  I suddenly had the feeling that I was falling. But I'm not.
[Scene  Fancy restaurant, Joey and Bob are talking.]
Joey  So, you and Angela, huh?
Bob  Yep. Pretty much.
Joey  You're a lucky man. You know what I miss the most about her? That cute
nibbly noise when she eats. Like a happy little squirrel, or a weasel.
Bob  Huh, I never really noticed.
Joey  Oh, yeah, yeah, listen for it.
Bob  Monica, Monica is great.
Joey  Yeah, but it's not gonna last. She's too much for me in bed. Sexually.
[Scene  The ladies' bathroom at the restaurant, Monica and Angela are talking.]
Monica  I've gotta tell you, Bob is terrific.
Angela  Yeah, isn't he?
Monica  It is so great to meet a guy who is smart and funny, and has an
emotional age beyond, like eight.
Angela  You know what else? He's unbelievable in bed.
Monica  Wow. My brother never even told me when he lost his virginity.
Angela  Huh. That's nice.
[Scene  Central Perk, Phoebe is coaching Chandler on how to break up with Janice.]
Phoebe  Ok, you can do this. It's just like pulling off a Band-aid. Just do it
really fast, and then the wound is exposed.
Chandler  Janice. Hi, Janice. Ok, here we go. I don't think we should go out
anymore. Janice.
Janice  All right. Well, there you go. (she gets extremely wound up, and begins
to try and calm herself down) Stop it, stop it, stop it.
[Scene  The laundromat.]
Rachel  Ok, I know this is gonna sound really stupid, but I feel that if I can
do this, you know, if I can actually do my own laundry, there isn't anything I can't do.
Ross  That does not sound stupid to me. You know, it's like the first time I had
to make dinner for myself, after Carol left me? (the buzzer on the washer goes off) I'm
sorry, that's all the time we have. Next on Ross...(opens up the washer) Uh-oh.
Rachel  What uh-oh?
Ross  (not wanting to tell her) Uh-oh, uh-oh, the laundry's done. It's, uh, it's
a song. The laundry song that we sing. (singing) Uh-oh the laundry's done, uh-oh, uh-oh.
Rachel  Ross, what's the matter?
Ross  Nothing, nothing. Lee-lo, the laundry's done.
Rachel  Come on, show me.
Ross  All right, all right, it's just that you left a red sock in with all your
whites, and now, everything's kinda pink.
Rachel  Oh, everything's pink.
Ross  Yeah, uh, except for the red sock, which is still red. I'm sorry, please
don't be upset, it could happen to anyone.
Rachel  Except it didn't. It happened to me. Oh, god, I'm gonna look like a big
marshmallow peep. What am I doing? What am I doing? My father's right. I can't live on my
own! I can't even do laundry!
[Scene  The fancy restaurant, Angela has her hand in Bob's shirt, and Monica is very
uncomfortable.]
Monica  Something went wrong with Underdog, and they couldn't get his head to
inflate. So anyway, um, his head is like flopping down Broadway, right, and I'm just
thinking... how inappropriate this is. Um, I've got something in my eye, uh, Joey, could
we check it in the light, please?
Monica  Oh my god.
Joey  What?
Monica  Hello! Were we at the same table? It's like... cocktails in Appalachia.
Joey  Come on, they're close.
Monica  Close? She's got her tongue in his ear.
Joey  Oh, like you've never gotten a little rambunctious with Ross.
Monica  Joey, this is sick, it's disgusting, it's, it'snot really true, is
it?
Joey  Well, who's to say what's true? I mean...
Monica  Oh my god, what were you thinking?
Joey  All right, look, I'm not proud of this, ok? Well, maybe I am a little.
Monica  (hits him lightly) Oh!
Joey  Ow!
Monica  (leaving) I'm outta here.
Joey  Wait, wait, wait. You want him, I want her. He likes you.
Monica  Really?
Joey  Yeah. I'm thinking, if we put our heads together, between the two of us,
we can break them up.
Monica  I'm so sorry, I can't believe I did this, but I couldn't stop laughing
at your Norman Mailer story.
Joey  Uh, waiter, one more plate of chicken wings over here.
[Scene  Central Perk, Chandler is still trying to ease things over with Janice, and
there are about a dozen empty Espresso cups in front of him. He is extremely wired.]
Chandler  Here's the thing, Janice. You know, I mean, it's like we're different.
I'm like the bing, bing, bing. You're like the boom, boom, (Chandler flails his hand out
and hits Janice in the eye)... boom.
Janice  Ow!
Chandler  Oh, my god, I'm so sorry. Are you ok?
Janice  Ow. Um, it's just my lens. It's just my lens. I'll be right back.
Chandler  (to Phoebe) I hit her in the eye! I hit her in the eye! This is the
worst break-up in the history of the world.
Phoebe  Oh my god. (Chandler downs another espresso.) How many of those have you
had?
Chandler  Oh, I don't know, a million?
Phoebe  Chandler, easy, easy. Go to your happy place. La la la la la la la.
Chandler  I'm fine.
Phoebe  All right.
Chandler  I'm not fine. Here she comes.
Phoebe  Wait here. Breathe.
Chandler  How do you do that?
Phoebe  It's like a gift.
Chandler  We should always always break up together.
Phoebe  Oh, I'd like that.
[Scene  The Launderama. Rachel is sorting her now-pink clothes.]
Ross  You got the clothes clean. Now that's the important part.
Rachel  Oh, I guess. Except everything looks like jammies now.
Rachel  Whoa, I'm sorry. Excuse me. We had this cart.
Woman  Yeah, well, I had a 24-inch waist. You lose things. Now come on, get
outta my way.
Rachel  I'm sorry, you know, maybe I wasn't being clear. Uh, this is our cart.
Woman  Hey, hey, hey there aren't any clothes in it.
Rachel  Hey, hey, hey, hey, quit making up rules!
Woman  Let go!
Rachel  All right, listen, missy. If you want this cart, you're gonna have to
take me with it!
Rachel  (to Ross) Yes! Did you see that?
Ross  You were incredible! Brand new woman, ladies and gentlemen.
Rachel  I could not have done this without you.
Ross  Ok, um, uh, more clothes in the dryer? (Ross turns and bangs his head on
an open dryer door.) I'm fine, I'm fine.
Rachel  Are you sure?
Ross  No.
[Scene  Central Perk, Ross, Rachel, and Phoebe are there. Ross has an icepack to his
head.]
Rachel  Oh, are you sure you're ok?
Ross  Yeah.
Rachel  Does it still hurt?
Ross  Yeah.
Phoebe  (seeing Rachel's clothes) What a neat idea. All your clothes match. I'm
gonna do this.
Monica  Hi.
Phoebe  Hey, how'd it go?
Joey  Excellent.
Monica  We ripped that couple apart, and kept the pieces for ourselves.
Ross  What a beautiful story. Hey, I'm fine by the way.
Monica  (notices his head) Oh, I'm sorry.
Rachel  Where's Chandler?
Phoebe  Oh, he needed some time to grieve.
Chandler  I'm free! I'm free!
Phoebe  That oughta do it.
Rachel  (reading the program) Ooh! Look! Look! Look! Look, there's Joey's
picture! This is so exciting!
Chandler  You can always spot someone who's never seen one of his plays before.
Notice, no fear, no sense of impending doom...
Phoebe  The exclamation point in the title scares me. (Gesturing) Y'know, it's
not just Freud, it's Freud!
Ross  Oh, shhh, shh. Magic is about to happen.
Joey  Vell, Eva, ve've done some excellent vork here, and I vould have to say,
your pwoblem is qviiite clear. (He goes into a song and dance number.)
[Scene  The Theater, the play has ended and everyone is applauding.  As soon as
the cast leaves, the gang all groan and sit down heavily.]
Rachel  God. I feel violated.
Monica  Did anybody else feel they just wanted to peel the skin off their body,
to have something else to do?
Chandler  (staring at a woman across the room) Ross, ten o'clock.
Ross  Is it? Feels like two.
Chandler  No, ten o'clock.
Ross  What?
Chandler  (sighs and gestures to explain) There's a beautiful woman at eight,
nine, ten o'clock!
Ross  Oh. Hel-lo!
Chandler  She's amazing! She makes the women that I dream about look like short,
fat, bald men!
Monica  Well, go over to her! She's not with anyone.
Chandler  Oh yeah, and what would my opening line be? 'Excuse me.
Blarrglarrghh.'
Rachel  Oh, c'mon. She's a person, you can do it!
Chandler  Oh please, could she be more out of my league? Ross,
back me up here.
Ross  He could never get a woman like that in a million years.
Chandler  Thank you, buddy.
Phoebe  Oh, oh, but y'know, you always see these really beautiful women with
these really nothing guys, you could be one of those guys.
Monica  You could do that!
Chandler  Y'think?
All  Yeah!
Chandler  Oh God, I can't believe I'm even considering this... I'm very very
aware of my tongue...
Ross  C'mon! C'mon!
Chandler  Here goes. (He walks over to her but just stands there.)
Aurora  ...Yes?
Chandler  Hi.... um... okay, next word... would be... Chandler! Chandler is my
name, and, uh...(He clears his throat noisily)...hi.
Aurora  Yes, you said that.
Chandler  Yes, yes I did, but what I didn't say was what I was about to say,
what I wanted to say was, uh... would you like to go out with me sometime, thankyou,
goodnight. (He walks back to the others but she calls him back.)
Aurora  Chandler?
All  Hey! You're in a play! I didn't know you could dance! You had a beard!
Joey  Whadja think?
All  ...Hey! You're in a play! I didn't know you could dance! You had a beard!
Joey  C'mon, you guys, it wasn't that bad. It was better than that thing I did
with the trolls, at least you got to see my head.
All  (admitting) Saw your head. Saw your head.
Chandler  (running back) She said yes!! She said yes!! (To Joey) Awful play,
man. Whoah. (To All) Her name's Aurora, and she's Italian, and she pronounces my name
'Chand-lrr'. 'Chand-lrr'. I think I like it better that way. (To Joey) Oh, listen, the
usher gave me this to give to you. (He fishes a card out of his pocket.)
Rachel  What is it?
Joey  The Estelle Leonard Talent Agency. Wow, an agency left me its card! Maybe
they wanna sign me!
Phoebe  Based on this play? ...Based on this play!
[Scene  Central Perk, everyone else is there as Chandler enters.]
Chandler  Hey, kids.
All  Hey.
Phoebe  (reading Monica's palm) No, 'cause this line is passion, and this is...
just a line.
Chandler  Well, I can't believe I've been here almost seven seconds and you
haven't asked me how my date went.
Monica  Oh, right, right. How was your date, 'Chand-lrr'?
Chandler  It was unbelievable. I-I've never met anyone like her. She's had the
most amazing life! She was in the Israeli army...
Aurora  ...Luckily none of the bullets hit the engine block. So, we made it
to the border, but just barely, and I- ...I've been talking about myself all night long,
I'm sorry. What about you? Tell me one of your stories.
Chandler  Alright. Once I got on the subway, right, and it was at night, and I
rode it all the way to Brooklyn... just for the hell of it.
Aurora  ...All of a sudden we realised we were in Yammon.
Chandler  Oh, I'm sorry, so 'we' is?
Aurora  'We' would be me and Rick.
Chandler  Who's Rick?
Aurora  My husband.
Chandler  Oh, so you're divorced?
Aurora  No.
Chandler  Oh, I'm sorry, then you're widowed?...Hopefully?
Aurora  No, I'm still married.
Chandler  So tell me, how do- how do you think your husband would feel about you
sitting here with me?...Sliding your foot so far up my pant leg you can count the change
in my pocket?
Aurora  Don't worry. I imagine he'd be okay with you because really, he's okay
with Ethan.
Chandler  Ethan? There's, there's an Ethan?
Aurora  Mmmm... Ethan is my... boyfriend.
Chandler  So explain something to me here, uh, what kind of a relationship do
you imagine us having if you already have a husband and a boyfriend?
Aurora  I suppose mainly sexual.
Chandler  ...Hm.
Chandler  What 'not work out'? I'm seeing her again on Thursday. Didn't you
listen to the story?
Monica  Didn't you listen to the story? I mean, this is twisted! How could you
get involved with a woman like this?
Phoebe  Oh, yeah. That is not true. Ross, is this your fantasy?
Ross  No, of course not! (Thinks) ...Yeah, yeah, it is.
Monica  What? So you guys don't mind going out with someone else who's going out
with someone else?
Joey  I couldn't do it.
Monica  Good for you, Joey.
Joey  When I'm with a woman, I need to know that I'm going out with
more people than she is.
Ross  Well, y'know, monogamy can be a, uh, tricky concept. I mean,
anthropologically speaking-
Ross  Fine. Fine, alright, now you'll never know.
Monica  We're kidding. C'mon, tell us!
All  Yeah! C'mon!
Ross  Alright. There's a theory, put forth by Richard Leakey-
[Scene  Monica and Rachel's, Rachel is there as enter except Joey enter.]
Rachel  Tah-daaah!
Chandler  Are we greeting each other this way now? 'Cause I like that.
Rachel  Look! I cleaned! I did the windows, I did the floors... I even used all
the attachments on the vacuum, except that little round one with the bristles, I don't
know what that's for.
Ross  Oh yeah, nobody knows. And we're not supposed to ask.
Rachel  Well, whaddya think?
All  Very clean! It looks great! Terrific!
Monica  ...Oh! I-I see you moved the green ottoman.
All  Uh-oh...
Monica  How-how did that happen?
Rachel  I dunno.. I-I thought it looked better there. And I- and also, it's an
extra seat around the coffee table.
Monica  Yeah, yeah, it's interesting.. but y'know what? Just for fun, let's see
what it looked like in the old spot. (She moves it.) Alright, just to compare. Let's see.
Well, it looks good there too. Let's just leave it there for a while.
Phoebe  (to Rachel) I can't believe you tried to move the green ottoman.
Chandler  Thank God you didn't try to fan out the magazines. I mean, she'll
scratch your eyes right out.
Monica  You guys, I am not that bad!
Phoebe  Yeah, you are, Monica. Remember when I lived with you? You were like, a
little, y'know, (psycho) Ree! Ree! Ree! Ree!
Monica  That is so unfair!
Ross  Oh c'mon! When we were kids, yours was the only Raggedy Ann doll that
wasn't raggedy!
Monica  Okay, so I'm responsible, I'm organised. But hey, I can be a kook.
Ross  Alright, you madcap gal. Try to imagine this. The phone bill arrives, but
you don't pay it right away.
Monica  Why not?
Ross  Because you're a kook! Instead you wait until they send you a notice.
Monica  I could do that.
Rachel  Okay, uh, you let me go grocery shopping, and I buy laundry detergent,
but it's not the one with the easy-pour spout.
Monica  Why would someone do that?! ...One might wonder.
Chandler  Someone's left a glass on the coffee table. There's no coaster. It's a
cold drink, it's a hot day. Little beads of condensation are inching their way closer and
closer to the surface of the wood...
Monica  STOP IT!! ...Oh my God. It's true! Who am I?
Ross  Monica? You're Mom.
Phoebe  Ree! Ree! Ree! Ree! Ree!
Joey  (on phone) Uh huh.. uh huh... oh my God! Okay! Okay, I'll be there! (He
hangs up and to all.) That was my agent. (He tosses and catches the phone.) My agent has
just gotten me a job...in the new Al Pacino movie!
All  Oh my God! Whoah!
Monica  Well, what's the part?
Joey  Can you believe this? Al Pacino! This guy's the reason I became an actor!
"I'm out of order? Pfeeeh. You're out of order! This whole courtroom's out of
order!"
Phoebe  Seriously, what-what's the part?
Joey  "Just when I thought I was out, they pull me back in!"
Ross  C'mon, seriously, Joey, what's the part?
Joey  ...I'm his (mumbles)
Rachel  ..You're, you're 'mah mah mah' what?
Joey  ...I'm his butt double. 'Kay? I play Al Pacino's butt. Alright? He goes
into the shower, and then- I'm his butt.
Monica  (trying not to laugh) Oh my God.
Joey  C'mon, you guys. This is a real movie, and Al Pacino's in it, and that's
big!
Chandler  Oh no, it's terrific, it's... it's... y'know, you deserve this, after
all your years of struggling, you've finally been able to crack your way into
showbusiness.
Joey  Okay, okay, fine! Make jokes, I don't care! This is a big break for me!
Ross  You're right, you're right, it is...So you gonna invite us all to the big
opening?
Monica  Alright, alright, alright...
Joey  Here. I need to borrow some moisturizer.
Monica  For what?
Joey  Whaddya think? Today's the big day!
Monica  Oh my God. Okay, go into the bathroom, use whatever you want, just don't
ever tell me what you did in there.
Joey  Thank you! (He goes into the bathroom.)
Chandler  Where's Joey? His mom's on the phone.
Monica  He's in the bathroom. I don't think you wanna go in there!
Chandler  C'mon, we're roommates! (He goes into the bathroom, screams, and runs
back out.) My eyes!! My eyes!!
Monica  I warned you...
Rachel  Who is being loud?
Chandler  Oh, that would be Monica. Hey, listen, I wanna borrow a coupla things,
Aurora spent the night, I really wanna make her breakfast.
Monica  Oh, you got the whole night, huh?
Chandler  Yeah, well, I only have twenty minutes until Ethan, so, y'know.. (He
starts to raid the fridge.)
Rachel  Ooh, do I sense a little bit of resentment?
Chandler  No, no resentment, believe me, it's worth it. 'Kay? Y'know in a
relationship you have these key moments that you know you'll remember for the rest of your
life? Well, every- single- second is like that with Aurora.. and I've just wasted about
thirty-five of them talking to you people, so, uh.. Monica, can you help me with the door?
(He has armloads of stuff.)
Monica  Sure. Oh, um, Chandler? Y'know, the-the old Monica would-would remind
you to scrub that Teflon pan with a plastic brush...But I'm not gonna do that.
[Scene  A Film Set, Joey is entering for his scene.]
Director  (on phone)...Dammit, hire the girl! (He hangs up the phone.)
Okay, everybody ready?
Joey  Uh, listen, I just wanna thank you for this great opportunity.
Director  Lose the robe.
Joey  Me?
Director  That would work.
Joey  Right. Okay. Losing the robe. (He takes off the robe.) And the robe is
lost.
Director  Okay, everybody, we'd like to get this in one take, please. Let's roll
it.. water's working (The shower starts).. and... action.
Director  And cut. Hey, Butt Guy, what the hell are you doing?
Joey  Well, I'm- I'm showering.
Director  No, that was clenching.
Joey  Oh. Well, the way I see it, the guy's upset here, y'know? I mean, his
wife's dead, his brother's missing... I think his butt would be angry here.
Director  I think his butt would like to get this shot before lunch. Once again,
rolling... water working... and action....and cut. What was that?
Joey  I was going for quiet desperation. But if you have to ask...
[Scene  Chandler and Joey's, Aurora and Chandler are in bed in Chandler's room.]
Chandler  God, I love these fingers...
Aurora  Thank you.
Chandler  No, actually I meant my fingers. Look at 'em, look at how happy they
are.
Aurora  (moves Chandler's arm and look at his watch.) Oh my God, I'm late. (She
starts to get up.)
Chandler  Oh no nonononononnononono, don't go.. (He kisses her and pulls her
back down.)
Aurora  Okay.
Chandler  Don't go.
Aurora  Okay. Oh no, I have to.
Chandler  (to himself) Too bad, she's leaving.
Aurora  (getting up and dressing) I'm sorry. He'll be waiting for me.
Chandler  Well, I thought- I thought you talked to Rick.
Aurora  It's not Rick.
Chandler  What, Ethan? He got to spend the whole day with you!
Aurora  No, it's-it's Andrew.
Chandler  I know there'll be many moments in the years to come when I'll regret
asking the following question, but- And Andrew is?
Aurora  He's... new.
Chandler  Oh, so what you're saying is you're not completely fulfilled by Rick,
Ethan and myself?
Aurora  No, that's not exactly what I was..
Chandler  Well, y'know, most women would kill for three guys like us.
Aurora  So what do you want?
Chandler  You.
Aurora  You have me!
Chandler  Nono, just you.
Aurora  Whaddyou mean?
Chandler  Lose the other guys.
Aurora  ...Like, ...all of them?
Chandler  C'mon, we're great together, why not?
Aurora  Why can't we just have what we have now? Why can't we just talk, and
laugh, and make love, without feeling obligated to one another... and up until tonight I
thought that's what you wanted too.
Chandler  ...Well, y'know, part of me wants that, but it's like I'm two guys,
y'know? I mean, one guy's going 'Shut up! This is great!' But there's this other guy.
Actually it's the same guy that wells up every time that Grinch's heart grows three sizes
and breaks that measuring device... And he's saying, y'know, 'This is too hard! Get out!
Get out!'
Aurora  So... which one of the two guys will you listen to?
Chandler  I don't know, I-I have to listen to both of them, they don't exactly
let each other finish...
Aurora  Which one?
Chandler  ...The second guy.
Aurora  (gets up to leave) Well, call me if you change your mind.
Chandler  Sorry, the first guy runs the lips.
[Scene  Monica and Rachel's, Ross is trying to comfort Chandler.  Joey is absent.]
All  Hey!
Monica  Hey, waitwait, aren't you the guy that plays the butt in the new Al
Pacino movie?
Joey  Nope.
Ross  No? What happened, big guy?
Chandler  (to Ross) "Big guy?"
Ross  It felt like a 'big guy' moment.
Joey  I got fired.
All  Oh!
Joey  Yeah, they said I acted too much with it. I told everybody about this! Now
everybody's gonna go to the theatre, expecting to see me, and...
Rachel  Oh, Joey, you know what, no-one is gonna be able to tell.
Joey  My mom will.
Chandler  Something so sweet and...disturbing about that.
Joey  Y'know, I've done nothing but crappy plays for six years. And I finally
get my shot, and I blow it!
Monica  Maybe this wasn't your shot.
Ross  Yeah, I mean... I think when it's your shot, y'know, you-you know it's
your shot. Did it... feel like your shot..?
Joey  Hard to tell, I was naked.
Phoebe  No, I don't think this was your shot. I mean, I don't even think you
just get one shot. I really believe big things are gonna happen for you, I do! You've
gotta just keep thinking about the day that some kid is gonna run up to his friends and go
'I got the part! I got the part! I'm gonna be Joey Tribbiani's ass!'.
Joey  Yeah? That's so nice! (They hug.)
Monica  I'm sorry, Joey. I'm gonna go to bed, guys.
All  Night.
Rachel  Uh, Mon, you-you gonna leave your shoes out here?
Monica  (determined) Uh-huh!
Rachel  Really? Just casually strewn about in that reckless haphazard manner?
Monica  Doesn't matter, I'll get 'em tomorrow. Or not. Whenever. (He goes to her
room.)
Ross  She is a kook.
Monica  (hums for a while, then gives up, and in her head) If it bothers you
that much, just go out and get the shoes. No. Don't do this. This is stupid! I don't have
to prove anything, I'm gonna go get them...But then everyone will know. Unless I get them,
and then wake up really early and put them back! ...I need help! (She buries her head
in her pillow.)
[Scene  Central Perk, Rachel is introducing Phoebe, who is playing her guitar for the
crowd.]
Rachel  Everybody? Shh, shhh. Uhhh... Central Perk is proud to present the music
of Miss Phoebe Buffay.
Phoebe  Hi. Um, I want to start with a song thats about that moment when you
suddenly realize what life is all about. OK, here we go. (plays a chord, then the lights
go out) OK, thank you very much.
[Scene  The ATM vestibule of a bank, Chandler is inside. The lights go out, and he
realizes he is trapped inside.]
Chandler  Oh, great. This is just...
[Scene  Monica and Rachel's, Monica is on the phone with her mother. Phoebe, Rachel,
and Ross are there.]
Rachel  Wow, this is so cool, you guys. The entire city is blacked out!
Monica  Mom says it's all of Manhattan, parts of Brooklyn and Queens, and they
have no idea when it's coming back on.
Rachel  Wow, you guys, this is big.
Monica  (into phone) Pants and a sweater? Why, mom? Who am I gonna meet in a
blackout? Power company guys? Eligible looters? Could we talk about this later? OK. (hangs
up)
Phoebe  Can I borrow the phone? I want to call my apartment and check on my
grandma. (to Monica) What's my number?
Phoebe  Well, I never call me.
[Scene  ATM vestibule, Jill Goodacre is on the cellular phone. Chandler's thoughts are
in italics.]
Chandler  Oh my God, it's that Victoria's Secret model. Something...
something Goodacre.
Chandler  She's right, it's Jill. Jill Goodacre. Oh my God. I am trapped in
an ATM vestibule with Jill Goodacre! (pause) Is it a vestibule? Maybe it's an
atrium. Oh, yeah, that is the part to focus on, you idiot!
Jill  (on phone) Yeah, I'm fine. I'm just stuck at the bank, in an ATM
vestibule.
Chandler  Jill says vestibule... I'm going with vestibule.
Jill  (on phone) I'm fine. No, I'm not alone... I don't know, some guy.
Chandler  Oh! Some guy. Some guy. 'Hey Jill, I saw you with some guy last
night. Yes, he was some guy.
[Scene  Monica's apartment, Joey enters with a menorah, the candles lit.]
Joey  Hi everyone.
Ross  And officiating at tonight's blackout, is Rabbi Tribbiani.
Joey  Well, Chandler's old roomate was Jewish, and these are the only candles we
have, so... Happy Chanukah, everyone.
Phoebe  (at window) Eww, look. Ugly Naked Guy lit a bunch of candles.
Rachel  That had to hurt!
[Scene  ATM vestibule.]
Chandler  Alright, alright, alright. It's been fourteen and a half minutes
and you still have not said one word. Oh God, do something. Just make contact, smile!
Chandler  There you go!
Chandler  You're definitely scaring here.
Jill  (awkwardly) Would you like to call somebody? (offering phone)
Chandler  Yeah, about 300 guys I went to high school with. Yeah, thanks.
(takes phone)
[Scene  Monica and Rachel's, The phone rings; it's Chandler.]
Monica  Hello?
Chandler  Hey, it's me.
Monica  (to everyone) It's Chandler! (on phone) Are you OK?
Chandler  Yeah, I'm fine. (trying to cover up what he is saying) I'm trppd in an
ATM vstbl wth Jll Gdcr.
Monica  What?
Chandler  I'm trppd... in an ATM vstbl... wth Jll Gdcr!
Monica  I have no idea what you just said.
Chandler  (angry) Put Joey on the phone.
Joey  What's up man?
Chandler  I'm trppd... in an ATM vstbl... wth JLL GDCR.
Joey  (to everyone) Oh my God! He's trapped in an ATM vestibule with Jill
Goodacre! (on phone) Chandler, listen. (says something intentionally garbled)
Chandler  Yeah, like that thought never entered my mind.
[Scene  Monica and Rachel's, time has passed. The five are sitting around the coffee
table talking.]
Rachel  Alright, somebody.
Monica  OK, I'll go. OK, senior year of college... on a pool table.
All  Whoooaa!
Ross  That's my sister.
Joey  OK... my weirdest place would have to be... the women's room on the second
floor of the New York CIty public library.
Monica  Oh my God! What were you doing in a library?
Ross  Pheebs, what about you?
Phoebe  Oh... Milwaukee.
Rachel  Um... Ross?
Ross  Disneyland, 1989, 'It's a Small World After All.'
All  No way!
Ross  The ride broke down. So, Carol and I went behind a couple of those
mechanical Dutch children... then they fixed the ride, and we were asked never to return
to the Magic Kingdom.
Phoebe  Oh, Rachel.
Rachel  Oh come on, I already went.
Monica  You did not go!
All  Come on.
Rachel  Oh, alright. The weirdest place would have to be... (sigh)... oh, the
foot of the bed.
Ross  Step back.
Joey  We have a winner!
Rachel  I just never had a relationship with that kind of passion, you know,
where you have to have somebody right there, in the middle of a theme park.
Ross  Well, it was the only thing to do there that didn't have a line.
Rachel  There, well, see? Barry wouldn't even kiss me on a miniature golf
course.
Ross  Come on.
Rachel  No, he said we were holding up the people behind us.
Ross  (sarcastically) And you didn't marry him because...?
Rachel  I mean, do you think there are people who go through life never having
that kind of...
Ross  Probably. But you know, I'll tell you something. Passion is way overrated.
Rachel  Yeah right.
Ross  It is. Eventually, it kind of... burns out. But hopefully, what you're
left with is trust, and security, and... well, in the case of my ex-wife, lesbianism. So,
you know, for all of those people who miss out on that passion... thing, there's all that
other good stuff.
Rachel  (sigh) OK.
Ross  But, um... I don't think that's going to be you.
Rachel  You don't.
Ross  Uh-uh. See, I see.... big passion in your future.
Rachel  Really?
Ross  Mmmm.
Rachel  You do?
Ross  I do.
Rachel  Oh Ross, you're so great. (she playfully rubs his head and gets up)
Joey  It's never gonna happen.
Ross  (innocently) What?
Joey  You and Rachel.
Ross  (acts surprised) What? (pause) Why not?
Joey  Because you waited too long to make your move, and now you're in the friend
zone.
Ross  No, no, no. I'm not in the zone.
Joey  Ross, you're mayor of the zone.
Ross  I'm taking my time, alright? I'm laying the groundwork. Yeah. I mean,
every day I get just a little bit closer to...
Joey  Priesthood! Look Ross, I'm telling you, she has no idea what you're
thinking. If you don't ask her out soon you're going to end up stuck in the zone forever.
Ross  I will, I will. See, I'm waiting for the right moment. (Joey looks at him)
What? What, now?
Joey  Yeeeeaaaahhh! What's messing you up? The wine? The candles? The moonlight?
You've just got to go up to her and say, 'Rachel, I think that...' (Rachel comes into the
room behind them)
Ross  Shhhh!
Rachel  What are you shushing?
Ross  We're shushing... because... we're trying to hear something. Listen.
(everyone is silent) Don't you hear that?
Rachel  Ahhhh!
Ross  See?
Rachel  Huh. (she agrees, but looks very confused)
[Scene  ATM vestibule.]
Jill  Would you like some gum?
Chandler  Um, is it sugarless?
Jill  (checks) Sorry, it's not.
[Scene  Monica's apartment, Phoebe is singing.]
Phoebe  (singing) New York City has no power, and the milk is getting sour. But
to me it is not scary, 'cause I stay away from dairy.... la la la, la la, la la... (she
writes the lyrics down)
Ross  (to Joey) OK, here goes.
Joey  Are you going to do it?
Ross  I'm going to do it.
Joey  Do you want any help?
Ross  You come out there, you're a dead man.
Joey  Good luck, man.
Ross  Thanks. (Joey hugs him) OK.
Joey  OK. (Ross goes out on the balcony to talk to Rachel)
Joey  Hey, where are you going?
Monica  Outside.
Joey  You can't go out there.
Monica  Why not?
Joey  Because of... the reason.
Monica  And that would be?
Joey  I, um, can't tell you.
Monica  Joey, what's going on?
Joey  OK, you've got to promise that you'll never, ever tell Ross that I told
you.
Monica  About what?
Joey  He's planning your birthday party.
Monica  Oh my God! I love him!
Joey  (as Phoebe enters) You'd better act surprised.
Phoebe  About what?
Monica  My surprise party!
Phoebe  What surprise party?
Monica  Oh stop it. Joey already told me.
Phoebe  Well, he didn't tell me.
Joey  Hey, don't look at me. This is Ross's thing.
Phoebe  This is so typical. I'm always the last one to know everything.
Monica  No, you are not. We tell you stuff.
Phoebe  Yuh-huh! I was the last one to know when Chandler got bitten by the
peacock at the zoo. I was the last one to know when you had a crush on Joey when he was
moving in. (Monica gestures at Phoebe to shut up; Joey looks surprised but pleased) Looks
like I was second to last.
[Scene  Monica and Rachel's Balcony, Ross and Rachel are talking.]
Rachel  Hmmm... this is so nice.
Ross  OK, I have a question. Well, actually, it's not so much a question as..
more of a general wondering... ment.
Rachel  OK.
Ross  OK. Here goes. For a while now, I've been wanting to, um....
Rachel  Ohhh!!!! (looking at something behind Ross)
Ross  Yes, yes, that's right...
Rachel  Oh, look at the little cat! (a small kitten is on the roof behind Ross)
Ross  What? (the cat jumps on his shoulders) Ow!
Monica, Joey, and Phoebe  (singing) I'm on top of the world,
looking down on creation and the only explanation I can find, is the wonders I've found
ever since...
[Scene  Monica and Rachel's, Phoebe is holding the cat, Monica is treating the
scratches on Ross' back. Joey is holding the menorah over the wound.]
Monica  (to Ross) This is just Bactine. It won't hurt.
Joey  Sorry, that was wax.
Phoebe  Oh, poor little Tooty is scared to death. We should find his owner.
Ross  Why don't we just put 'poor little Tooty' out in the hall?
Rachel  During a blackout? He'd get trampled!
Ross  (nonchalantly) Yeah?
[Scene  ATM vestibule.]
Chandler  You know, on second thought, gum would be perfection. (Jill gives him
a stick of gum, and a strange look) 'Gum would be perfection'? 'Gum would be
perfection.' Could have said 'gum would be nice,' or 'I'll have a stick,' but no, no, no,
no. For me, gum is perfection. I loathe myself.
[Scene  The hallway of Monica's building. Phoebe and Rachel are trying to find the
cat's owner.]
Phoebe  (stops at a door) Oh no, the Mendels, they hate all living things,
right?
Rachel  Oh. (they knock at the next door, Mr. Heckles answers) Hi. We just found
this cat and we're looking for the owner.
Mr. Heckles  Er, yeah, it's mine.
Phoebe  (trying to hold back the struggling cat) He seems to hate you. Are you
sure?
Mr. Heckles  Yeah, it's my cat. Give me my cat.
Phoebe  Wait a minute. What's his name?
Mr. Heckles  Ehhhh... B-Buttons.
Rachel  Bob Buttons?
Mr. Heckles  Mmm. Bob Buttons. Here, Bob Buttons.
Phoebe  (the cat runs away from her) Oooh! You are a very bad man!
Mr. Heckles  (as Phoebe and Rachel leave) You owe me a cat.
[Scene  Rachel has gone off on her own to look for the cat's owner.]
Rachel  Here, kitty-kitty. Here kitty-kitty. Where did you go, little
kitty-kitty-kitty? Here kitty-kitty-kitty-kitty...
Paolo  (something Italian)
Rachel  Wow. (she exhales in amazement, blowing the candle out)
[Scene  Monica and Rachel's, Ross, Monica, and Joey are playing Monopoly.]
Ross  (rolling) Lucky sixes....
Rachel  (entering with Paolo, arm in arm) Everybody, this is Paolo. Paolo, I
want you to meet my friends. This is Monica.
Monica  (smitten) Hi!
Rachel  And Joey....
Monica  Hi!
Rachel  And Ross.
Monica  Hi!
Paolo  (something in Italian)
Rachel  (proudly) He doesn't speak much English.
Paolo  (pointing at game) Monopoly!
Rachel  Look at that!
Ross  (jealous) So, um... where did Paolo come from?
Rachel  Oh... Italy, I think.
Ross  No, I mean tonight, in the building. Suddenly. Into our lives.
Rachel  Well, the cat... the cat turned out to be Paolo's cat!
Ross  That, that is funny... (to Joey).... and Rachel keeps touching him.
Phoebe  Alright. I looked all over the building and I couldn't find the kitty
anywhere.
Rachel  Oh, I found him. He was Paolo's cat.
Phoebe  Ah! Well! There you go! Last to know again! And I'm guessing... since
nobody told me... this is Paolo.
Rachel  Ah, Paolo, this is Phoebe.
Paolo  (something in Italian, he is apparently attracted to Phoebe)
Phoebe  (smiling) You betcha!
[Scene  ATM vestibule.]
Chandler  (chewing gum) Ah, let's see. What next? Blow a bubble. A bubble's
good. It's got a... boyish charm, it's impish. Here we go.
Chandler  Nice going, imp. OK, it's OK. All I need to do is reach over and
put it in my mouth. (Chandler slyly grabs the gum from the wall and slides it back in
his mouth.)
Chandler  Good save! We're back on track, and I'm... (grimacing) ..chewing
someone else's gum. This is not my gum. Oh my God! Oh my God! And now you're
choking.
Jill  Are you alright?
Jill  My God, you're choking! (she runs over and gives him the Heimlich, the gum
flies from his mouth) That better?
Chandler  (gasping) Yes... thank you. That was... that was....
Jill  Perfection?
[Scene  Monica and Rachel's, Rachel and Paolo are at the window. Ross and Joey are
watching disgustedly.]
Paolo  (something romantic in Italian about Rachel and the stars)
Ross  (mocking Paolo) Blah blah blah, blah blah blah... blah blaaaaaah....
Ross  Wha-What did he say that was so funny?
Rachel  I have absolutely no idea.
Ross  That's... that's classic.
Rachel  (to Monica and Phoebe) Oh my God, you guys, what am I doing? What am I
doing? This is so un-me!
Monica  If you want, I'll do it.
Phoebe  I know, I just want to bite his bottom lip. (Rachel looks at her) But I
won't.
Rachel  God, the first time he smiled at me... those three seconds were more
exciting than three weeks in Bermuda with Barry.
Phoebe  You know, did you ride mopeds? 'Cause I've heard... (they stare at
her)... oh, I see... it's not about that right now. OK.
Rachel  Y'know, I know it's totally superficial and we have absolutely nothing
in common, and we don't even speak the same language but Goooooooddddddd....
Ross  Paolo. Hi.
Paolo  Ross!
Ross  Listen. Um, listen. Something you should... know... um, Rachel and I...
we're kind of a thing.
Paolo  Thing?
Ross  Thing, yes. Thing.
Paolo  Ah, you... have the sex?
Ross  No, no, no. Technically the... sex is not... being had, but that's... see,
that's not the point. See, um, the point is that... Rachel and I should be, er, together.
You know, and if you get in the.... um...
Paolo  Bed?
Ross  No, no, that's not where I was going. Er, if you get in the... way,
of us becoming a thing, then I would be, well, very sad.
Paolo  Oh!
Ross  Yeah! Se vice?
Paolo  Si.
Ross  So you do know a little English.
Paolo  Poco... a leetle.
Ross  Do you know the word crapweasel?
Paolo  No.
Ross  That's funny, because you know, you are a huge crapweasel!
[Scene  ATM vestibule, Chandler and Jill are sitting below the counter with two pens
dangling from their chains in front of them. Jill is showing Chandler how to swing the pen
around his head.]
Jill  Chandler, we've been here for an hour doing this! Now watch, it's easy.
Chandler  OK.
Jill  Ready? (she swings the pen around her head in a circle)
Jill  No, you've got to whip it.
[Scene  Monica and Rachel's, the gang is all sitting around the table.]
Phoebe  Oh, look look look. The last candle's about to burn out. 10, 9, 8, 7...
(time lapse)... negative 46, negative 47, negative 48.... (someone blows it out, the room
gets completely dark)
Ross  Thank you.
Phoebe  Thanks.
Ross  Kinda... spooky without any lights.
Joey  (does a maniacal laugh) Bwah-hah-hah!
Ross  OK, guys, guys? I have the definitive one. Mwwwooooo-hah-hah...
Ross  Oh.. oh... oh.
Joey  Hey Ross. This probably isn't the best time to bring it up, but you have
to throw a party for Monica.
[Scene  ATM vestibule, the power has come back on.]
Jill  Well, this has been fun.
Chandler  Yes. Yes, thanks for letting me use your phone... and for saving my
life.
Jill  Well, goodbye Chandler. I had a great blackout. (she kisses him on the
cheek) See ya.
Chandler  Hi, um, I'm account number 7143457. And, uh, I don't know if you got
any of that, but I would really like a copy of the tape.

With Help From
Chandler  Dehydrated Japanese noodles under fluorescent lights... does it get
better than this?
Shelley  Question. You're not dating anybody, are you, because I met somebody
who would be perfect for you.
Chandler  Ah, y'see, perfect might be a problem. Had you said 'co-dependent', or
'self-destructive'...
Shelley  Do you want a date Saturday?
Chandler  Yes please.
Shelley  Okay. He's cute, he's funny, he's-
Chandler  He's a he?
Shelley  Well yeah! ...Oh God. I- just- I thought- Good, Shelley. I'm just gonna
go flush myself down the toilet now...(backs out of the room) Okay, goodbye...
[Scene  Monica and Rachel's, everyone is there.)
Chandler  ...Couldn't enjoy a cup of noodles after that. I mean, is that
ridiculous? Can you believe she actually thought that?
Rachel  Um... yeah. Well, I mean, when I first met you, y'know, I thought maybe,
possibly, you might be...
Chandler  You did?
Rachel  Yeah, but then you spent Phoebe's entire birthday party talking to my
breasts, so then I figured maybe not.
Chandler  Huh. Did, uh... any of the rest of you guys think that when you first
met me?
Monica  I did.
Phoebe  Yeah, I think so, yeah.
Joey  Not me.
Ross  Nono, me neither. Although, uh, y'know, back in college, Susan Sallidor
did.
Chandler  You're kidding! Did you tell her I wasn't?
Ross  No. No, it's just 'cause, uh, I kinda wanted to go out with her too, so I
told her, actually, you were seeing Bernie Spellman... who also liked her, so...
Chandler  Well, this is fascinating. So, uh, what is it about me?
Phoebe  I dunno, 'cause you're smart, you're funny...
Chandler  Ross is smart and funny, d'you ever think that about him?
All  Yeah! Right!
Chandler  WHAT IS IT?!
Monica  Okay, I-I d'know, you-you just- you have a quality.
All  Yes. Absolutely. A quality.
Chandler  Oh, oh, a quality, good, because I was worried you guys were gonna be
vague about this.
Monica  Hello? Hello? Oh! Rachel, it's Paolo calling from Rome.
Rachel  Oh my God! Calling from Rome! (Takes phone) Bon giorno, caro mio.
Ross  (to Joey) So he's calling from Rome. I could do that. Just gotta go to
Rome.
Rachel  Monica, your dad just beeped in, but can you make it quick? Talking to
Rome. (Showing off to Phoebe and Chandler) I'm talking to Rome.
Monica  Hey dad, what's up? (Listens) Oh God. Ross, it's Nana.
[Scene  The Hospital, Mr. and Mrs. Geller are there, along with Aunt Lillian. Ross and
Monica enter and everyone says hi and kisses.)
Ross  So, uh, how's she doing?
Aunt Lillian  The doctor says it's a matter of hours.
Monica  How-how are you, Mom?
Mrs. Geller  Me? I'm fine, fine. I'm glad you're here. ...What's with your hair?
Monica  What?
Mrs. Geller  What's different?
Monica  Nothing.
Mrs. Geller  Oh, maybe that's it.
Monica  She is unbelievable, our mother is...
Ross  Okay, relax, relax. We are gonna be here for a while, it looks like, and
we still have boyfriends and your career to cover.
Monica  Oh God!
Monica  The fuzzy little mints at the bottom of her purse.
Ross  Oh! ...Yeah, they were gross. Oh, you know what I loved? Her Sweet 'n'
Los. How she was always stealing them from- from restaurants.
Mr. Geller  Not just restaurants, from our house.
Nurse  Mrs. Geller?
Ross  She looks so small.
Monica  I know.
Ross  Well, at least she's with Pop-Pop and Aunt Phyllis now.
Monica  G'bye, Nana. (She kisses her on the forehead.)
Ross  Bye, Nana.
Monica  Ross!
Mrs. Geller  What is going on?!
Ross  Y'know how-how the nurse said that-that Nana had passed? Well, she's not,
quite..
Mrs. Geller  What?
Ross  She's not- past, she's present, she's back.
Aunt Lillian  (reentering) What's going on?
Mr. Geller  She may have died.
Aunt Lillian  She may have died?
Mr. Geller  We're looking into it.
Ross  I, uh, I'll go see. (He goes in)
Nurse  This almost never happens!
Ross  Now she's passed.
[Scene  Central Perk, Chandler, Phoebe, Joey, and Rachel are there.]
Chandler  I just have to know, okay. Is it my hair?
Rachel  (exasperated) Yes, Chandler, that's exactly what it is. It's your hair.
Phoebe  Yeah, you have homosexual hair.
Rachel  So, um, did she...
Ross  Twice.
Joey  Twice?
Phoebe  Oh, that sucks!
Joey  You guys okay?
Ross  I dunno, it's weird. I mean, I know she's gone, but I just don't feel,
uh...
Phoebe  Maybe that's 'cause she's not really gone.
Ross  Nono, she's gone.
Monica  We checked. A lot.
Phoebe  Hm, I mean maybe no-one ever really goes. Ever since my mom died, every
now and then, I get the feeling that she's like right here, y'know? (She circles her hand
around her right shoulder. Chandler, sitting on her right, draws back nervously) Oh! And
Debbie, my best friend from junior high- got struck by lightning on a miniature golf
course- I always get this really strong Debbie vibe whenever I use one of those little
yellow pencils, y'know? ...I miss her.
Rachel  Aw. Hey, Pheebs, want this? (Gives her a pencil)
Phoebe  Thanks!
Rachel  Sure. I just sharpened her this morning.
Joey  Now, see, I don't believe any of that. I think once you're dead, you're
dead! You're gone! You're worm food! (realises his tactlessness) ...So Chandler looks gay,
huh?
Phoebe  Y'know, I dunno who this is, but it's not Debbie. (Hands back the
pencil)
[Scene  Nana's house, Ross, Mrs. Geller and Aunt Lillian are going through clothes.]
Ross  I thought it was gonna be a closed casket.
Mrs. Geller  Well, that doesn't mean she can't look nice!
Mrs. Geller  Sweetie, you think you can get in there?
Ross  (sarcastic) I don't see why not.
Ross  Here's my retainer!
[Scene  Monica and Rachel's, Monica is talking to her father.]
Mr. Geller  I was just thinking. When my time comes-
Monica  Dad!
Mr. Geller  Listen to me! When my time comes, I wanna be buried at sea.
Monica  You what?
Mr. Geller  I wanna be buried at sea, it looks like fun.
Monica  Define fun.
Mr. Geller  C'mon, you'll make a day of it! You'll rent a boat, pack a lunch...
Monica  ...And then we throw your body in the water... Gee, that does sound fun.
Mr. Geller  Everyone thinks they know me. Everyone says 'Jack Geller, so
predictable'. Maybe after I'm gone, they'll say 'Buried at sea! Huh!'.
Monica  That's probably what they'll say.
Mr. Geller  I'd like that.
[Scene  Chandler's Office, Shelley is drinking coffee; Chandler enters.]
Chandler  Hey, gorgeous.
Shelley  (sheepish) Hey. Look, I'm sorry about yesterday, I, um-
Chandler  No, nono, don't- don't worry about it. Believe me, apparently other
people have made the same mistake.
Shelley  Oh! Okay! Phew!
Chandler  So, uh... what do you think it is about me?
Shelley  I dunno, uh... you just have a-a...
Chandler  ...Quality, right, great.
Shelley  Y'know, it's a shame, because you and Lowell would've made a great
couple.
Chandler  Lowell? Financial Services' Lowell, that's who you saw me with?
Shelley  What? He's cute!
Chandler  Well, yeah... 's'no Brian in Payroll.
Shelley  Is Brian...?
Chandler  No! Uh, I d'know! The point is, if you were gonna set me up with
someone, I'd like to think you'd set me up with someone like him.
Shelley  Well, I think Brian's a little out of your league.
Chandler  Excuse me? You don't think I could get a Brian? Because I could get
a Brian. Believe you me. ...I'm really not.
[Scene  Nana's Bedroom, Ross is holding a dress out from inside the closet.]
Ross  (holding a dress out from inside the closet) This one?
Aunt Lillian  No.
Ross  I have shown you everything we have. Unless you want your mother to spend
eternity in a lemon yellow pant-suit, go with the burgundy.
Aunt Lillian  You know, whatever we pick, she would've told us it's the wrong
one.
Mrs. Geller  You're right. We'll go with the burgundy.
Ross  Oh! A fine choice. I'm coming out. (Starts to climb over the furniture)
Aunt Lillian  Wait! We need shoes!
Ross  Okay. Um, how about these? (Holds out a pair)
Mrs. Geller  That's really a day shoe.
Ross  And where she's going everyone else'll be dressier?
Aunt Lillian  Could we see something in a slimmer heel?
Ross  (forages around) Okay, I have nothing in an evening shoe in the burgundy.
I can show you something in a silver that may work.
Aunt Lillian  No, it really should be burgundy.
Mrs. Geller  Mm. Unless we go with a different dress?
Ross  No! Nonono, wait a sec. I may have something in the back.
Ross  Oh my God..
Mrs. Geller  Is everything all right, dear?
Ross  Yeah, just... just Nana stuff.
[Scene  Monica and Rachel's, Monica and Rachel are preparing to leave for the funeral.]
Ross  (entering) How we doing, you guys ready?
Monica  Mom already called this morning to remind me not to wear my hair up. Did
you know my ears are not my best feature?
Ross  Some days it's all I can think about.
Phoebe  (entering) Hi, sorry I'm late, I couldn't find my bearings.
Rachel  Oh, you-you mean your earrings?
Phoebe  What'd I say?
Rachel  (sticking her foot out) Hm-m.
Monica  Are these the shoes?
Rachel  Yes. Paolo sent them from Italy.
Ross  What, we-uh- we don't have shoes here, or...?
Joey  (entering with Chandler) Morning. We ready to go?
Chandler  Well, don't we look nice all dressed up?...It's stuff like that, isn't
it?
[Scene  The cemetary, after the funeral.]
Monica  It was a really beautiful service.
Mrs. Geller  It really was. Oh, c'mere, sweetheart. (Hugs her) Y'know, I think
it might be time for you to start using night cream.
Joey  What?
Chandler  Nothing, just your overcoat sounds remarkably like Brent Mussberger.
Joey  Check it out, Giants-Cowboys. (He has a pocket TV)
Chandler  You're watching a football game at a funeral?
Joey  No, it's the pre-game. I'm gonna watch it at the reception.
Chandler  You are a frightening, frightening man.
Rachel  Oh no! My new Paolo shoes!
Ross  Oh, I hope they're not ruined.
Phoebe  God, what a great day. ...What? Weather-wise!
Ross  I know, uh, the air, the-the trees... even though Nana's gone there's,
there's something almost, uh- I dunno, almost life-aff- (Not looking where he is going he
falls into an open grave)
All  God! Ross!
Ross  I'm fine. Just-just... having my worst fear realised...
[Scene  The Wake, at the Gellers' house. Ross is lying on his back, with Phoebe
squatting over him, checking to see if he's injured.]
Phoebe  Okay, don't worry, I'm just checking to see if the muscle's in
spasm...huh.
Ross  What, what is it?
Phoebe  You missed a belt loop.
Ross  Oh! No-n-
Phoebe  Okay, it's in spasm.
Mrs. Geller  Here, sweetie, here. I took these when I had my golfing accident.
(Hands Ross a bottle of pills. Then turns to Monica and pats her hair over her ears)
Chandler  Oh, no-
Andrea  Sorry- Hi, I'm Dorothy's daughter.
Chandler  Hi, I'm Chandler, and I have no idea who Dorothy is.
Phoebe  Hey, look who's up! How do you feel?
Ross  I feel great. I feel- great, I fleel great.
Monica  Wow, those pills really worked, huh?
Ross  Not the first two, but the second two- woooo! ...I love you guys. You guys
are the greatest. I love my sister (Kisses Monica), I love Pheebs... (Hugs her)
Phoebe  Ooh! That's so nice...
Ross  ...Chandler!
Chandler  Hey.
Ross  (hugs him) And listen, man, if you wanna be gay, be gay. Doesn't matter to
me.
Andrea  (turns to a friend) You were right. (They walk off and leave Chandler.)
Ross  Rachel. Rachel Rachel. (Sits down beside her) I love you the most.
Rachel  (humouring him) Oh, well you know who I love the most?
Ross  No.
Rachel  You!
Ross  Oh.. you don't get it! (Passes out and slumps across her)
Mr. Geller  Whaddya got there?
Joey  (hides the TV, but he still has an earphone) Just a, uh... hearing
disability.
Mr. Geller  What's the score?
Joey  Seventeen-fourteen Giants... three minutes to go in the third.
Mr. Geller  Beautiful! (Turns to watch with him)
Rachel  (still trapped under Ross) Pheebs, could you maybe hand me a cracker?
Mrs. Geller  (to Monica) Your grandmother would have hated this.
Monica  Well, sure, what with it being her funeral and all.
Mrs. Geller  No, I'd be hearing about 'Why didn't I get the honey-glazed ham?',
I didn't spend enough on flowers, and if I spent more she'd be saying 'Why are you wasting
your money? I don't need flowers, I'm dead'.
Monica  That sounds like Nana.
Mrs. Geller  Do you know what it's like to grow up with someone who is critical
of every single thing you say?
Monica  ...I can imagine.
Mrs. Geller  I'm telling you, it's a wonder your mother turned out to be the
positive, life-affirming person that she is.
Monica  That is a wonder. So tell me something, Mom. If you had to do it all
over again, I mean, if she was here right now, would you tell her?
Mrs. Geller  Tell her what?
Monica  How she drove you crazy, picking on every little detail, like your
hair... for example.
Mrs. Geller  I'm not sure I know what you're getting at.
Monica  Do you think things would have been better if you'd just told her the
truth?
Mrs. Geller  ...No. I think some things are better left unsaid. I think it's
nicer when people just get along.
Monica  Huh.
Mrs. Geller  More wine, dear?
Monica  Oh, I think so.
Mrs. Geller  (reaches out to fiddle with Monica's hair again, and realises)
Those earrings look really lovely on you.
Monica  Thank you. They're yours.
Mrs. Geller  Actually they were Nana's.
Mr. Geller  Now I'm depressed! ...(To everyone) Even more than I was.
[Scene  Central Perk, the gang are looking at old photos.]
Rachel  Hey, who's this little naked guy?
Ross  That little naked guy would be me.
Rachel  Aww, look at the little thing.
Ross  Yes, yes, fine, that is my penis. Can we be grown-ups now?
Chandler  Who are those people?
Ross  Got me.
Monica  Oh, that's Nana, right there in the middle. (Reads the back) 'Me and the
gang at Java Joe's'.
Rachel  Wow, Monica, you look just like your grandmother. How old was she there?
Monica  Let's see, 1939... yeah, 24, 25?
Ross  Looks like a fun gang. (They all look at each other and smile)
Joey  Ooh, look-look-look-look-look! I got Monica naked!
Ross  (looking) Nono, that would be me again. I'm, uh, just trying something.
[Scene  Chandler's Office, Chandler is on a coffee break as Lowell enters.]
Chandler  Hey, Lowell.
Lowell  Hey, Chandler.
Chandler  So how's it going there in Financial Services?
Lowell  It's like Mardi Gras without the paper mache heads. How 'bout you?
Chandler  Good, good. Listen, heh, I dunno what Shelley told you about me, but,
uh... I'm not.
Lowell  I know. That's what I told her.
Chandler  Really.
Lowell  Yeah.
Chandler  So- you can tell?
Lowell  Pretty much, most of the time. We have a kind of... radar.
Chandler  So you don't think I have a, a quality?
Lowell  Speaking for my people, I'd have to say no. By the way, your friend
Brian from Payroll, he is.
Chandler  He is?
Lowell  Yup, and waaay out of your league. (Exits)
Chandler  Out of my league. I could get a Brian. (Brian enters behind him) If I
wanted to get a Brian, I could get a Brian. (Sees him) Hey, Brian.
[Scene  Central Perk, Rachel is confronting her boss, Terry.]
Rachel  Terry, I, I, I know that I haven't worked here very long, but I was
wondering, do you think it would be possible if I got a $100 advance in my salary?
Terry  An advance?
Rachel  It's so that I can spend Thanksgiving with my family. See, every year we
go skiing in Vail, and normally my father pays for my ticket, but I sort of started the
whole independence thing, you know, which is actually why I took this job.
Terry  Rachel, Rachel, sweetheart. You're a terrible, terrible waitress. Really,
really awful.
Rachel  Ok, I, I hear what you're sayin'. I'm with you. Um, but I, but I'm
trying really hard. And I think I'm doing better. I really do. Does anybody need coffee?
(everyone in the place raises their hand) Oh, look at that.
[Scene  Central Perk, Rachel is approaching a customer.]
Rachel  Excuse me, sir. Hi, you come in here all time. I was just wondering, do
you think there's a possibility that you could give me an advance on my tips?
Guy  Huh?
Rachel  Ok, ok, that's fine. Fine. Hey, I'm sorry about that spill before.
(picks up the tip he leaves) Only $98.50 to go.
Monica  Hey. Ross, did you know Mom and Dad are going to Puerto Rico for
Thanksgiving?
Ross  No, they're not.
Monica  Yes, they are. The Blymens invited them.
Ross  You're wrong.
Monica  I am not wrong.
Ross  You're wrong.
Monica  No, I just talked to them.
Ross  (getting up, upset) I'm calling Mom.
Joey  Hey, hey.
Chandler  Hey.
Phoebe  Hey.
Chandler  And this from the cry-for-help department. Are you wearing makeup?
Joey  Yes, I am. As of today, I am officially Joey Tribbiani, actor slash model.
Chandler  That's so funny, 'cause I was thinking you look more like Joey
Tribbiani, man slash woman.
Phoebe  What were you modeling for?
Joey  You know those posters for the city free clinic?
Monica  Oh, wow, so you're gonna be one of those "healthy, healthy, healthy
guys"?
Phoebe  You know, the asthma guy was really cute.
Chandler  Do you know which one you're gonna be?
Joey  No, but I hear lyme disease is open, so... (crosses fingers)
Chandler  Good luck, man. I hope you get it.
Joey  Thanks.
Ross  (to Monica) Well, you were right. How can they do this to us, huh? It's
Thanksgiving.
Monica  Ok, I'll tell you what. How about I cook dinner at my place? I'll make
it just like Mom's.
Ross  Will you make the mashed potatoes with the lumps?
Monica  You know, they're not actually supposed to have... (Ross looks at her
sheepishly) I'll work on the lumps. Joey, you're going home, right?
Joey  Yeah.
Monica  And I assume, Chandler, you are still boycotting all the pilgrim
holidays.
Chandler  Yes, every single one of them.
Monica  Phoebe, you're gonna be with your grandma?
Phoebe  Yes, and her boyfriend. But we're celebrating Thanksgiving in December
'cause he is lunar.
Monica  So you're free Thursday, then.
Phoebe  Yeah. Oh, can I come?
Monica  Yeah. Rach, are you thinking you're gonna make it to Vail?
Rachel  Absolutely. Shoop, shoop, shoop. Only a hundred and two dollars to go.
Chandler  I thought it was $98.50.
Rachel  Yeah, well it was. I, I broke a cup.
Ross  Well, I'm off to Carol's.
Phoebe  Ooh, ooh! Why don't we invite her?
Ross  (mimicking) Ooh, ooh. Because she's my ex-wife, and will probably want to
bring her, ooh, ooh, lesbian life partner.
[Scene  Carol and Susan's apartment, Susan is there. Ross enters.]
Ross  Hi, is uh, is Carol here?
Susan  No, she's at a faculty meeting.
Ross  Thanks. Yeah, Carol borrowed it for a class, and I have to get it back to
the museum.
Susan  What's it look like?
Ross  Kinda like a big face without skin.
Susan  Yes, I'm familiar with the concept. We can just look for it.
Ross  Ok. (browsing the apartment) Wow, you guys sure have a lot of books about
bein' a lesbian.
Susan  Well, you know, you have to take a course. Otherwise, they don't let you
do it.
Ross  (picking up a book) Hey, hey, Yertle the Turtle. A classic.
Susan  Actually, I'm reading it to the baby.
Ross  The uh, the baby that hasn't been born yet? Wouldn't that mean you're...
crazy?
Susan  What, you don't think they can hear sounds in there?
Ross  You're not serious, I mean, you really... you really talk to it?
Susan  Yeah, all the time. I want the baby to know my voice.
Ross  Do you uh, do you talk about me?
Susan  Yeah, yeah, all the time.
Ross  Really?
Susan  But um, we just refer to you as Bobo the Sperm Guy.
[Scene  Monica and Rachel's, everyone is there but Rachel.]
Ross  Look, if she's talking to it, I just think that I should get some belly
time too. Not that I believe any of this.
Phoebe  Oh, I believe it. I think the baby can totally hear everything. I can
show you. Look, this will seem a little weird, but you put your head inside this turkey,
and then we'll all talk, and you'll hear everything we say.
Chandler  I'd just like to say that I'm totally behind this experiment. In fact,
I'd very much like to butter your head.
Monica  Hey, Rach, did you make your money?
Rachel  No, not even close. Forget Vail, forget seeing my family, forget shoop,
shoop, shoop.
Monica  Rach, here's your mail.
Rachel  Thanks, you can just put it on the table.
Monica  (insistently) No, here's your mail.
Rachel  Thanks, you can just put it on the table.
Monica  (gives her an envelope) Would you just open it?
Rachel  Oh my god, oh, you guys are great.
Monica  We all chipped in.
Joey  (to Monica) We did?
Monica  (to Joey) You owe me 20 bucks.
Rachel  Thank you. Thank you so much!
Monica  (hands Chandler a bag) Chandler, here you go, got your traditional
Thanksgiving feast, you got your tomato soup, your grilled cheese fixin's, and your family
size bag of Funyuns.
Rachel  Wait, wait, Chandler, this is what you're havin' for Thanksgiving
dinner? What, what, what is it with you and this holiday?
Chandler  All right, I'm nine years old.
Ross  Oh, I hate this story.
Chandler  We just finished this magnificent Thanksgiving dinner. I have--and I
remember this part vividly--a mouthful of pumpkin pie, and this is the moment my parents
choose to tell me they're getting divorced.
Rachel  Oh my god.
Chandler  Yes. It's very difficult to appreciate a Thanksgiving dinner once
you've seen it in reverse.
[Scene  The subway, Joey spots a gorgeous woman waiting. He goes up to her.]
Joey  Uh, hi. We uh, we used to work together.
Girl  We did?
Joey  Yeah, at Macy's. You were the Obsession girl, right? I was the Aramis guy.
(pretends to spray cologne) Aramis? Aramis?
Girl  Yeah, right.
Joey  I gotta tell you. You're the best in the business.
Girl  Get out.
Joey  I'm serious. You're amazing. You know when to spritz, when to lay back.
Girl  Really? You don't know what that means to me.
Joey  Ooh, you smell great tonight. What're you wearing?
Girl  (provocatively) Nothing.
Joey  Listen, uh, you wanna go get a drink or something?
Girl  Yeah. (she gets up, notices something behind Joey) Oh.
Joey  What's wrong?
Girl  I just remembered, I have to do something.
Joey  Oh. What?
Girl  Um, leave.
Joey  Wait, wait, wait!
(Joey turns around and sees his face on a poster in the subway. The poster says  What
Mario isn't telling you...V.D., you never know who might have it. A variety of scenes are
shown with the poster displayed all over New York City.)
[Scene  Central Perk, Joey enters, amongst snickers from the gang.]
Joey  So I guess you all saw it.
Rachel  Saw what?
Phoebe  No, we were just laughing. You know, how laughter can be infectious.
[Scene  Monica and Rachel's, Joey enters, upset.]
Joey  Set another place for Thanksgiving. My entire family thinks I have VD.
Chandler  Tonight, on a very special Blossom.
[Scene  Monica and Rachel's, Monica is cooking Thanksgiving dinner. Chandler is
standing in the doorway, not wanting to participate in the festivities.]
Monica  Mmm, looking good. Ok, cider's mulling, turkey's turking, yams are
yamming. (notices Ross is depressed) What?
Ross  I don't know. It's just not the same without Mom in the kitchen.
Monica  All right, that's it. You know what? Just get out of my way and stop
moping.
Ross  That's closer.
Rachel  I got the tickets! I got the tickets! Five hours from now, shoop, shoop,
shoop.
Chandler  Oh, you must stop shooping.
Rachel  Ok, I'm gonna get my stuff.
Joey  Chandler, will you just come in already?
Chandler  No, I prefer to keep a safe distance from all this merriment.
Phoebe  Look out, incoming pumpkin pie!
Chandler  Ok, we all laughed when you did it with the stuffing, but that's not
funny anymore.
Joey  Hey, Monica, I got a question. I don't see any tater tots.
Monica  That's not a question.
Joey  But my mom always makes them. It's like a tradition. You get a little
piece of turkey on your fork, a little cranberry sauce, and a tot! It's bad enough I can't
be with my family because of my disease.
Monica  All right, fine. Tonight's potatoes will be both mashed with lumps, and
in the form of tots.
Ross  Ok, I'm off to talk to my unborn child.
Monica  Ah!
Ross  Ok, Mom never hit.
Phoebe  (stirring pot) Ok, all done.
Monica  What, Phoebe, did you whip the potatoes? Ross needs lumps!
Phoebe  Oh, I'm sorry, oh, I just, I thought we could have them whipped and then
add some peas and onions.
Monica  Why would we do that?
Phoebe  Well, 'cause then they'd be like my mom used to make them, you know,
before she died.
Monica  Ok, three kinds of potatoes coming up.
Rachel  Ok, good-bye you guys. Thanks for everything. (she starts to leave, and
hits everyone with her skis) Oh, sorry! Oh, sorry!
Chandler  The most unbelievable thing has happened. Underdog has just gotten
away.
Joey  The balloon?
Chandler  No, no, the actual cartoon character. Of course the balloon. It's all
over the news. Right before he reached Macy's, he broke free and was spotted
flying over Washington Square Park. I'm goin' to the roof, who's with me?
Rachel  I can't, I gotta go.
Chandler  Come on. An 80-foot inflatable dog let loose over the city. How often
does that happen?
Phoebe  Almost never.
Monica  Got the keys? or Got the keys!
Rachel  Ok.
[Scene  Carol and Susan's, Ross is preparing to talk to her belly.]
Carol  Anytime you're ready.
Ross  Ok, ok, here we go. (he crouches down near her stomach) Ok, where am I
talking to, here? I mean, uh, well, there is one way that seems to offer a certain
acoustical advantage, but...
Carol  Just aim for the bump.
Ross  Ok, ok, ok, ok, here goes. You know, I, you know, can't do this. Uh, this
is too weird. I feel stupid.
Carol  So don't do it, it's fine. You don't have to do it just because Susan
does it.
Ross  (quickly talking) Hello, baby. Hello, hello.
[Scene  Monica and Rachel's, the group is coming back from the roof.]
Rachel  I loved the moment when you first saw the giant dog shadow all over the
park.
Phoebe  Yeah, but did they have to shoot him down? I mean, that was just mean.
Monica  Ok, right about now the turkey should be crispy on the outside, juicy on
the inside. Why are we standing here?
Rachel  We're waiting for you to open the door. You got the keys.
Monica  No I don't.
Rachel  Yes, you do. When we left, you said, "got the keys."
Monica  No I didn't. I asked, "got the ke-eys?"
Rachel  No, no, no, you said, "got the keys".
Chandler  Do either of you have the keys?
Monica  (panicked) The oven is on.
Rachel  Oh, I gotta get my ticket!
Joey  Wait, wait, we have a copy of your key.
Monica  Well then get it, get it!
Joey  That tone will not make me go any faster.
Monica  (angry) Joey!
Joey  That one will.
[Scene  Carol and Susan's, Carol is reading, Ross is talking to her stomach.]
Ross  And everyone's telling me, you gotta pick a major, you gotta pick a major.
So, on a dare, I picked paleontology. And you have no idea what I'm saying, because, let's
face it, you're a fetus. You're just happy you don't have gills anymore.
Carol  Look, you don't have to talk to it. You can sing to it if you want.
Ross  Oh, please. I am not singing to your stomach, ok?
Susan  Hi, how's it goin?
Ross  Shh! (singing) Here we come, walkin' down the street, get the funniest
looks from, everyone we meet. Hey, hey! (to Carol) Hey, uh, did you just feel that?
Carol  I did.
Ross  Does it always, uh--?
Carol  No, no that was the first.
Susan  Keep singing! Keep singing!
Ross  (singing) Hey, hey, you're my baby, and I can't wait to meet you. When
you come out I'll buy you a bagel, and then we'll go to the zoo.
Susan  I felt it!
Ross  (singin) Hey, hey, I'm your daddy. I'm the one without any breasts.
[Scene  The Hallway, Joey has a tray full of keys, and is trying each one in the lock.]
Joey  Nope, not that one.
Monica  Can you go any faster with that?
Joey  Hey, I got one keyhole and about a zillion keys. You do the math.
Monica  Why do you guys have so many keys in there anyway?
Chandler  (sarcastic) For an emergency just like this.
Rachel  (grabs Chandler by the shirt) All right, listen, smirky. If it wasn't
for you and your stupid balloon, I would be on a plane watching a woman do this (makes a
gesture like a stewardess pointing out exits) right now. But I'm not.
Monica  I swear you said you had the keys.
Rachel  No, I didn't. I wouldn't say I had the keys unless I had the keys, and I
obviously didn't have the keys.
Phoebe  Ooh, ok, that's it. Enough with the keys. No one say keys.
Monica  Why would I have the keys?
Rachel  Aside from the fact that you said you had them?
Monica  But I didn't.
Rachel  Well, you should have.
Monica  Why?
Rachel  Because!
Monica  Why?
Rachel  Because!
Monica  Why? Because everything is my responsibility? Isn't it enough that I'm
making Thanksgiving dinner for everyone? You know, everyone wants a different kind of
potatoes, so I'm making different kinds of potatoes. Does anybody care what kind of
potatoes I want? Nooooo, no, no! (starting to cry) Just as long as Phoebe gets her peas
and onions, and Mario gets his tots, and it's my first Thanksgiving, and it's all burned,
and, and I... I...
Chandler  Ok, Monica, only dogs can hear you now, so, look, the door's open.
Here we go.
Monica  Well, the turkey's burnt. (checking pots) Potatoes are ruined, potatoes
are ruined, potatoes are ruined.
Ross  Here we come, walkin' down thethis doesn't smell like Mom's.
Monica  No, it doesn't, does it? But you wanted lumps, Ross? (picks up the pan
of badly burnt potatoes) Well, here you go, buddy, ya got one.
Rachel  Oh, god, this is great! The plane is gone, so it looks like I'm stuck
here with you guys.
Joey  Hey, we all had better plans. This was nobody's first choice.
Monica  Oh, really? So why was I busting my ass to make this delicious
Thanksgiving dinner?
Joey  You call that delicious?
Monica  Stop it, stop it, stop it!
Chandler  Now this feels like Thanksgiving.
Phoebe  Ooh.
Rachel  What?
Phoebe  Ugly Naked Guy's taking his turkey out of the oven. Oh my god. He's not
alone. Ugly Naked Guy's having Thanksgiving dinner with Ugly Naked Gal.
Joey  I've gotta see this. All right Ugly Naked Guy!
Monica  Ooh, Ugly Naked Dancing!
Phoebe  It's nice that he has someone.
Chandler  Shall I carve?
Rachel  By all means.
Chandler  Ok, who wants light cheese, and who wants dark cheese?
Ross  I don't even wanna know about the dark cheese.
Monica  (holding sandwich) Does anybody wanna split this with me?
Joey  Oh, I will.
Phoebe  Ooh, you guys have to make a wish.
Monica  Make a wish?
Phoebe  Come on, you know, Thanksgiving. Ooh, you got the bigger half. What'd
you wish for?
Joey  The bigger half.
Chandler  I'd like to propose a toast. Little toast here, ding ding. I know this
isn't the kind of Thanksgiving that all of you all planned, but for me, this has been
really great, you know, I think because it didn't involve divorce or projectile vomiting.
Anyway, I was just thinking, I mean, if you'd gone to Vail, and if you guys'd been with
your family, if you didn't have syphilis and stuff, we wouldn't be all together, you know?
So I guess what I'm trying to say is that I'm very thankful that all of your Thanksgivings
sucked.
All  That's so sweet.
Ross  And hey, here's to a lousy Christmas.
Rachel  And a crappy New Year.
Chandler  Here, here!
[Scene  Monica and Rachel's, Ross is entering.]
Ross  Guys? There's a somebody I'd like you to meet.
All  Oooh!
Monica  W-wait. What is that?
Ross  'That' would be Marcel. You wanna say hi?
Monica  No, no, I don't.
Rachel  Oh, he is precious! Where did you get him?
Ross  My friend Bethel rescued him from some lab.
Phoebe  That is so cruel! Why? Why would a parent name their child Bethel?
Chandler  Hey, that monkey's got a Ross on its ass!
Monica  Ross, is he gonna live with you, like, in your apartment?
Ross  Yeah. I mean, it's been kinda quiet since Carol left, so...
Monica  Why don't you just get a roommate?
Ross  Nah, I dunno... I think you reach a certain age, having a roommate is
kinda pathe- (Realises) ....sorry, that's, that's 'pathet', which is Sanskrit for 'really
cool way to live'.
[Scene  Central Perk, Phoebe is getting ready to sing. Joey is not there.]
Phoebe  So you guys, I'm doing all new material tonight. I have twelve new songs
about my mother's suicide, and one about a snowman.
Chandler  Might wanna open with the snowman.
All  Hey, Joey. Hey, buddy.
Monica  So, how'd it go?
Joey  Ahhhhhh, I didn't get the job.
Ross  How could you not get it? You were Santa last year.
Joey  I dunno. Some fat guy's sleeping with the store manager. He's not even
jolly, it's all political.
Monica  So what are you gonna be?
Joey  Ah, I'm gonna be one of his helpers. It's just such a slap in the face,
y'know?
Rachel  Hey, do you guys know what you're doing for New Year's? (They all
protest and hit her with cushions) Gee, what?! What is wrong with New Year's?
Rachel  Well, for your information, Paolo is gonna be in Rome this New Year, so
I'll be just as pathetic as the rest of you.
Phoebe  Yeah, you wish!
Chandler  It's just that I'm sick of being a victim of this Dick Clark holiday.
I say this year, no dates, we make a pact. Just the six of us- dinner.
All  Yeah, okay. Alright.
Chandler  Y'know, I was hoping for a little more enthusiasm.
All  Woooo! Yeah!
Rachel  Phoebe, you're on.
Phoebe  Oh, oh, good.
Rachel  (Into microphone) Okay, hi. Ladies and gentlemen, back by popular
demand, Miss Phoebe Buffay. Wooh!
Phoebe  (Sung)
Phoebe  (Sung)
Max  No. No, that's- that's okay.
Phoebe  Well, c'mon, if it's important enough to discuss while I'm playing, then
I assume it's important enough for everyone else to hear!
Chandler  (Quietly, to the others) That guy's going home with a note!
David  Noth- I was- I was just saying to my-
Phoebe  Could you speak up please?
David  (Stands up and speaks more loudly) Sorry, I wa- I was just saying to my
friend that I thought you were the most beautiful woman that I'd ever seen in my- in my
life. And then he said that- you said you thought
Max  Daryl Hannah.
David  Daryl Hannah was the most beautiful woman that he'd ever seen in his life
and I said yeah, I liked her in Splash, a lot, but not so much in- in Wall Street, I
thought she had kind of a
Max  Hard quality.
David  -hard quality. And uh, while Daryl Hannah is beautiful in a conventional
way, you are luminous with a kind of a delicate grace. Then, uh, that-that-that's when you
started yelling. (Sits down)
Phoebe  Okay, we're gonna take a short break. (Goes over to their table)
Joey  Hey, that guy's going home with more than a note!
[Scene  Monica and Rachel's, everyone except Joey is decorating for Christmas.]
Ross  Come here, Marcel. Sit here. (Marcel wanders off)
Rachel  Pheebs, I can't believe he hasn't kissed you yet. I mean God, by my
sixth date with Paolo, I mean he had already named both my breasts! ...Ooh. Did I just
share too much?
Ross  Just a smidge.
Phoebe  David's like, y'know, Scientist Guy. He's very methodical.
Monica  I think it's romantic.
Phoebe  Me too! Oh! Did you ever see An Officer and a Gentleman?
Rachel  Yeah!
Phoebe  Well, he's kinda like the guy I went to see that with. Except, except
he-he's smarter, and gentler, and sweeter... I just- I just wanna be with him all the
time. Day and night, and night and day... and special occasions...
Chandler  Wait a minute, wait a minute, I see where this is going, you're gonna
ask him to New Year's, aren't you. You're gonna break the pact. She's gonna break the
pact.
Phoebe  No, no, no, no, no, no. Yeah, could I just?
Chandler  Yeah, 'cause I already asked Janice.
Monica  What?!
Ross  C'mon, this was a pact! This was your pact!
Chandler  I snapped, okay? I couldn't handle the pressure and I snapped.
Monica  Yeah, but Janice? That-that was like the worst breakup in history!
Chandler  I'm not saying it was a good idea, I'm saying I snapped!
Joey  Hi. Hi, sorry I'm late.
Chandler  Too many jokes... must mock Joey!
Joey  Nice shoes, huh? (He wiggles his foot and the bells tinkle)
Chandler  Aah, y'killing me!
Monica  Ross! He's playing with my spatulas again!
Ross  Okay, look, he's not gonna hurt them, right?
Monica  Do you always have to bring him here?
Ross  I didn't wanna leave him alone. Alright? We- we had our first fight this
morning. I think it has to do with my working late. I said some things that I didn't mean,
and he- he threw some faeces...
Chandler  Y'know, if you're gonna work late, I could look in on him for you.
Ross  Oh, that'd be great! Okay, but if you do, make sure it seems like you're
there to see him, okay, and you're not like doing it as a favour to me.
Chandler  Okay, but if he asks, I'm not going to lie.
[Scene  Max and David's lab, David is explaining something to Phoebe with the aid of a
whiteboard.]
David  ...But, you can't actually test this theory, because today's particle
accelerators are nowhere near powerful enough to simulate these conditions.
Phoebe  Okay, alright, I have a question, then.
David  Yuh.
Phoebe  Um, were you planning on kissing me ever?
David  Uh, that's definitely a, uh, valid question. And, uh, the answer would be
(Writes YES on the board) yes. Yes I was. But, see, I wanted it to be this phenomenal kiss
that happened at this phenomenal moment, because, well, 'cause it's you.
Phoebe  Sure.
David  Right. But, see, the longer I waited, the more phenomenal the kiss had to
be, and now we've reached a place where it's just gotta be one of those things where I
just like... sweep everything off the table and throw you down on it. And, uh, I'm not
really a, uh, sweeping sorta fella.
Phoebe  Oh, David, I, I think you are a sweeping sorta fella. I mean, you're a
sweeper! ...trapped inside a physicist's body.
David  Rrrreally.
Phoebe  Oh, yeah, oh, I'm sure of it. You should just do it, just sweep and
throw me.
David  ...Now? Now?
Phoebe  Oh yeah, right now.
David  Okay, okay, okay. (Gets ready to sweep, and then picks up a laptop
computer) Y'know what, this was just really expensive. (Puts it down elsewhere. Then picks
up a microscope) And I'll take- this was a gift. (Moves it)
Phoebe  Okay, now you're just kinda tidying.
David  Okay, what the hell, what the hell. (Sweeps the remaining papers off the
desk and grabs Phoebe) You want me to actually throw you or you-you wanna just hop?
Phoebe  I can hop. (She hops onto the table)
[Scene  Central Perk, everyone is there.]
Ross  So tell me something. What does the phrase 'no date pact' mean to you?
Monica  I'm sorry, okay. It's just that Chandler has somebody, and Phoebe has
somebody- I thought I'd ask Fun Bobby.
Chandler  Fun Bobby? Your ex-boyfriend Fun Bobby?
Monica  Yeah.
Joey  You know more than one Fun Bobby?
Chandler  I happen to know a Fun Bob.
Rachel  (Brings Joey a mug of coffee) Okay, here we go...
Joey  Ooh ooh ooh ooh, there's no room for milk!
Rachel  (Glances at Joey and then sips his coffee) There. Now there is.
Ross  Okay, so on our no-date evening, three of you now have dates.
Joey  Uh, four.
Ross  Four.
Rachel  Five.
Ross  Five. (Buries his head in his hands)
Rachel  Sorry. Paolo's catching an earlier flight.
Joey  Yeah, and I met this really hot single mom at the store. What's an elf to
do?
Ross  Okay, so I'm gonna be the only one standing there alone when the ball
drops?
Rachel  Oh, c'mon. We'll have, we'll have a big party, and no-one'll know who's
with who.
Ross  Hey, y'know, this is so not what I needed right now.
Monica  What's the matter?
Ross  Oh, it's-it's Marcel. He keeps shutting me out, y'know? He's walking
around all the time dragging his hands...
Chandler  That's so weird, I had such a blast with him the other night.
Ross  Really.
Chandler  Yeah, we played, we watched TV.. that juggling thing is amazing.
Ross  What, uh... what juggling thing?
Chandler  With the balled-up socks? I figured you taught him that.
Ross  No.
Chandler  Y'know, it wasn't that big a deal. He just balled up socks... and a
melon...
Max  Phoebe. Hi.
Phoebe  Oh, hi Max! Hey, do you know everybody?
Max  No. Have you seen David?
Phoebe  No, no, he hasn't been around.
Max  Well, if you see him, tell him to pack his bags. We are going to Minsk.
Phoebe  Minsk?
Max  Minsk. It's in Russia.
Phoebe  I know where Minsk is.
Max  We got the grant. Three years, all expenses paid.
Phoebe  So when, when do you leave?
Max  January first.
[Scene  Max and David's lab, they are working. Phoebe knocks on the door]
Phoebe  Hello?
David  Hey!
Phoebe  Hi.
David  Hi! (Kisses her) What-what're you doing here?
Phoebe  Um, well, Max told me about Minsk, so (Puts on a fake cheery voice)
congratulations! This is so exciting!
Max  It'd be even more exciting if we were going.
Phoebe  Oh, you're not going? (Fake disappointed voice) Oh, why?
Max  Tell her, David. 'I don't wanna go to Minsk and work with Lifson and
Yamaguchi and Flench, on nonononononono. I wanna stay here and make out with my
girlfriend!!' (Storms out)
David  Thank you, Max. Thank you.
Phoebe  So-so you're really not going?
David  I don't know. I don't know what I'm gonna do. I just- you decide.
Phoebe  Oh don't do that.
David  Please.
Phoebe  Oh no no.
David  No, but I'm asking-
Phoebe  Oh, but I can't do that-
David  No, but I can't-
Phoebe  It's your thing, and-
David  -make the decision-
Phoebe  Okay, um, stay.
David  Stay.
Phoebe  Stay.
Phoebe  Getting so good at that! (She hops on)
David  It was Max's stuff. (They kiss)
[Scene  Monica and Rachel's, the party has started.]
Janice  I love this artichoke thing! Oh, don't tell me what's in it, the diet
starts tomorrow! (Laughs her Janice laugh)
Chandler  You remember Janice.
Monica  Vividly.
Monica  Hi.
Sandy  Hi, I'm Sandy.
Joey  Sandy! Hi! C'mon in! (She enters, followed by a young boy and a younger
girl)...You brought your kids.
Sandy  Yeah. That's okay, right?
Ross  Par-tay!
Monica  That thing is not coming in here.
Ross  'That thing'? This is how you greet guests at a party? Let me ask you
something, if I showed up here with my new girlfriend, she wouldn't be welcome in your
home?
Monica  I'm guessing your new girlfriend wouldn't urinate on my coffee table.
Ross  Okay. He was more embarrassed about that than anyone. Okay? And for him to
have the courage to walk back in here like nothing happened...
Monica  Alright. Just keep him away from me.
Ross  Thank you. (She walks off) C'mon, Marcel, whaddya say you and I do a
little mingling? (Marcel runs off) Alright, I'll, uh... catch up with you later.
Monica  Oh my gosh! Rachel, honey.. are you okay? Where-where's Paolo?
Rachel  Rome. Jerk missed his flight.
Phoebe  And then... your face is bloated?
Rachel  No. Okay. I was at the airport, getting into a cab, when this woman-
this blonde planet with a pocketbook- starts yelling at me. Something about how it was her
cab first. And then the next thing I know she just starts- starts pulling me out by my
hair! So I'm blowing my attack whistle thingy and three more cabs show up, and as I'm
going to get into a cab she tackles me. And I hit my head on the kerb and cut my lip on my
whistle...oh...everybody having fun at the party? (To Monica) Are people eating my dip?
Sandy  Y'know, when I saw you at the store last week, it was probably the first
time I ever mentally undressed an elf.
Joey  Wow, that's, uh, dirty.
Sandy  Yeah.
Joey  Hey, kids...
Ross  (Watching Marcel play with Phoebe. To Chandler) Look at him. I'm not
saying he has to spend the whole evening with me, but at least check in.
Janice  (Startles them) There you are! Haaah, you got away from me!
Chandler  (Imitating) But you found me!
Janice  Here, Ross, take our picture. (Hands him a camera and he starts
snapping) Smile! You're on Janice Camera!
Chandler  Kill me. Kill me now.
Monica  Hey everybody! It's Fun Bobby!
Fun Bobby  Hey, sorry I'm late. But my, uh, grandfather, he- died about two
hours ago. But I-I-I couldn't get a flight out 'til tomorrow, so here I am!
Joey  (Approaching) Hey Fun Bobby! Whoah! Who died?
Fun Bobby  It's gonna be an open casket, y'know, so at least I'll- I get to see
him again.
Janice  (Ross is still taking their photo) Oh, I'm gonna blow this one up, and
I'm gonna write 'Reunited' in glitter.
Chandler  Alright, Janice, that's it! Janice... Janice... Hey, Janice, when I
invited you to this party I didn't necessarily think that it meant that we-
Janice  Oh, no. Oh, no.
Chandler  I'm sorry you misunderstood...
Janice  Oh my God. You listen to me, Chandler, you listen to me. One of these
times is just gonna be your last chance with me. (She runs off)
Chandler  Oh, will you give me the thing. (Snatches the camera)
Phoebe  Hi, Max!
Max  Yoko. (To David) I've decided to go to Minsk without you.
David  Wow.
Max  It won't be the same- but it'll still be Minsk. Happy New Year.(Walks off)
Phoebe  Are you alright?
David  Yeah, I'm fine, I'm fine.
Phoebe  You're going to Minsk.
David  No, I'm... not going to Minsk.
Phoebe  Oh, you are so going to Minsk. You belong in Minsk. You can't stay here
just 'cause of me.
David  Yes I can. Because if I go it means I have to break up with you, and I
can't break up with you.
Phoebe  Oh yes, yes, yes you can. Just say, um, 'Phoebe, my work is my life and
that's what I have to do right now'. And I say 'your work?! Your work?! How can you say
that?!'. And then you say, um, 'it's tearing me apart, but I have no choice. Can't you
understand that?'. And I say (Hits him) 'no! No! I can't understand that!'.
David  Uh, ow.
Phoebe  Ooh, sorry. Um, and, and then you put your arms around me. And then you
put your arms around me. (He does so) And, um, and then you tell me that you love me and
you'll never forget me.
David  I'll never forget you.
Phoebe  And then you say that it's almost midnight and you have to go because
you don't wanna start the new year with me if you can't finish it. (They kiss) I'm gonna
miss you. You scientist guy.
Dick Clark  (on TV) Hi, this is Dick Clark, live in Times Square. We're in a
virtual snowstorm of confetti here in Times Square...
Joey  There y'go, kids.
Chandler  (To a woman who he has clearly just met) And then the peacock bit me.
(Laughs) Please kiss me at midnight. (She leaves)
Joey  You seen Sandy?
Chandler  Ooh. Uh, I don't know how to tell you this, but she's in Monica's
bedroom, getting it on with Max, that scientist geek. Ooh, look at that, I did know how to
tell you.
Rachel  Vrrbddy, the bll is drrbing.
All  (in the kitchen) What?
Rachel  The bll is drrbing!
Dick Clark  (on TV) In twenty seconds it'll be midnight...
Chandler  And the moment of joy is upon us.
Joey  Looks like that no date pact thing worked out.
Phoebe  Everybody looks so happy. I hate that.
Monica  Not everybody's happy. Hey Bobby!
Chandler  Y'know, I uh.. just thought I'd throw this out here. I'm no math whiz,
but I do believe there are three girls and three guys right here. (Makes kiss noise)
Phoebe  I dunno. I don't feel like kissing anyone tonight.
Rachel  I can't kiss anyone.
Monica  So I'm kissing everyone?
Joey  Nonono, you can't kiss Ross, that's your brother.
Ross  Perfect. Perfect. So now everybody's getting kissed but me.
Chandler  Alright, somebody kiss me. Somebody kiss me, it's midnight! Somebody
kiss me!
Joey  Alrightalrightalright. (Kisses him. Ross takes a photo) There.
[Scene  Monica and Rachel's, time lapse.]
Ross  (Watching Marcel and talking to Rachel) I wanted this to work so much. I
mean I'm still in there, changing his diapers, pickin' his fleas... but he's just phoning
it in. Just so hard to accept the fact that something you love so much doesn't love you
back.
Rachel  ...I think that bitch cracked my tooth.
Phoebe  Do you think they have yesterday's daily news?
Monica  Why?
Phoebe  Just wanna check my horoscope, see if it was right.
Monica  Oh my God. (Grabs Phoebe and turns her away) Phoebe. Don't look now, but
behind us is a guy who has the potential to break our hearts and plunge us into a pit of
depression.
Phoebe  Where? (Turns to face him) Ooh, come to Momma.
Monica  He's coming. Be cool, be cool, be cool.
Guy  Nice hat.
Monica and Phoebe  (in unison) Thanks.
Phoebe  We should do something. Whistle.
Monica  We are not going to whistle.
Phoebe  Come on, do it.
Monica  No!
Phoebe  Do it!
Monica  No!
Phoebe  Do it do it do it!
Monica  (Shouts to the guy) Woo-woo!
Phoebe  I can't believe you did that!
[Scene  Hospital, the guy is in a coma and Mon and Pheebs are visiting.]
Monica  Why did I 'woo-hoo'? I mean, what was I hoping would happen? That-that
he'd turn round and say 'I love that sound, I must have you now'?
Phoebe  I just wish there was something we could do. (Bends down and talks to
him) Hello. Hello, Coma Guy. GET UP, YOU GIRL SCOUT! UP! UP! UP!
Monica  Phoebe, what are you doing?
Phoebe  Maybe nobody's tried this.
Monica  I wish we at least knew his name... Look at that face. I mean, even
sleeping, he looks smart. I bet he's a lawyer.
Phoebe  Yeah, but did you see the dents in his knuckles? That means he's
artistic.
Monica  Okay, he's a lawyer, who teaches sculpting on the side. And- he can
dance!
Phoebe  Oh! And, he's the kinda guy who, when you're talking, he's listening,
y'know, and not saying 'Yeah, I understand' but really wondering what you look like naked.
Monica  I wish all guys could be like him.
Phoebe  I know.
[Scene  Monica and Rachel's, Monica and Phoebe are telling everyone about their coma
guy.]
Chandler  Are there no conscious men in the city for you two?
Monica  He doesn't have anyone.
Phoebe  Yeah, we-we feel kinda responsible.
Joey  I can't believe you said woowoo. I don't even say woowoo.
Rachel  Oh, she's coming up! She's coming up! (Turns on the TV)
Chandler  Y'know, we don't have to watch this. Weekend At Bernie's is
on Showtime, HBO, and Cinemax.
Rachel  No way, forget it.
Joey  C'mon, she's your mom!
Chandler  Exactly. Weekend At Bernie's! Dead guy getting hit in the
groin twenty, thirty times! No?
Rachel  Chandler, I gotta tell you, I love your mom's books! I love her books! I
cannot get on a plane without one! I mean, this is so cool!
Chandler  Yeah, well, you wouldn't think it was cool if you're eleven years old
and all your friends are passing around page 79 of 'Mistress Bitch.'
Ross  C'mon, Chandler, I love your mom. I think she's a blast.
Chandler  You can say that because she's not your mom.
Ross  Oh, please...
Paolo  Bona sera.
Rachel  Oh, hi sweetie. (They kiss)
Ross  When did Rigatoni get back from Rome?
Monica  Last night.
Ross  Ah, so then his plane didn't explode in a big ball of fire?... Just a
dream I had- but, phew.
Phoebe  Hey hey hey! She's on!
Paolo  Ah! Nora Bing!
Jay Leno  (on TV) ...Now what is this about you-you being arrested i-in London?
What is that all about?
Phoebe  Your mom was arrested?
Chandler  Shhh, busy beaming with pride.
Mrs. Bing  (on TV) ...This is kind of embarrassing, but occasionally after I've
been intimate with a man...
Chandler  Now why would she say that's embarrassing?
All  Shhh.
Mrs. Bing  (on TV) ...I just get this craving for Kung Pow Chicken.
Chandler  THAT'S TOO MUCH INFORMATION!!
Jay Leno  (on TV) Alright, so now you're doing this whole book tour thing, how
is that going?
Mrs. Bing  (on TV) Oh, fine. I'm leaving for New York tomorrow, which I hate-
but I get to see my son, who I love...
All  Awww!
Chandler  This is the way that I find out. Most moms use the phone.
Jay Leno  (on TV) Y'know, don't take this wrong, I-I just don't see you a-as a
mom, somehow.. I don't mean that, I don't mean that bad...
Mrs. Bing  (on TV) Oh no, I am a fabulous mom! I bought my son his first
condoms.
Chandler  ...And then he burst into flames.
[Scene  The Hospital, it's a montage of Monica and Phoebe's visit to the hospital with My
Guy playing in the background.  It starts with Monica reading a newspaper to
him.]
Monica  Let's see. Congress is debating a new deficit reduction bill... the
mayor wants to raise subway fares again... the high today was forty-five... and- oh, teams
played sports.
Phoebe  What about Glen? He could be a Glen.
Monica  Nah... not-not special enough.
Phoebe  Ooh! How about Agamemnon?
Monica  Waaay too special.
[Scene  A Mexican Restaurant, Monica, Phoebe, Joey, Chandler and his mom are there.]
Mrs. Bing  I am famished. What do I want... (Looks at Chandler's menu)
Chandler  Please God don't let it be Kung Pow Chicken.
Mrs. Bing  Oh, you watched the show! What'd you think?
Chandler  Well, I think you need to come out of your shell just a little.
Ross  (Entering) What is this dive? Only you could've picked this place.
Mrs. Bing  Oooh, c'mon, shut up, it's fun. Gimme a hug. (They both sit down)
Well, I think we're ready for some tequila.
Chandler  I know I am.
Mrs. Bing  Who's doing shots?
Monica  Yeah.
Phoebe  I'm in.
Mrs. Bing  There y'go. Ross?
Ross  Uh, I'm not really a shot drinking kinda guy.
Rachel  Hi! Sorry- sorry we're late, we, uh, kinda just, y'know, lost track of
time.
Ross  ...But a man can change. (Downs a shot)
Ross  Anyone want me to appraise anything?
Rachel  Mrs. Bing, I have to tell you, I've read everything you've ever written.
No, I mean it! I mean, when I read Euphoria at Midnight, all I wanted to do was become a
writer.
Mrs. Bing  Oh, please, honey, listen, if I can do it, anybody can. You just
start with half a dozen European cities, throw in thirty euphemisms for male genitalia,
and bam! You have got yourself a book.
Chandler  Myyy mother, ladies and gentlemen.
Mrs. Bing  Yeah, any messages for room 226?
Mrs. Bing  You okay there, slugger?
Ross  Yeah, I'm fine, I'm fine. (A woman emerges from the toilet behind him and
he tries to pretend he was in the other one)
Mrs. Bing  What is with you tonight?
Ross  Nothing. Nothing nothing nothing.
Mrs. Bing  (To phone) Okay, thank you. (To Ross) It's the Italian Hand-Licker,
isn't it.
Ross  No. It's the one he's licking.
Mrs. Bing  She's supposed to be with you.
Ross  You're good.
Mrs. Bing  Oh, Ross, listen to me. I have sold a hundred million copies of my
books, and y'know why?
Ross  The girl on the cover with her nipples showing?
Mrs. Bing  No. Because I know how to write men that women fall in love with.
Believe me, I cannot sell a Paolo. People will not turn three hundred twenty-five pages
for a Paolo. C'mon, the guy's a secondary character, a, y'know, complication you
eventually kill off.
Ross  When?
Mrs. Bing  He's not a hero. ...You know who our hero is.
Ross  The guy on the cover with his nipples showing?
Mrs. Bing  No, it's you!
Ross  Please.
Mrs. Bing  No, really, c'mon. You're smart, you're sexy...
Ross  Right.
Mrs. Bing  You are gonna be fine, believe me.
Ross  Uh-oh...
Joey  Uhhhh.... I'll just pee in the street.
[Scene  Chandler and Joey's, the next morning. Joey is getting the door in his dressing
gownit's Ross.]
Ross  Hey, is Chandler here?
Joey  Yeah.
Ross  Okay, uh, about last night, um, Chandler.. you didn't tell... (Joey shakes
his head) Okay, 'cause I'm thinking- we don't need to tell Chandler, I mean, it was just a
kiss, right? One kiss? No big deal? Right?
Joey  Right. No big deal.
Ross  Okay.
Joey  In Bizarro World!! You broke the code!
Ross  What code?
Joey  You don't kiss your friend's mom! Sisters are okay, maybe a hot-lookin'
aunt... but not a mom, never a mom!
Chandler  What are you guys doing out here?
Ross  Uh.. uh.. Well, Joey and I had discussed getting in an early morning
racquetball game. But, um, apparently, somebody overslept.
Joey  Yeah, well, you don't have your racket.
Ross  No, no I don't, because it's being restrung, somebody was supposed to
bring me one.
Joey  Yeah, well you didn't call and leave your grip size.
Chandler  Okay, you guys spend waaaay too much time together. (Goes back inside
and shuts the door)
Ross  Okay, I'm scum, I'm scum.
Joey  Ross, how could you let this happen?
Ross  I don't know, God, I... well, it's not like she's a regular mom, y'know?
She's, she's sexy, she's...
Joey  You don't think my mom's sexy?
Ross  Well... not in the same way...
Joey  I'll have you know that Gloria Tribbiani was a handsome woman in her day,
alright? You think it's easy giving birth to seven children?
Ross  Okay, I think we're getting into a weird area here...
Rachel  Hey.
Ross  Hey.
Rachel  What're you guys doing out here?
Ross  Well, not playing raquetball!
Joey  He forgot to leave his grip size!
Ross  He didn't get the goggles!
Rachel  Well,sounds like you two have issues.
Rachel  Goodbye, baby.
Paolo  Ciao, bela.
Ross  Do they wait for me to do this?
Joey  So are you gonna tell him?
Ross  Why would I tell him?
Joey  How about 'cause if you don't, his mother might.
Ross  Oh...
Monica  (Entering) What are you guys doing here?
Joey  Uhhhh.... he's not even wearing a jockstrap!
Monica  ...What did I ask?
[Scene  Hospital. Phoebe is there stroking Coma Guy's hair, when Monica enters with a
bunch of balloons.]
Monica  Hi.
Phoebe  Hi.
Monica  What are you doing here?
Phoebe  Nothing, I just thought I'd stop by.. y'know, after the uh... that I..
y'know, so what are you doing here?
Monica  I'm not really here. Just thought I'd drop these off...on the way.. my
way... Do you come here a lot? Without me?
Phoebe  No. (Monica brushes Coma Guy's hair in the other direction) No! No!
...So, um, do you think he's doing any better than he was this morning?
Monica  How would I know? I-I wasn't here.
Phoebe  Really? Not even to, um, change his PAJAMAS?! (Whips back the sheet to
reveal him wearing new pajamas.)
[Scene  Chandler and Joey's, Ross is talking to Chandler. Joey is making a snack at the
bar.]
Chandler  Oh my God.
Ross  You're my friend. I-I had to tell you.
Chandler  I can't believe it. Paolo kissed my mom?
Ross  Yeah, um, I don't know if you noticed, but he had a lot to drink, and you
know how he gets when he's drun..uh... (He has caught sight of Joey scowling at him) I
can't do this, I did it, it was me, I'm sorry, I kissed your mom.
Chandler  What?
Ross  I was really upset about Rachel and Paolo, and I think I had too much
tequila, and Nora- um, Mrs. Mom- your Bing- was just being nice, y'know, and- But nothing
happened, nothing- Ask Joey, Joey, uh, came in-
Chandler  (To Joey) You knew about this?
Joey  Uh... y'know, knowledge is a tricky thing.
Chandler  I spent the entire day with you, why didn't you tell me?!
Joey  Hey, hey, hey, you're lucky I caught them when I did, or else who knows
what woulda happened.
Ross  Thanks, man, big help.
Chandler  (To Ross) I can't believe this! What the hell were you thinking?
Ross  I wasn't- I mean, I-
Chandler  Y'know, of all my friends, no-one knows the crap I go through with my
mom more than you.
Ross  I know-
Chandler  I can't believe you did this. (Walks toward the door)
Ross  Chandler-
Joey  Me neither, y'know what-
Chandler  I'm still mad at you for not telling me.
Joey  What are you mad at me for?!
Ross  Chandler-
Chandler  You gotta let me slam the door! (Leaves; slams the door)
Joey  (Shouting after him) Chandler, I didn't kiss her, he did! (To Ross) See
what happens when you break the code?
Ross  Joey-
Joey  Ah! (Points to door) Huh? (Leaves and slams the door)
[Scene  Central Perk, everyone is there except for Chandler.  Rachel is writing
something and Monica walks up.]
Monica  Hey.
Rachel  Hey.
Monica  (Reading) 'A Woman Undone, by Rachel Karen Green'.
Rachel  Yeah. Thought I'd give it a shot. I'm still on the first chapter. Now,
do you think his 'love stick can be liberated from its denim prison'?
Monica  (Reads) Yeah, I'd say so. And there's no 'j' in 'engorged'.
Phoebe  (Walks up with her guitar) Hey Rach.
Rachel  Hey.
Phoebe  Hello.
Monica  Hello.
Phoebe  Going to the hospital tonight?
Monica  No, you?
Phoebe  No, you?
Monica  You just asked me.
Phoebe  Okay, maybe it was a trick question. (Plays a few chords) Um, Rachel can
we do this now?
Rachel  Okay. (Writes a little more) I am so hot!
Joey  (To Ross, on the couch) Now, here's a picture of my mother and father on
their wedding day. Now you tell me she's not a knockout.
Ross  I cannot believe we're having this conversation.
Joey  C'mon! Just try to picture her not pregnant, that's all.
Rachel  (Into microphone) Central Perk is proud to present Miss Phoebe Buffay.
Rachel  (Into mike) Okay, that was Phoebe Buffay, everybody. Woo!
Chandler  What was that?
Ross  Oh, uh, Phoebe just started a...
Chandler  Yeah, I believe I was talking to Joey, alright there, Mother-Kisser?
(Goes to the counter)
Joey  (Laughing) Mother-Kisser... (Sees Ross's look) I'll shut up.
Ross  Chandler, can I just say something? I-I know you're still mad at me, I
just wanna say that there were two people there that night. Okay? Two sets of lips.
Chandler  Yes, well, I expect this from her. Okay? She's always been a Freudian
nightmare.
Ross  Okay, well, if she always behaves like this, why don't you say something?
Chandler  Because it's complicated, it's complex- Hey, you kissed my mom!
Ross  (To the rest of Central Perk) We're rehearsing a Greek play.
Chandler  That's very funny. We done now?
Ross  No! Okay, you mean, you're not gonna talk to her, you're not gonna tell
her how you feel?
Chandler  That would be no. Look, just because you played tonsil tennis with my
mom doesn't mean you know her. Alright? Trust me, you can't talk to her.
Ross  Okay, 'you' can't, or (Points to Chandler) you can't? (Chandler grabs his
finger) Okay, that's my finger. (Chandler twists it and Ross goes down on one knee)
That's, that's my knee. (To Central Perk) Still doing the play. Aaah!
[Scene  The Coma Guy's Room, Monica bursts in, closely followed by Phoebe. There is no
sign of Coma Guy.  His bed is empty.]
Phoebe  Alright, whadyou do with him?
Monica  Oh! You're awake!
Phoebe  Look at you! How, how do you feel?
Coma Guy  Uh, a little woozy, but basically okay.
Monica  You look good!
Coma Guy  I feel good! ...Who are you?
Monica  Oh, sorry.
Phoebe  I'm Phoebe Buffay.
Monica  I'm Monica Geller. I've been taking care of you.
Phoebe  Well, we both have.
Coma Guy  So, the Etch-a-Sketch is from you guys?
Phoebe  Well, actually it's just from me.
Monica  I got you the foot massager.
Phoebe  You know who shaved you? That was me.
Monica  I read to you.
Phoebe  I sang. (To Monica) Hah!
Coma Guy  Well,... thanks.
Monica  Oh, my pleasure.
Phoebe  You're welcome.
Coma Guy  So. I guess I'll see you around.
Phoebe  What, that's it?
Monica  "See you around?"
Coma Guy  Well, what do you want me to say?
Monica  Oh, I don't know. Maybe, um, "That was nice?" Admit something
to me? "I'll call you?"
Coma Guy  Alright, I'll call you.
Phoebe  I don't think you mean that.
Monica  This is so typical. Y'know, we give, and we give, and we give. And then-
we just get nothing back! And then one day, y'know, it's just, you wake up, and "See
you around!" Let's go, Phoebe.
Phoebe  Y'know what? We thought you were different. But I guess it was just the
coma.
[Scene  Chandler and Joey's Chandler is talking with his mom.]
Mrs. Bing  Car's waiting downstairs, I just wanted to drop off these copies of
my book for your friends. Anything you want from Lisbon?
Chandler  No, just knowing you're gonna be there is enough.
Mrs. Bing  Alright, well, be good, I love you. (Kisses him and goes to leave)
Chandler  You kissed my best Ross! ...Or something to that effect.
Mrs. Bing  (Reentering) O-kay. Look, it, it was stupid.
Chandler  Really stupid.
Mrs. Bing  Really stupid. And I don't even know how it happened. I'm sorry,
honey, I promise it will never happen again. Are we okay now?
Chandler  Yeah. No. No...
Ross  Ah, the forbidden love of a man and his door.
Joey  Shh. He did it. He told her off, and not just about the kiss, about
everything.
Ross  You're kidding.
Joey  No, no. He said "When are you gonna grow up and start being a
mom?"
Ross  Wow!
Joey  Then she came back with "The question is, when are you gonna grow up
and realise I have a bomb?"
Ross  'Kay, wait a minute, are you sure she didn't say "When are you gonna
grow up and realise I am your mom?"
Joey  That makes more sense.
Ross  So, what's going on now?
Joey  I dunno, I've been standing here spelling it out for you! (Goes back to
the door) I don't hear anything. Oh, wait, wait, wait. (Looks through the spyhole)
Ross  Whaddya see?
Joey  Hard to tell, they're so tiny and upside-down. Wait, wait. They're walking
away... they're walking away... No, no they're not, they're coming right at us! Run! Run!
Mrs. Bing  You okay, kiddo?
Chandler  Yeah, okay.
Mrs. Bing  Alright. (Kisses him)
Chandler  Nice save.
Ross  (Very politely) Mrs. Bing.
Mrs. Bing  Mr. Geller.
Chandler  Hey.
Ross  You mean that?
Chandler  Yeah, why not. (They shake hands) So I told her.
Ross  Yeah? How'd it go?
Chandler  Awful. Awful. Couldn'ta gone worse.
Ross  Well, howdya feel?
Chandler  Pretty good! I told her.
Ross  Well, see? So, maybe it wasn't such a bad idea, y'know, me kissing your
mom, uh? Huh? (Wags his finger at Chandler, then puts it down) But.. we don't have to go
down that road.
[Scene  Monica and Rachel's, Rachel is handing out copies of her book to the gang.]
Rachel  Okay. Now this is just the first chapter, and I want your absolute
honest opinion. Oh, oh, and on page two, he's not 'reaching for her heaving beasts'.
Monica  What's a 'niffle'?
Joey  You usually find them on the 'heaving beasts'.
Rachel  Alright, alright, so I'm not a great typist...
Ross  Wait, did you get to the part about his 'huge throbbing pens'? Tell ya,
you don't wanna be around when he starts writing with those!
Rachel  Alright, that's it! Give it back! That's it!
All  Nooo!
[Scene  Central Perk, everyone is there. Ross working on
crossword puzzle, starts humming theme from The Odd Couple. Chandler joins in,
followed by Monica and Phoebe, then the whole gang. Ross starts humming theme from I
Dream Of Jeannie.]
Chandler  No-no-no-no, we're done.
[Scene  Monica and Rachel's, Monica is on the phone in the kitchen.]
Monica  Aunt Syl, stop yelling! All I'm saying is that if you had told
me vegetarian lasagna, I would have made vegetarian lasagna. (pauses, listens to person on
phone) Well, the meat's only every third layer, maybe you could scrape.
Joey  Ross, did you really read all these baby books?
Ross  Yup! You could plunk me down in the middle of any woman's uterus, no
compass, and I can find my way out of there like that! (snaps fingers)
Phoebe  Ooh, this is cool...it says in some parts of the world, people actually
eat the placenta. (Joey grimaces)
Chandler  And, we're done with the yogurt. (Sets yogurt down on table)
Phoebe  (softly) Sorry. (Camera pans back to Monica, still on phone)
Monica  Aunt Syl, I did this as a favor, I am not a caterer. What do you want me
to do with a dozen lasagnas? (listens to Aunt Syl on phone, looks shocked) Nice talk, Aunt
Syl. (in New York accent) You kiss Uncle Freddie with that mouth?
Joey  Hey Ross, listen, you know that right now, your baby's only this big?
(measures about 2 inches with his thumb and index finger) This is your baby. (in baby-like
voice) Hi Daddy!
Ross  (waves) Hello!
Joey  (in baby-like voice) How come you don't live with Mommy? (pause;
shows Ross less than amused) How come Mommy lives with that other lady? (pause; Ross still
looks less than amused; Joey smiling) What's a lesbian? (playfully hits Ross)
Rachel  Honey, you can say it, Poconos, Poconos, it's like Poc-o-nos (touching
Paolo's nose with forefinger with each syllable)
Paolo  Ah, poke (Paolo touches Rachel's nose) a (touches nose again)
nose, mmm (they rub noses, then kisses her)
Joey, Chandler, and Ross  (sitting in living room, imitating Paolo)
Mma, Mma, Mmaah
Monica  So, did I hear Poconos?
Rachel  Yes, my sister's giving us her place for the weekend.
Phoebe  Woo-hoo, first weekend away together!
Monica  Yeah, that's a big step.
Rachel  I know...
Chandler  (to Ross) Ah, it's just a weekend, big deal!
Ross  Wasn't this supposed to be just a fling, huh? Shouldn't it be...(makes
flinging motions with hands) flung by now?
Rachel  I mean, we are way past the fling thing, I mean, I am feeling things
that I've only read about in Danielle Steele books, you know? I mean, when I'm with him,
I'm totally, totally...
Ross  ...nauseous, I'm physically nauseous. What am I supposed to do, huh? Call
immigration? (pauses, looks suddenly inspired) I could call immigration!
[Scene  The Hallway, Chandler and Joey leaving girls' apartment, carrying lasagna.]
Joey  I love babies, with their little baby shoes, and their little baby toes,
and their little baby hands...
Chandler  Ok, you're going to have to stop that, forever!
Joey  Need a new table.
Chandler  You think?
[Scene  Carol and Susan's, there's a knock on the door and Carol answers it to Ross.]
Carol  Hey hey, come on in!
Ross  Hey, hello! mmwa! (kisses Carol) I brought all the books, and Monica sends
her love, along with this lasagna.
Carol  Oh great! Is it vegetarian, 'cause Susan doesn't eat meat.
Ross  (pauses) I'm pretty sure that it is...
Carol  So, I got the results of the amnio today.
Ross  (making flinging gestures with hands) Oh, tell me, tell me, is
everything, uhh....?
Carol  Totally and completely healthy!
Ross  Oh, that's great, that is great! (Hugs and kisses Carol. Then picks up a
picture frame)
Ross  Hey, when did you and Susan meet Huey Lewis?
Carol  Uh, that's our friend Tanya.
Ross  (surprised, chuckling nervously) Of course it's your friend
Tanya. (looks up frightenedly)
Carol  Don't you want to know about the sex?
Ross  (chuckles nervously) The sex? (chuckles) Um, I'm having enough
trouble with the image of you and Susan together, when you throw in Tanya (miming washing
hair, that's the best I could think of), yaw...
Carol  The sex of the baby, Ross.
Ross  Oh, you know the sex of the baby? Oh, oh-oh-oh!
Carol  Do you want to know?
Ross  No, no, no, no, no, I don't want to know, absolutely not. I think, you
know, I think you should know until you look down there, and say, oop, there it is!
(pauses) Or isn't...
Susan  Oh, hello Ross!
Ross  Susan...
Susan  So, so, did you hear?
Ross  Yes, we did, everything's A-OK!
Susan  Oh, that's so... (Susan hugs Carol, they giggle, Ross steps away) It
really is...do we know...?
Carol  Yes, we certainly do, it's going to be...
Ross  (flailing arms in protest) Oh, hey hey hey, ho ho ho, hello, guy
who doesn't want to know, standing right here!
Susan  Oh, well, is it what we thought it would be?
Carol  Mm-hmmm (Susan and Carol hug, giggling. Ross stands back, reaches out and
lightly taps Susan's shoulder)
Ross  Ok, what, what...ok, what did we think it was going to be?
Carol and Susan  It's a...
Ross  (interrupts) No, no, no I don't want to know, don't want to
know. Ok, you know, I should probably, I should probably just go.
Carol  Well, thanks for the books.
Ross  No problem, ok, mmmwa (kisses Carol) oh, mmmwa (kisses Carol's stomach,
then punches Susan's shoulder) Susan... (Ross leaves.)
Susan  All right, who should we call first, your folks, or Deb and Rona?
(intercom buzzer rings)
Carol  Hello?
Ross  (on intercom) Uh, never mind, I don't want to know. (Carol and
Susan laugh)
[Scene  Chandler and Joey's,  Joey and Chandler use their knees as a table to
support the lasagna.]
Chandler  Ok, so it's just because it was my table, I have to buy a new one?
Joey  That's the rule.
Chandler  What rule? There's no rule, if anything, you owe me a table!
Joey  How'd you get to that?
Chandler  Well, I believe the piece of furniture was fine until your little
breakfast adventure with Angela Delvecchio
Joey  You knew about that?
Chandler  Well, let's just say the impressions you made in the butter left
little to the imagination.
Joey  Ok, ok, How about if we split it?
Chandler  What do you mean, like, buy it together?
Joey  Yeah
Chandler  You think we're ready for something like that?
Joey  Why not?
Chandler  Well, it's a pretty big commitment, I mean, what if one of us wants to
move out?
Joey  Why, are you moving out?
Chandler  I'm not moving out.
Joey  You'd tell me if you were moving out right
Chandler  Yeah, yeah, it's just that with my last roommate Kip...
Joey  Aw, I know all about Kip!
Chandler  It's just that we bought a hibachi together, and then he ran off and
got married, and things got pretty ugly.
Joey  Well, let me ask you something, was Kip a better roommate than me?
Chandler  Aw, don't do that
[Scene  Phoebe's Massage Parlor, Phoebe's assistant is telling her about the changes to
her schedule.]
Phoebe  Ok, thanks. (assistant leaves, then walks back in)
Paolo  Buon Giorno, Bella Phoebe!
Phoebe  Oh, Paolo, hi, what are you doing here?
Paolo  Uh, Racquela tell me you massage, eh?
Phoebe  Well, Racquela's right, yeah!
Phoebe  Oh, okay, I don't know what you just said, so let's get started.
Paolo  Uh, I am, uh, being naked?
Phoebe  Um, that's really your decision, I mean, some people prefer, you know,
to take off...oh whoops! You're being naked!
[Scene  Central Perk, everyone but Phoebe is there.]
Rachel  (to Ross) I can't believe you don't want to know. I mean, I
couldn't not know, I mean, if, if the doctor knows, and Carol knows, and Susan knows....
Monica  And Monica knows...
Ross  Wha, heh, how could you know, I don't even know!
Monica  Carol called me to thank me for the lasagna, I asked, she told me.
Joey  So what's it gonna be? (Monica whispers in Joey's ear. Ross gets up and
waves arms frantically in protest)
Ross  Waitohheyhuh, oh great now he knows, and I don't know!
Monica  I'm sorry, I'm just excited about being an aunt!
Joey  Or an uncle...
Joey and Chandler  Hey Phoebe!
Ross  Hi Pheebs!
Rachel  Pheebs!
Phoebe  Fine!
Monica  Phoebe, what's the matter?
Phoebe  Nothing, I'm sorry, I'm just, I'm out of sorts.
Customer  Hey, can we get some cappuccino over here?
Rachel  Oh, right, that's me!
Joey  Hey, Chandler, that table place closes at 7, come on.
Chandler  Fine. (Joey and Chandler walk towards the door)
Monica  Phoebe, what is it?
Phoebe  All right, you know Paolo?
Ross  I'm familiar with his work, yes...
Phoebe  Well, he made a move on me.
Joey  Whoa, store will be open tomorrow!
Chandler  More coffee over here, please!
[Scene  Central Perk, continued from earlier.]
Monica  Well, what happened?
Phoebe  Well, he came in for a massage, and everything was fine until.
(A flashback starts Paolo, lying on massage table, moving his hands up Phoebe's legs.)
Joey and Chandler   Ooooohh!
Ross  My God.
Monica  Are you sure?
Monica  Was it...?
Phoebe  Oh, boy scouts could have camped under there.
Guys  Oooooo....
Rachel  "Ooo," what?
Phoebe  Uma Thurman.
Monica  Oh!
Ross  The actress!
Ross  Thanks Rach.
Chandler  So what are you gonna do?
Ross  You have to tell her! You have to tell her! It's your moral obligation, as
a friend, as a woman, I think it's a feminist issue! Guys? Guys? (waiting for guys to
chime in)
Chandler  Oh, yeah, you have to tell her.
Joey  Feminist issue. That's where I went!
Phoebe  She is gonna hate me.
Ross (sympathetic yet...) Yeah, well...
[Scene  The Table Store, Joey and Chandler and looking for their new table.]
Joey  Will you pick one, just pick one! Here, how about that one? (points to a
table)
Chandler  That's patio furniture!
Joey  So what, like people are gonna come in and think, "Uh-oh, I'm outside
again?" Of course!
Chandler  (gesturing towards another table) What about the birds?
Joey  I don't know, birds just don't say, "Hello, sit here, eat
something."
Chandler  You pick one.
Joey  All right, how about the ladybugs?
Chandler  Oh, so, forget about the birds, but big red insects suggest fine
dining!
Joey  Fine, you want to get the birds, get the birds!
Chandler  Not like that, I won't! (pauses) Kip would have liked the birds! (Joey
turns and gives Chandler a dirty look)
[Scene  Monica and Rachel's, Rachel folding and packing clothes in suitcases as Phoebe
enters.]
Phoebe  Hey!
Rachel  Hi Pheebs!
Phoebe  Are you moving out?
Rachel  No, these aren't all my suitcases. (picks up small blue suitcase and
shows to Phoebe) This one's Paolo's.
Phoebe  Um, um, Rachel can we talk for a sec?
Rachel  Well, sure...just a sec, though, 'cause Paolo's on his way over.
Phoebe  Oh! (sits down) Ok, um, ok, um,
Rachel  Oh, Pheebs, Pheebs...
Phoebe  Ok, um, (clears throat) we haven't known each other for that long a
time, and, um, there are three things that you should know about me. One, my friends are
the most important thing in my life, two, I never lie, and three, I make the best oatmeal
raisin cookies in the world. (Phoebe opens a tin and offers Rachel a cookie)
Rachel  (taking cookie) Ok, thanks Pheebs (takes bite of cookie,
overwhelmed) Oh my God, why have I never tasted these before?!
Phoebe  Oh, I don't make them a lot because I don't think it's fair to the other
cookies
Rachel  All right, well, you're right, these are the best oatmeal cookies I've
ever had.
Phoebe  Which proves that I never lie.
Rachel  I guess you don't.
Phoebe  Paolo made a pass at me.
[Scene  Chandler and Joey's, Ross, Chandler, Joey, and Monica admiring their new
table.]
Chandler  So, what do you think?
Ross  I think It's the most beautiful table I've ever seen.
Chandler  I know!
Monica  So how does this work, you going to balance the plates on these little
guys' heads?
Joey  Who cares, we'll eat at the sink! Come on, let's play!
Monica  Heads up Ross! (Monica scores on Chandler and Joey) Score! (points at
Chandler) You suck!
[Scene  Monica and Rachel's, Rachel is recovering from the shock.]
Phoebe  Are you okay?
Rachel  I need some milk.
Phoebe  Ok, I've got milk (takes thermos from her bag and starts to pour a cup)
Here you go... (Rachel drinks straight from thermos) Oh!(Rachel finishes thermos) Better?
Rachel  No...oh, I feel so stupid! Oh, I think about the other
day with you guys and I was all "Oh, Paolo, he's so great, he makes me feel
so..." Oh, God, I'm so embarrassed!
Phoebe  I'm so embarrassed, I'm the one he hit on!
Rachel  Pheebs, if I had never met him this never would have happened!
Rachel and Phoebe  I'm so sorry! No I'm sorry! No I'm sorry! No
I'm sorry!
Phoebe  No, wait, oh, what are we sorry about?
Rachel  I don't know...right, he's the pig!
Phoebe  Such a pig!
Rachel  Oh, God, he's such a pig,
Phoebe  Oh he's like a...
Rachel  He's like a big disgusting...
Phoebe  ...like a...
Rachel  ...pig...pig man!
Phoebe  Yes, good! Ok...
Rachel  (voice wavers) Oh, but he was my pig man...how did I not see this?
Phoebe  (raises hand) Oh! I know! (Rachel startled) It's because... he's
gorgeous, and he's charming, and when he looks at you...
Rachel  Ok, Ok, Pheebs...
Phoebe  The end.
Rachel  Oh, God...
Phoebe  Should I not have told you?
Rachel  No, no, trust, me, it's, it's, it's much better that I know. Uh, I just
liked it better before it was better...
[Scene  Chandler and Joey's, Phoebe is telling everyone how it went across the hall as
the foosball game continues.]
Phoebe  I think she took it pretty well. You know Paolo's over there right now,
so...
Monica  We should get over there and see if she's okay. (switching
places with Ross) Just one...second! Score! (Monica scores, high-fives with Ross) Game!
Come on. (Monica and Phoebe leave)
Ross  (wiping his brow) Ah...ooh! Well, looks like, uh, we kicked your
butts.
Joey  No-no, she kicked our butts. You could be on the Olympic standing-there
team.
Ross  Come on, two on one.
Chandler  What are you still doing here? She just broke up with the guy, it's
time for you to swoop in!
Ross  What, now?
Joey  Yes, now is when you swoop! You gotta make sure that when Paolo walks out
of there, the first guy Rachel sees is you, She's gotta know that you're everything he's
not! You're like, like the anti-Paolo!
Chandler  My Catholic friend is right. She's distraught. You're there for her.
You pick up the pieces, and then you usher in the age of Ross! (Ross and Chandler look off
into the distance. Joey, wondering what they are looking at, looks in the same direction)
[Scene  Monica and Rachel's Balcony, Rachel is throwing Paolo's clothes over the side.]
Paolo  No, that's cold, that's cold, that's...
Ross  (entering) How's it going?
Monica  Don't stare. Now she just finished throwing his clothes off the balcony,
now there's just a lot of gesturing and arm-waving, (shows Rachel gesturing with hands in
front of her chest), Ok, that is either, "How could you?" or, "Enormous
breasts!" Here he comes!
Phoebe  Ooh!
Paolo  Uh, I am, uh, to say good-bye.
Phoebe  Oh, ok bye-bye.
Monica  Paolo, I really hate you for what you did to Rachel, (hands him a
lasagna) but I still have five of these, so heat it at 375 until the cheese bubbles.
Paolo  Grazie.
Ross  Paolo, I-I just want to tell you and I think I speak for everyone when I
say... (shuts door in his face and walks away)
Phoebe  Oh, just look at her... (girls move toward Rachel on the balcony)
Ross  Oh you guys, I-I really think just one of us should go out there so she's
not overwhelmed...
Monica  Oh, you're right.
Ross  (pulls Monica back) ...and I really think it should be me.
Ross  Hey.
Rachel  Hey.
Ross  You all right?
Rachel  Ooh, I've been better...
Ross  Come here. (he hugs Rachel) Listen, you deserve so much better than
him...you know, I mean, you, you, you should be with a guy who knows what he has when he
has you.
Rachel  Oh, Ross...
Ross  What?
Rachel  I am so sick of guys. I don't want to look at another guy, I don't want
to think about another guy, I don't even want to be near another guy. (Ross crosses arms)
Ross  Huh.
Rachel  Oh Ross, you're so great!
Ross  Ohhhh (Hugs her and sighs)
Monica  Ooh...hey honey, are you all right?
Rachel  Oh...
Phoebe  You ok?
Rachel  ...medium...hmm...any cookies left?
Phoebe  Yep!
Ross  See, Rach, uh, see, I don't think that swearing off guys altogether is the
answer. I really don't. I think that what you need is to develop a more sophisticated
screening process.
Rachel  No. I just need to be by myself for a while, you know? I just got to
figure out what I want
Ross  Uh, no, no, see, because not...not all guys are going to be a Paolo.
Rachel  No, I know, I know, and I'm sure your little boy is not going to grow up
to be one.
Ross  (astonished) What?
Rachel  What?
Ross  I-I'm, I'm having a boy?
Rachel  Uh...no. No, no, in fact, you're not having a boy.
Ross  Wha-I'm having, I'm having a boy! (babbling) Huh, am I having a boy?
Girls  Yes, you're having a boy! (Monica runs over and hugs Ross)
Ross  I'm having a boy! Oh, I'm having a boy!
Chandler  Wha-
Joey  Wha-
Joey and Chandler  What is it?
Ross  I'm having a boy! I-I'm having a boy!
Joey  Hey!
Chandler  Hey!
Joey and Chandler  We already knew that! (they hug)
Ross  I'm having a son. Um...
[Scene  Chandler and Joey's, Monica is busy killing Chandle and Joey at foosball.]
Monica  Yes! And that would be a shut-down!
Joey and Chandler  Shut-out!! (They both start heading for
their rooms.)
Monica  Where are you guys going? Come on, one more game!
Chandler  Yeah, get out!
Monica  You guys are always hanging out in my apartment! Come on, I'll only use
my left hand, huh? Come on, wussies! (Joey and Chandler pick her up) All right, ok, I
gotta go. I'm going, (they throw her out) and I'm gone.
Chandler  (to Joey) One more game?
Joey  Oh yeah!
[Scene  Monica and Rachel's, Chandler walks in and starts raiding the
fridge. Then Rachel comes out of the shower with a towel wrapped round her waist, drying
herself with another towel. Chandler and Rachel startle each other and she drops the towel
for a second and snatches the rug off the couch.]
Rachel  That is it! You just barge in here, you don't knock
Chandler  I'm sorry!
Rachel  You have no respect for anybody's privacy!
Chandler  Rachel, wait, wait.
Rachel  No, you wait! This is ridiculous!
Chandler  Can I just say one thing?
Rachel  What? What?!
Chandler  That's a relatively open weave and I can still see your... nipular
areas.
Rachel  Oh!!
[Scene  Central Perk, Phoebe is there with her boyfriend Roger, talking to Rachel and
Monica.]
Phoebe  Oh, honey, honey, tell them the story about your patient who thinks
things are, like, other things. Y'know? Like, the phone rings and she takes a shower.
Roger  That's pretty much it.
Phoebe  Oops!
Roger  But you tell it really well, sweetie.
Phoebe  Thanks. Okay, now go away so we can talk about you.
Roger  Okay. I'll miss you.
Phoebe  Isn't he great?
Rachel  He's so cute! And he seems to like you so much.
Phoebe  I know, I know. So sweet... and so complicated. And for a shrink, he's
not too shrinky, y'know?
Monica  So, you think you'll do it on his couch?
Phoebe  Oh, I don't know, I don't know. I think that's a little weird, y'know?
Vinyl.
Rachel  Okaaay. (To the guys, on the couch) Any of you guys want anything else?
Chandler  Oh, yes, could I have one of those. (Points)
Rachel  No, I'm sorry, we're all out of those. Anybody else?
Chandler  Okay.
Roger  Did I, uh, did I miss something?
Chandler  No, she's still upset because I saw her boobies.
Ross  You what? Wh what were you doing seeing her boobies?
Chandler  It was an accident. Not like I was across the street with a telescope
and a box of donuts.
Rachel  Okay, okay, could we change the subject, please?
Phoebe  Yeah, 'cause hello, these are not her boobies, these are her breasts.
Rachel  Okay, Pheebs, I was hoping for more of a change.
Chandler  Y'know, I don't know why you're so embarrassed, they were very nice
boobies.
Rachel  Nice? They were nice. I mean, that's it? I mean, mittens are nice.
Chandler  Okaaay, (Gestures) rock, hard place, me.
Roger  You're so funny! He's really funny! I wouldn't wanna be there when when
the laughter stops.
Chandler  Whoah whoah, back up there, Sparky. What'd you mean by that?
Roger  Oh, just seems as though that maybe you have intimacy issues. Y'know,
that you use your humour as a way of keeping people at a distance.
Chandler  Huh.
Roger  I mean hey! I just met you, I don't know you from Adam. ...Only child,
right? Parents divorced before you hit puberty.
Chandler  Uhhuh, how did you know that?
Roger  It's textbook.
Joey  Hey you guys. Hey, you all know my dad, right?
All  Hey! Hey, Mr. Trib!
Monica  Hey, how long are you in the city?
Mr. Tribbiani  Just for a coupla days. I got a job midtown. I figure I'm better
off staying with the kid than hauling my ass back and forth on the ferry. (Sees Roger) I
don't know this one.
Phoebe  Oh, this is my friend Roger.
Roger  Hi.
Mr. Tribbiani  Hey, hey. Good to meet you, Roger.
Roger  You too, sir.
Mr. Tribbiani  (To Phoebe) What happened to the, uh, puppet guy?
Joey  Dad, dad. (Shakes his head)
Mr. Tribbiani  Oh, 'scuse me. So Ross, uh, how's the wife? (Ross whines and lays
his head on Chandler's shoulder) Off there too, uh? Uh, Chandler, quick, say something
funny!
[Scene  Chandler and Joey's, Mr. Tribbiani is on the phone.]
Mr. Tribbiani  Gotta go. I miss you too, I love you, but it's getting real late
now
Joey  (Snatches the phone) Hey Ma. Listen, I made the appointment with Dr.
Bazida, and... Excuse me? (To his dad) Did you know this isn't Ma?
Mr. Tribbiani  Her name's Ronni. She's a pet mortician.
Joey  Sure. So how long you been... (Goes back to chopping)
Mr. Tribbiani  Remember when you were a little kid, I used to take you to the
navy yard and show you the big ships?
Joey  Since then?!
Mr. Tribbiani  No, it's only been six years. I just wanted to put a nice memory
in your head so you'd know that I wasn't always such a terrible guy. ...Joe. Y'ever been
in love?
Joey  ...I d'know.
Mr. Tribbiani  Then y'haven't. You're burning your tomatoes.
Joey  You're one to talk. (Puts the mushrooms in a saucepan)
Mr. Tribbiani  Joe, your dad's in love big time. And the worst part of it is,
it's with two different women.
Joey  Oh man. Please tell me one of 'em is Ma.
Mr. Tribbiani  Of course, course one of 'em's Ma. What's the matter with you.
[Scene  Monica and Rachel's, Joey is lamenting to everyone about hid dad's affair.]
Joey  It's like if you woke up one day and found out your dad was leading this
double life. He's like actually some spy, working for the C.I.A. (Considers) That'd be
cool.... This blows!
Rachel  I know, I mean, why can't parents just stay parents? (She walks over
near Chandler and his gaze stays very obviously on her chest) Why do they have to become
people? Why do they have... (Notices Chandler) Why can't you stop staring at my breasts?
Chandler  (Without looking up) What? (Looks up) What?
Rachel  Did you not get a good enough look the other day?
Ross  Alright, alright. We're all adults here, there's only one way to resolve
this. Since you saw her boobies, I think, uh, you're gonna have to show her your peepee.
Chandler  Y'know, I don't see that happening?
Rachel  C'mon, he's right. Tit for tat.
Chandler  Well I'm not showing you my 'tat.'
Monica  Hello?
Phoebe  (Intercom) It's Phoebe.
Roger  (Intercom) And Rog.
Monica  C'mon up.
Chandler  (Sarcastic) Oh, good. Rog is here.
Joey  What's the matter with Rog?
Ross  Yeah.
Chandler  Oh, it's nothing, it's a little thing... I hate that guy.
Ross  What, so he was a little analytical. That's what he does, y'know? C'mon,
he's not that bad.
Ross  Y'see, that's where you're wrong. Why would I marry her if I thought on
any level thatthat she was a lesbian?
Roger  I dunno. Maybe you wanted your marriage to fail.
Ross  Why? Why would I why? Why? Why? Why?
Roger  I don't know. Maybe maybe low self-esteem, maybe maybe to compensate for
overshadowing a sibling, maybe you...
Monica  Wait-wait, go back to that sibling thing.
Roger  Well, I don't know. I mean, it's conceivable that you wanted to sabotage
your marriage so that the sibling would feel less of a failure in the eyes of the parents.
Ross  That that's ridiculous! I don't feel guilty for her failures!
Monica  Oh! So you think I'm a failure!
Phoebe  Isn't he good?
Ross  Nonono, thatthat's not what I was saying...
Monica  Y'know, all these years, I thought you were on my side. But maybe what
you were doing was sucking up to Mom and Dad so they'd keep liking you better!
Ross  Hey, I married a lesbian to make you look good!
Rachel  You're right! I mean you're right! It wasn't just the Weebles, but it
was the Weeble Play Palace, and and the Weebles' Cruise Ship. Oh, which had this little
lifeboat for the Weebles to wobble in.
Roger  That's tough. Tough stuff. C'mon, Pheebs, we're gonna catch that movie,
we gotta get going.
Phoebe  Oh, okay. Feel better, Rachel, 'kay?
Roger  Geez, we're gonna be late, sweetie...
Phoebe  Oh, okay. Listen, thanks for everything, Mon.
Monica  You're welcome.
Roger  Listen guys, it was great seeing you again. Mon, um, easy on those
cookies, okay? Remember, they're just food, they're not love.
Monica  Hate that guy! (Throws another cookie)
[Scene  The Hallway, Chandler and Joey are just leaving Monica and Rachel's.]
Joey  Night, you guys.
Chandler  Oh look, it's the woman we ordered.
Joey  Hey. Can, uh, can we help you?
Ronni  Oh, no thanks, I'm just waiting for, uh, Joey Tribbiani.
Joey  I'm Joey Tribbiani.
Ronni  Oh no, not you, big Joey. Oh my God, you're so much cuter than your
pictures! (Joey stares at her) I-I'm, I'm Ronni....Cheese Nip?
Chandler  Uh, Joey's having an embolism, but I'd go for a Nip, y'know?
[Scene  Chandler and Joey's, Ronni is talking to Chandler. Joey's dad is not around.]
Ronni  Now, y'see, most people, when their pets pass on, they want 'em sorta
laid out like they're sleeping. But occasionally you get your person who wants them in a
pose. Like, chasing their tail, (Demonstrates) or, uh, jumping to catch a frisbee.
Chandler  Joey, if I go first, I wanna be looking for my keys.
Ronni  That's a good one!
Mr. Tribbiani  Hey, Joe.
Joey  Dad, Ronni's here.
Mr. Tribbiani  Huh?
Ronni  Hi.
Mr. Tribbiani  Hey! Hello, babe! Wh what're what're you doing here?
Ronni  Oh, uh, well, you left your good hair at my apartment, I figured you'd
need it tomorrow for your meeting. (Hands him the hair)
Mr. Tribbiani  Thank you. Uh...
Chandler  So, who's up for a big game of Kerplunk?
Ronni  Look, I uh, I shouldn'ta come. I-I'd better get going, I don't wanna miss
the last train.
Mr. Tribbiani  I don't want you taking that thing.
Ronni  Oh, where'm I gonna stay, here?
Joey  Who-ah-ho.
Mr. Tribbiani  We'll go to a hotel.
Ronni  (Shrugs) We'll go to a hotel.
Joey  No you won't.
Ronni  No we won't.
Joey  If you go to a hotel you'll be...doing stuff. I want you right here where
I can keep an eye on you.
Mr. Tribbiani  You're gonna keep an eye on us?
Joey  That's right, mister, and I don't care how old you are, as long as you're
under my roof you're gonna live by my rules. And that means no sleeping with your
girlfriend.
Ronni  Wow. He's strict.
Joey  Now dad, you'll be in my room, Ronni uh, you can stay in Chandler's room.
Ronni  Thanks. You're, uh, you're a good kid.
Chandler  C'mon, I'll show you to my room. ...That sounds so weird when it's not
followed by "No thanks, it's late."
Joey  Okay. Now this is just for tonight. Starting tomorrow, you gotta make a
change. This has gone on long enough.
Mr. Tribbiani  What kinda change?
Joey  Well, either you break it off with Ronni
Mr. Tribbiani  I can't do that!
Joey  Then you gotta come clean with Ma! This is not right!
Mr. Tribbiani  Yeah, but this is
Joey  I don't wanna hear it! Now go to my room!
[Scene  Chandler and Joey's, night. Chandler and Joey are sharing the sofabed in the
living room. Joey is restless.]
Chandler  Hey, Kicky. What're you doing?
Joey  Just trying to get comfortable. I can't sleep in my underwear.
Chandler  Well, you're gonna.
Joey  I've been thinking. Y'know, about how I'm always seeing girls on top of
girls...
Chandler  Are they end to end, or tall like pancakes?
Joey  Y'know what I mean, about how I'm always going out with all these women.
And I always figured, when the right one comes along, I'd be able to be a stand-up guy and
go the distance, y'know? Now I'm looking at my dad, thinking...
Chandler  Hey, you're not him. You're you. When they were all over you to go
into your father's pipe-fitting business, did you cave?
Joey  No.
Chandler  No. You decided to go into the out-of-work actor business. Now that
wasn't easy, but you did it! And I'd like to believe that when the right woman comes
along, you will have the courage and the guts to say "No thanks, I'm married."
Joey  You really think so?
Chandler  Yeah. I really do.
Joey  Thanks, Chandler. (Snuggles up to him)
Chandler  Get off!
[Scene  Monica and Rachel's, morning. Someone knocks on the door and Monica gets it.]
Ronni  Hi.
Monica  Hi...May I help you?
Ronni  Yeah, uh, Joey said I could use your shower, since, uh, Chandler's in
ours?
Monica  Okay...who are you?
Ronni  Oh, I'm Ronni. Ronni Rappelano? The mistress?
Monica  Oh, c'mon in.
Ronni  Thanks.
Rachel  Hi, I'm Rachel.
Ronni  Hi.
Rachel  Bathroom's up there.
Ronni  Great.
Rachel  Hey, listen, Ronni, how long would you say Chandler's been in the
shower?
Ronni  Oh, like, uh, five minutes?
Rachel  Perfect. Fasten your seatbelts, it's peepee time. (She goes into Joey
and Chandler's apartment, where Mr. Tribbiani is reading the paper) Hey, Mr. Trib.
Mr. Tribbiani  Hey. Morning, dear.
Rachel  Chandler Bing? It's time to see your thing.
Joey  (Runs out in a towel) What's the matter with you?!
Rachel  I thought it was Chandler!
Chandler  (Comes out of his room) What? What?
Rachel  You were supposed to be in there so I could see your thing!
Chandler  Sorry, my my thing was in there with me.
[Scene  Central Perk, everyone is there as Phoebe enters.]
All  Hey, Pheebs.
Phoebe  Hey.
Monica  How's it going?
Phoebe  Good. Oh oh! Roger's having a dinner thing and he wanted me to invite
you guys.
Phoebe  So what's going on?
Monica  Nothing, um, it's just, um... It's Roger.
Ross  I dunno, there's just something about...
Chandler  Basically we just feel that he's...
Rachel  We hate that guy.
All  Yeah. Hate him.
Ross  We're sorry, Pheebs, we're sorry.
Phoebe  Uh-huh. Okay. Okay, don't you think, maybe, though, it's just that he's
so perceptive that it freaks you out?
All  ...No, we hate him.
Rachel  We're sorry.
[Scene  Chandler and Joey's apartment, Joey is trying to turn the sofabed back into a
sofa. Someone knocks on the door and it rears up at him.]
Joey  Ma! What're you doing here?
Mrs. Tribbiani  I came to give you this (Gives him a bag of groceries) and this.
(Whacks him round the ear)
Joey  Oww! Big ring!
Mrs. Tribbiani  Why did you have to fill your father's head with all that
garbage about making things right? Things were fine the way they were! There's chicken in
there, put it away. For God's sake, Joey, really. (She gives the sofabed a tiny push and
it folds away)
Joey  Hold on, you-you knew?
Mrs. Tribbiani  Of course I knew! What did you think? Your father is no James
Bond. You should've heard some of his cover stories. "I'm sleeping over at my
accountant's," I mean, what is that? Please!
Joey  So then how could you I mean, how could you?!
Mrs. Tribbiani  Do you remember how your father used to be? Always yelling,
always yelling nothing made him happy, nothing made him happy, not that wood shop, not
those stupid little ships in the bottle, nothing. Now he's happy! I mean, it's nice, he
has a hobby.
Joey  Ma, I don't mean to be disrespectful, but... what the hell are you talking
about?! I mean, what about you?
Mrs. Tribbiani  Me? I'm fine. Look, honey, in an ideal world, there'd be no her,
and your father would look like Sting. And I'll tell you something else. Ever since that
poodle-stuffer came along, he's been so ashamed of himself that he's been more attentive,
he's been more loving... I mean, it's like every day's our anniversary.
Joey  I'm...happy...for you?
Mrs. Tribbiani  Well don't be, because now everything's screwed up. I just want
it the way it was.
Joey  Ma, I'm sorry. I just did what I thought you'd want.
Mrs. Tribbiani  I know you did, cookie. Oh, I know you did. So tell me. Did you
see her?
Joey  Yeah. You're ten times prettier than she is.
Mrs. Tribbiani  That's sweet. Could I take her?
Joey  With this ring? (Her engagement ring.) No contest.
[Scene  Central Perk. Phoebe is there with Roger.]
Roger  What's wrong, sweetie?
Phoebe  Nothing, nothing.
Roger  Aaaah, what's wrong, c'mon. (Pats his leg. She lies down and rests her
head in his lap)
Phoebe  It's, I mean, it's nothing, I'm fine. It's my friends. They-they have a
liking problem with you. In that, um, they don't.
Roger  Oh. They don't.
Phoebe  But they don't see all the wonderfulness that I see. They don't see all
the good stuff and all the sweet stuff. They just think you're a little...
Roger  What?
Phoebe  Intense and creepy.
Roger  Oh.
Phoebe  But I don't. Me, Phoebe.
Roger  Well, I'm not I'm not at all surprised they feel that way.
Phoebe  You're not? See, that's why you're so great!
Roger  Actually it's, it's quite, y'know, typical behaviour when you have this
kind of dysfunctional group dynamic. Y'know, this kind of co-dependant, emotionally
stunted, sitting in your stupid coffee house with your stupid big cups which, I'm sorry,
might as well have nipples on them, and you're like all 'Oh, define me! Define me! Love
me, I need love!'.
[Scene  Monica and Rachel's, Joey is letting everyone in on the new developments.]
Monica  So you talked to your dad, huh.
Joey  Yeah. He's gonna keep cheating on my ma like she wanted, she's gonna keep
pretending she doesn't know even though she does, and my little sister Tina can't see her
husband any more because he got a restraining order...which has nothing to do with
anything except that I found out today.
Rachel  Wow.
Chandler  Things sure have changed here on Waltons mountain.
Ross  So Joey, you okay?
Joey  Yeah, I guess. It's just parents, after a certain point, you gotta let go.
Even if you know better, you've gotta let them make their own mistakes.
Rachel  Just think, in a couple of years we get to turn into them.
Chandler  If I turn into my parents, I'll either be an alcoholic blond chasing
after twenty-year-old boys, or... I'll end up like my mom.
Phoebe  (entering) Hey.
All  Hey, Pheebs.
Monica  How's it going?
Phoebe  Oh, okay, except I broke up with Roger.
All  Awww.
Phoebe  Yeah, right.
All  Aaawwwwww!!
Rachel  What happened?
Phoebe  I don't know, I mean, he's a good person, and he can be really sweet,
and in some ways I think he is so right for me, it's just... I hate that guy!
[Scene  Monica and Rachel's. Phoebe is reading the paper and Joey enters.]
Phoebe  Hey, Joey. What's going on?
Monica  Joey!! What the hell were you doing?!
Joey  Sorry. Wrong boobies.
Monica  Hello, Joey.
Mr. Tribbiani  Oh! ...Hello, dear. (She whips the curtain shut in horror)
[Scene  Central Perk, Ross is eyeing a beautiful woman at the counter, and Joey and
Chandler are egging him on to go talk to her. No pun intended. I mean it.]
Joey  I'm tellin' you Ross, she wants you.
Ross  She barely knows me. We just live in the same building.
Chandler  Any contact?
Ross  She lent me an egg once.
Joey  You're in!
Ross  Aw, right.
Woman  Hi, Ross.
Ross  Hey. (stutters something incoherent)
Chandler  Come on, Ross, you gotta get back in the game here, ok? The Rachel
thing's not happening, your ex-wife is a lesbianI don't think we need a third...
Joey  Excuse me, could we get an egg over here, still in the shell? Thanks.
Ross  An egg?
Joey  Yeah, you're gonna go up to her and say, "Here's your egg back, I'm
returning your egg."
Chandler  I think it's winning.
Ross  I think it's insane.
Chandler  She'll love it. Go with the egg, my friend.
Joey  Think it'll work?
Chandler  No, it's suicide. The man's got an egg.
[Scene  Central Perk, Monica, Rachel, Phoebe, Joey, Chandler are there. Ross is still
talking to the beautiful woman.]
Monica  You can not do this.
Rachel  Do what, do what?
Monica  Roger wants to take her out tomorrow night.
Rachel  No! Phoebes! Don't you remember why you dumped the guy?
Phoebe  'Cause he was creepy, and mean, and a little frightening... alright,
still, it's nice to have a date on Valentine's Day!
Monica  But Phoebe, you can go out with a creepy guy any night of the year. I
know I do.
Rachel  Well, what are you guys doing tomorrow night?
Joey  Actually, tomorrow night kinda depends on how tonight goes.
Chandler  Oh, uh, listen, about tonight...
Joey  No, no, no, don't you dare bail on me. The only reason she's goin' out
with me is because I said I could bring a friend for her friend.
Chandler  Yes, I know, but her friend sounds like such a...
Joey  Pathetic mess? I know, butcome on, man, she's needy, she's
vulnerable. I'm thinkin', cha-ching! (Rachel throws a roll at Joey. He picks it up and
eats it.) Thanks. Look, you have not been out with a woman since Janice. You're doin'
this.
Ross  Hi. She said yes.
Chandler  Yes! Way to go, man! (Chandler and Ross hug. Something crunches in
Ross' shirt pocket.) Still got the egg, huh?
[Scene  A Restaurant, Joey and Chandler are there, waiting for their dates to show up.]
Joey  (Looking at himself in the reflection on a knife) How do I look?
Chandler  Oh, uh, I... don't... care. (Joey's date shows up) Ok, now, remember,
no trading. You get the pretty one, I get the mess.
Lorraine  Hi, Joey. Well well, look what you brought. Very nice.
Chandler  ...And what did you bring?
Lorraine  She's checking the coats. Joey, I'm gonna go wash the cab smell off my
hands. Will you get me a white Zinfandel, and a glass of red for Janice.
Chandler  Janice?
Janice  Oh.... my.... God.
Chandler  (angrily) Hey, it's Janice.
[Scene  The bathroom at the restaurant, Chandler and Joey are talking.]
Chandler  Ok, I'm makin' a break for it, I'm goin' out the window.
Joey  No, no, no, don't! I've been waitin' for like, forever to go out with
Lorraine. Just calm down.
Chandler  Calm down? Calm down? You set me up with the woman that I've dumped
twice in the last five months!
Joey  (at the urinal) Can you stop yellin'? You're makin' me nervous, and I
can't go when I'm nervous.
Chandler  I'm sorry, I'm sorry, you're right. (gets up right behind Joey and
yells in his ear) Come on, do it, do it, go, come on!!!
[Scene  Monica and Rachel's, the girls are all there, discussing their bad luck with
men.]
Rachel  Ok, ok, Roger was creepy, but he was nothing compared to Pete Carney.
Monica  Which one was Pete Carney?
Rachel  Pete the Weeper? Remember that guy who used to cry every time we had
sex. (imitating) "Was it good for you?"
Monica  Yeah, well, I'll take a little crying any day over
Howard-the-"I-win"-guy. (imitating) "I win! I win!" I went out with
the guy for two monthsI didn't get to win once.
Rachel  How did we end up with these jerks? We're good people!
Monica  I don't know. Maybe we're some kinda magnets.
Phoebe  I know I am. That's why I can't wear a digital watch.
Monica  There's more beer, right?
Phoebe  Oh! You know my friend Abby who shaves her head? She said that if you
want to break the bad boyfriend cycle, you can do like a cleansing ritual.
Rachel  Pheebes, this woman is voluntarily bald.
Phoebe  Yeah. So, we can do it tomorrow night, you guys. It's Valentine's Day.
It's perfect.
Monica  Ok, well, what kind of ritual?
Phoebe  Ok. We can, um, we can burn the stuff they gave us.
Rachel  Or?
Phoebe  Or...or we can chant and dance around naked, you know, with sticks.
Monica  Burning's good.
Rachel  Burning's good. Yeah, I got stuff to burn.
[Scene  The Restaurant, Joey, Lorraine, Chandler, and Janice are at the table. Joey and
Lorraine are seated very close, Chandler and Janice have backed their chairs away from one
another.]
Lorraine  You know, ever since I was little, I've been able to pick up quarters
with my toes.
Joey  Good for you. (jumps suddenly) Uh, quarters or rolls of quarters?
Janice  By the way, Chandler. I cut you out of all my pictures. So if you want,
I have a bag with just your heads.
Chandler  That's OK.
Janice  Oh, are you sure? Really? Because you know, you could make little
puppets out of them, and you could use them in your theater of cruelty.
Joey  (to Lorraine) We can't do that.
Chandler  (disgusted) What? What can't you do?
Joey  Uh, can I talk to you for a second, over there?
Joey  Uh, we might be leaving now.
Chandler  Tell me it's "you and me" we.
Joey  She said she wants to slather my body with stuff and then lick it off. I'm
not even sure what slathering is, but I definitely want to be a part of it.
Chandler  Ok, you can not do this to me.
Joey  You're right, I'm sorry. You're right.
Lorraine  (to waiter) Uh, can we have three chocolate mousses to go please?
Joey  I'm outta here. Here's my credit card. Dinner's on me. I'm sorry,
Chandler.
Chandler  I hope she throws up on you.
Chandler  So...
Janice  Just us.
Chandler  Oh, what a crappy night!
Janice  Although, I have enjoyed the fact that, uh your shirt's been stickin'
outta your zipper ever since you came back from the bathroom.
Chandler  Excuse me. (gets up, jumps up and down while he zips his zipper up...
other patrons look at him) How ya doin'?
Janice  So, do we have the best friends or what?
Chandler  Joey's not a friend. He's...a stupid man who left us his credit card.
Another drink? Some dessert? A big screen TV?
Janice  I will go for that drink.
Chandler  You got it. Good woman! (the waiter turns around, it's a man) Could we
get a bottle of your most overpriced champagne?
Janice  Each.
Chandler  That's right, each. Oh, and a uh Rob Roy. (to Janice) I've always
wanted to know...
[Scene  Chandler's bedroom, Chandler wakes up, and finds someone else's hand on his
chest. He rolls over and is shocked to see Janice there.]
Janice  Happy Valentine's Day!
[Scene  The Hallway, Chandler is trying to get Janice out of his apartment.]
Janice  Oh, I miss you already. Can you believe this happened?
Chandler  No... no! And yet it did. Good-bye, Janice.
Janice  Kiss me!
Monica  Oh, Chandler, sorry.
Monica  Ohhh, Chandler, sorry! Hey, Janice.
Janice  Hi, Monica.
Chandler  Ok, well, this was very special.
Monica  Rach, come see who's out here!
Rachel  Oh my god. Janice, hi!
Chandler  Janice is gonna go away now.
Monica  I'll be right back.
Rachel  Oh, Joey, look who it is.
Joey  (in disbelief) Whoa.
Chandler  Oh, good, Joey's home now.
Janice  This is so fun. This is like a reunion in the hall.
Monica  Oh, hi, Ross. Yeah. There's someone I want you to say hi to. (to
Chandler) He just happened to call.
Janice  Hi, Ross. Yes, it's me. How did you know? (she laughs obnoxiously)
[Scene  A Chinese Restaurant, Ross is there with his date.]
Ross  I'm just sayin' if dogs do experience jet lag, then, because of the whole
um, seven dog years to one human year thing, then, when a dog flies from New York to Los
Angeles, he doesn't just lose three hours, he loses like a week and a half.
Kristin  That's funny. Who are they?
Ross  The blond woman is my ex-wife, and the woman touching her is her... close,
personal friend.
Kristin  You mean they're lovers.
Ross  If you wanna put a label on it.
Kristin  Wow, uh, anything else I should know?
Ross  Nope, nope, that's it.
Ross  Oh, and she's pregnant with my baby. I always forget that part. (to Carol
and Susan) Helloo!
[Scene  Monica and Rachel's, the girls are holding their boyfriend bonfire.]
Phoebe  Ok, so now we need, um sage branches and the sacramental wine.
Monica  All I have is, is oregano and a Fresca.
Phoebe  Um, that's ok! (throws it in fire) Ok. All right. Now we need the semen
of a righteous man.
Rachel  Ok, Pheebs, you know what, if we had that, we wouldn't be doing the
ritual in the first place.
Monica  Can we just start throwing things in?
Phoebe  Ok, yeah, ok. (she throws the directions in) Oh, OK.
Rachel  (tossing things in the fire) Ok, Barry's letters. Adam Ritter's boxer
shorts.
Phoebe  Ok, and I have the, uh receipt for my dinner with Nokululu Oon Ah Ah.
Monica  Look, here's a picture of Scotty Jared naked.
Rachel  (looking at picture) Hey he's wearing a sweater.
Monica  No.
Rachel and Phoebe  Eww!
Rachel  And here we have the last of Paulo's grappa.
Monica  Hey, Rachel, isn't that stuff almost pure...
[Scene  Central Perk, Chandler and Joey are there. Chandler is preparing to dump Janice
again.]
Chandler  How can I dump this woman on Valentine's day?
Joey  I don't know. You dumped her on New Year's.
Chandler  Oh, man. In my next life, I'm coming back as a toilet brush.
Janice  Hello, funny Valentine.
Chandler  Hi, Just Janice.
Janice  Hello, Joey, our little matchmaker. I could just kiss you all over, and
I'm gonna!
Joey  (to Chandler) If you don't do it, I will.
[Scene  The Chinese Restaurant.]
Ross  So, um, what do you do for a living?
Kristin  Well, um, for the past few years I've been working..(Ross is watching
Carol and Susan, not listening to Kristin. Susan gets up, and has to go. Carol is left
stranded)...which is funny because, that wasn't even my major.
Carol  Oh no. I thought you said they could shoot the spot without you.
Susan  I thought they could...I'll try to get back as soon as I can. I'm sorry.
(Ross realizes Kristin was expecting him to laugh, so he starts to laugh hysterically.)
Ross  Now that is funny. Hey, do you think...would it be too weird if I invited
Carol over to join us? 'Cause she's, she's alone now, and pregnant, and, and sad.
Kristin  (reluctantly) I guess.
Ross  Are you sure? Great. Carol? Wanna come over and join us?
Carol  Oh, no no no. I'm fine. I'm fine.
Ross  Come on. These people'll scooch down. You guys'll scooch, won't you? Let's
try scooching! Come on. Come on. Uh, Kristen Riggs, this is Carol Willick. Carol, Kristin.
Uh, Carol teaches sixth grade. And, Kristin, Kristin...(struggling)...does something that,
funnily enough, wasn't even her major!
[Scene  Monica and Rachel's, firemen are there to handle the bonfire that got out of
control.]
Fireman No. 1  What do we got there?
Monica  You know, it's a really funny story how this happened.
Fireman No. 3  It's all right. It's all right. You don't have to explain. This
isn't the first boyfriend bonfire that we've seen get out of control.
Fireman No. 1  You're our third call tonight.
Rachel  Really?
Fireman No. 2  Oh, sure, Valentine's is our busiest night of the year.
[Scene  Central Perk.]
Janice  I brought you something.
Chandler  Is it loaded? Oh, little candy hearts. (reading the candy) Chan and
Jan Forever.
Janice  I had them made special.
Chandler  Ok, Janice. Janice. Hey, Janice. Look, there's no way for me to tell
you this. At least there's no new way for me to tell you this. I just don't things
are gonna work out.
Janice  That's fine.
Chandler  (surprised) It is?
Janice  Mmm-hmm. Because I know that this isn't the end.
Chandler  Oh no, you see, actually it is.
Janice  No, it isn't, because you won't let that happen. Don't you know it yet?
You love me, Chandler Bing.
Chandler  Oh, no I don't.
Janice  Well then ask yourself this. Why do you think we keep ending up
together? New Year's? Who invited who? Valentine's? Who asked who into whose bed?
Chandler  I did, but...
Janice  You seek me out. Something deep in your soul calls out to me like a
foghorn. Janice, Janice. You want me. You need me. You can't live without me. And you know
it. You just don't know you know it. See ya.
Chandler  Call me!
[Scene  The Chinese Restaurant, Ross and Carol are talking. Kristin is not there.]
Carol  It's not true. I never called your mother a wolverine.
Ross  You did so. I swear, I swear(noticing Kristin's absence) How long
has she been in the bathroom?
Carol  Uh, I don't think she's in the bathroom. Her coat is gone.
Ross  Well maybe it's cold in there. Or maybe I screwed up the first date I had
in 9 years.
Carol  That could be it.
Ross  Oh, god. (He puts his head down on the grill) You know, this is still
pretty hot. (He picks his head up, and a mushroom sticks to his head. Carol picks it off
and eats it.)
Carol  Mushroom. Smile. They won't all be like this. Some women might even stay
through dinner. Sorry, that's not funny
Ross  No, it's just...you know the whole "getting on with your life"
thing. Well, do I have to? I mean, I'm sitting here with this cute woman, and, and, and
she's perfectly nice, and, but that there's, that's it. And um, and then I'm here talkin'
to you, and, and it's easy, and it's fun, and, and I don't, I don't have to...You know,
here's a wacky thought. Um, what's say you and I give it another shot? No no no, I know
what you're gonna say, you're a lesbian. But what do you say we just put that aside for
now you know? Let's just stick a pin in it, ok? Because, we're great together, you know.
You can't deny it. Besides, you're carrying my baby. I mean, how perfect is that? But see,
you know, you keep sayin' that, but there's somethin' right here. I love you.
Carol  Oh, I love you too. But...
Ross  No but, no but.
Carol  You know that thing you put over here with the pin in it? It's time to
take the pin out. You'll find someone, I know you will. The right woman is just waiting
for you.
Ross  That's easy for you to say, you found one already.
Carol  All you need is a woman who likes men and you'll be set.
Carol  Not her.
[Scene  Monica and Rachel's, The girls are talking with the firemen.]
Fireman No. 3  We get off around midnight, why don't we pick you up then?
Rachel  So, um, will you bring the truck?
Fireman No. 3  I'll even let you ring the bell.
Rachel  Oh, my god.
Phoebe  See, there you go, the cleansing works!
Monica  They're nice guys.
Rachel  Oh, they're firemen guys.
[Scene  Out in the hall, the firemen are talking.]
Fireman No. 1  You guys tell them you were married?
Fireman No. 2  No way!
Fireman No. 3  Are you kidding? My girlfriend doesn't know, I'm not gonna tell
them!
[Scene  Central Perk, Rachel is serving Joey, Ross, and Monica their drinks.]
Rachel  (to Joey) Coffee. (Hands it to him.)
Joey  Thank you.
Rachel  (to Ross) Cappuccino. (Hands it to him.)
Ross  Grazie.
Rachel  And a nice hot cider for Monica. (Hands it to her.)
Monica  Aww, thank you. (Notices something.) Uh Rach?
Rachel  Yeah?
Monica  Why does my cinamon stick have an eraser?
Rachel  Oh! That's why. (Rachel checks behind her ear, and finds a cinamon
stick.) I'm sorry!
[Scene  Chandler's job, Chandler is typing data into his computer, he keeps typing even
while taking a drink of coffee with one hand. One of his co-workers walks by.]
Woman  Chandler.
Chandler  Mrs. Tedlock. You're looking lovely today. And may I say, that is a very
flattering sleeve length on you.
Mrs. Tedlock  Yes. Well, Mr. Kostelick wants you to stop by his office at the
end of the day.
Chandler  Oh, listen. If this is about those prank memos, I had nothing to do
with them. Really. Nothing at all. Really. (Chandler tries to hide a rubber chicken from
the woman.) Nothing.
[Scene  Central Perk, everyone is there but Chandler. Phoebe runs in, excitedly.]
Phoebe  Hey you guys! Chandler's coming and he says he has, like, this
incredible news, so when he gets here, we could all act like, you know...
Chandler  Hey!
All  Hey!
Phoebe  Never mind. But it was going to be really good.
Ross  What's going on?
All  What is it?
Chandler  So, it's a typical day at work. I'm inputting my numbers, and big Al
calls me into his office and tells me he wants to make me processing supervisor.
All  That's great!
Chandler  So.... I quit.
All  Why?
Chandler  Why? This was supposed to be a temp job!
Monica  Yeah, Chandler... you've been there for five years.
Chandler  If I took this promotion, it'd be like admitting that this is what I
actually do.
Phoebe  So was it a lot more money?
Chandler  It doesn't matter. I just don't want to be one of those guys that's in
his office until twelve o'clock at night worrying about the WENUS.
Rachel  ... the WENUS?
Chandler  Weekly Estimated Net Usage Systems. A processing term.
Rachel  (sarcastic) Oh. That WENUS.
Joey  So what're you going to do?
Chandler  I don't know. That's the thing. I don't know what I want to do. I just
know I'm not going to figure it out working there.
Phoebe  Oooh! I have something you can do! I have this new massage client...
Steve? (pause) Anyway, he's opening up a restaurant and he's looking for a head chef.
Monica  (taps Phoebe on her shoulder) Um... hi there.
Phoebe  Hi! (turns back to Chandler, then to Monica) Oh, yeah, no, I know.
You're a chef. I know, and I thought of you first, but um, Chandler's the one who needs a
job right now, so....
Chandler  Yeah... I just don't have that much cheffing experience. Unless it's
an all-toast restaurant.
Phoebe  (to Monica's tapping) Yeah, yeah!
Monica  Well, what kind of food is he looking for?
Phoebe  Well, he wants to do some ecclectic, so he's looking for someone who
can, you know, create the entire menu.
Monica  (excited) Oh my God!
Phoebe  Yeah, I know! (turns to Chandler) So, what do you think?
Chandler  Thanks, Phoebe. But I just don't really see myself in a big white hat.
Phoebe  OK. (pause) Oh Monica! Guess what!
[Scene  Monica and Rachel's, Chandler walks in, wearing a suit.]
Chandler  Can you see my nipples through this shirt?
Rachel  No. But don't worry, I'm sure they're still there.
Phoebe  Where are you going, Mr. Suity-Man?
Chandler  Well, I have an appointment to see Dr. Robert Pillman, career
counselor a-gogo. (pause) I added the "a-gogo."
Rachel  Career counselor?
Chandler  Hey, you guys all know what you want to do.
Rachel  I don't!
Chandler  Hey, you guys in the living room all know what you want to do.
You know, you have goals. You have dreams. I don't have a dream.
Ross  Ah, the lesser-known "I don't have a dream" speech.
Monica  Oh, I love my life, I love my life!
Phoebe  Ooh! Brian's Song!
Rachel  The meeting with the guy went great?
Monica  So great! He showed me where the restaurant's going to be. It's this,
it's this cute little place on 10th Street. Not too big, not too small. Just right.
Chandler  Was it formerly owned by a blonde woman and some bears?
Monica  So anyway, I'm cooking dinner for him Monday night. You know, kind of
like an audition. And Phoebe, he really wants you to be here, which will be great for me
because then you can 'ooh' and 'ahh' and make yummy noises.
Rachel  What are you going to make?
Phoebe  (as though Rachel wasn't paying attention) Yummy noises.
Rachel  (pause) And Monica, what are you going to make?
Monica  I don't know. I don't know. It's just going to be so great!
Phoebe  Ooh! I know what you could make! (runs over to join Monica and Rachel in
the kitchen) I know! Oh, you should definitely make that thing... you know, with the
stuff? (Monica doesn't know.) You know, that thing... with the stuff...? OK, I don't know.
(sits down)
Ross  Hey guys, does anybody know a good date place in the neighborhood?
Joey  How about Tony's? If you can finish a 32-ounce steak, it's free.
Ross  OK, ahem, hey, does anybody know a good place if you're not dating a puma?
Chandler  Who are you going out with?
Phoebe  Oh, is this the bug lady?
Rachel  (trying to sound like a bug) Bzzzz.... I love you, Ross.
Ross  Her name is Celia. She's not a bug lady. She's curator of insects at the
museum.
Rachel  So what are you guys going to do?
Ross  Oh, I just thought we could go out to dinner, and then maybe bring her
back to my place and I'd introduce her to my monkey.
Chandler  And he's not speaking metaphorically.
Joey  (aside to Ross) So.... back to your place...you thinking, maybe...
(gestures with hands, back and forth) huh-huh?
Ross  Well, I don't know.... (gestures) huh-huh.... but I'm hoping (gestures)
huh-huh.
Joey  I'm telling you, that monkey is a chick magnet! She's going to take one
look at his furry, cute little face and it'll seal the deal.
[Scene  Ross's apartment, Marcel is hanging from Celia's hair, and she is screaming,
trying to get him off.]
Ross  Celia, don't worry!  Don't scream!  He's not going to hurt you!
Soothing tones, Celia. Soothing tones! Marcel...
Celia  I can't stand this! He's got his claws in my...
Ross  Alright... (lifts Marcel away)
[Scene  Monica and Rachel's, everyone is there but Ross and Chandler. Monica is making
food, and having everyone try it.]
Monica  (to Joey) OK, try this salmon mousse.
Joey  (tasting) Mmmm. Good.
Monica  Is it better than the other salmon mousse?
Joey  It's creamier.
Monica  Yeah, well, is that better?
Joey  I don't know. We're talking about whipped fish, Monica. I'm just happy I'm
keeping it down, y'know?
Rachel  My God! What happened to you?
Chandler  Eight and a half hours of aptitude tests, intelligence tests,
personality tests... and what do I learn? (he taps the results and reads them) "You
are ideally suited for a career in data processing for a large multinational
corporation."
Phoebe  That's so great! 'Cause you already know how to do that!
Chandler  Can you believe it? I mean, don't I seem like somebody who should be
doing something really cool? You know, I just always pictured myself doing
something...something.
Rachel  (comes up and rubs him on the chest) Oh Chandler, I know, I know... oh,
hey! You can see your nipples through this shirt!
Monica  (brings a plate of tiny appetizers over) Here you go, maybe this'll
cheer you up.
Chandler  Ooh, you know, I had a grape about five hours ago, so I'd better split
this with you.
Monica  It's supposed to be that small. It's a pre-appetizer. The French call it
an amouz-bouche.
Chandler  (tastes it) Well.... it is amouz-ing...
Monica  (on phone) Hello? (Listens) Oh, hi Wendy! (Listens) Yeah, eight o'clock.
(Listens) What did we say? Ten dollars an hour?... (Listens) OK, great. (Listens) All
right, I'll see you then. Bye. (hangs up)
Phoebe  Ten dollars an hour for what?
Monica  Oh, I asked one of the waitresses at work if she'd help me out.
Rachel  (hurt) Waitressing?
Joey  Uh-oh.
Monica  Well... of course I thought of you! But... but...
Rachel  But, but?
Monica  But, you see, it's just... this night has to go just perfect, you know?
And, well, Wendy's more of a... professional waitress.
Rachel  Oh! I see. And I've sort of been maintaining my amateur status so that I
can waitress in the Olympics.
Chandler  You know, I don't mean to brag, but I waited tables at Innsbruck in
'76. (dead silence) Amouz-bouche? (holds out tray)
[Scene  Ross' apartment, Girl, You'll Be A Woman Soon (the original, not that
cruddy Urge Overkill version) is playing. Ross and Celia are kissing passionately.]
Celia  Talk to me.
Ross  OK.... um, a weird thing happened to me on the train this morning...
Celia  No no no. Talk... dirty.
Ross  (embarrassed) Wha... what, here?
Celia  Yes...
Ross  Ah....
Celia  Say something..... hot.
Ross  (panicked) Er.... um.....
Celia  What?
Ross  Um... uh.... vulva.
[Scene  Chandler and Joey's, Joey and Ross are there, discussing what happened last
night.]
Joey  (in disbelief) Vulva?
Ross  Alright, I panicked, alright? She took me by surprise. You know, but it
wasn't a total loss. I mean, we ended up cuddling.
Joey  (sarcastic) Whoaa!! You cuddled? How many times??
Ross  Shut up! It was nice. I just... I don't think I'm the dirty-talking kind
of guy, you know?
Joey  What's the big deal? You just say what you want to do to her. Or what you
want her to do to you. Or what you think other people might be doing to each other. I'll
tell you what. Just try something on me.
Ross  (deadpan) Please be kidding.
Joey  Why not? Come on! Just, just close your eyes and tell me what you'd like
to be doing right now.
Ross  OK. (closes eyes) I'm in my apartment...
Joey  ....yeah... what else?
Ross  That's it. I'm in my apartment, you're not there, we're not having this
conversation. (gets up, walks across room)
Joey  (walks to catch up to him) Alright, look, I'll start, OK?
Ross  Joey, please.
Joey  Come on. Come on. Alright, ready, look! (in a low voice) Oh... Ross....
you get me so hot. I want your lips on me now.
Ross  (impressed) Wow.
Joey  Alright, now you say something.
Ross  I... ahem... I really don't think so.
Joey  Come on! You like this woman, right?
Ross  Yeah.
Joey  You want to see her again, right?
Ross  Sure.
Joey  Well if you can't talk dirty to me, how're you going to talk dirty to her?
Now tell me you want to caress my butt!
Ross  OK, turn around. (Joey looks taken aback) I just don't want you staring at
me when I'm doing this.
Joey  (turning around) Alright, alright. I'm around. Go ahead.
Ross  Ahem... I want.... OK, I want to... feel your... hot, soft skin with my
lips.
Joey  There you go! Keep going. Keep going!
Ross  I, er...
Ross  I want to take my tongue... and...
Ross  ....and....
Joey  Say it... say it!
Ross  ...run it all over your body until you're... trembling with... with...
Chandler  (smiling)....with??
Ross  (rushing to explain) Funny story!
Joey  You're not going to believe this!
Chandler  It's OK. It's OK. I was always rooting for you two kids to get
together.
Joey  Hey Chandler, while you were sleeping that guy from your old job called
again.
Chandler  Again?
Joey  And again, and again, and again... (phone rings, he answers) Hello? (hands
phone to Chandler) And again.
Chandler  (on phone) Hey Mr. Kostelic! How's life on the fifteenth floor?
(Listens) Yeah, I miss you too. (Listens) Yeah, it's a lot less satisfying to steal pens
from your own home, you know? (Listens) Well, that's very generous (Listens) er, but look,
this isn't about the money. I need something that's more than a job. I need something I
can really care about.... (Listens) And that's on top of the yearly bonus structure you
mentioned earlier? (Listens) Look, Al, Al... I'm not playing hardball here, OK? This is
not a negotiation, this is a rejection! (Listens) No! No! No, stop saying numbers! I'm
telling you, you've got the wrong guy! You've got the wrong guy! (Listens) I'll see you on
Monday! (slams the phone down)
[Scene  Chandler's new window office, he is showing Phoebe around.]
Chandler  Well?
Phoebe  (excited) Wow! It's huge! It's so much bigger than the cubicle. Oh, this
is a cube.
Chandler  Look at this! (he opens the curtain to a view of New York City)
Phoebe  Oh! You have a window!
Chandler  Yes indeedy! (they look outside) With a beautiful view of...
Phoebe  Oh look! That guy's peeing!
Chandler  (walks away from window) OK, that's enough of the view. Check this
out, look at this. Sit down, sit down.
Phoebe  (sitting) OK.
Chandler  This is great! (he presses a button on his intercom) Helen, could you
come in here for a moment?
Chandler  Thank you Helen, that'll be all.
Chandler  Last time I do that, I promise.
[Scene  Monica and Rachel's, Monica is on the phone. Rachel walks in and overhears the
conversation.]
Monica  (shouting on phone) Wendy, we had a deal! (Listens) Yeah, you promised!
Wendy! Wendy! Wendy! (hangs up)
Rachel  Who was that?
Monica  Wendy bailed. I have no waitress.
Rachel  Oh... that's too bad. Bye bye. (she walks away towards the door)
Monica  Ten dollars an hour.
Rachel  No.
Monica  Twelve dollars an hour.
Rachel  Mon. I wish I could, but I've made plans to walk around.
Monica  You know, Rachel, when you ran out of your wedding, I was there for you.
I put a roof over your head, and if that means nothing to you... (Rachel isn't buying it,
desperate) twenty dollars an hour.
Rachel  Done.
[Scene  Monica and Rachel's, later. Rachel is waitressing, Monica is cooking. Phoebe
walks in with Steve (Crystal Duck winner Jon Lovitz).]
Rachel  Well hello! Welcome to Monica's. May I take your coat?
Monica  Hi Steve!
Steve  Hello, Monica. (to Rachel) Hello, greeter girl.
Monica  (to Steve) This is Rachel.
Steve  (unconcerned) Yeah, OK.
Phoebe  (overemphasizing) Mmmmmm! Everything smells so delicious! You know, I
can't remember a time I smelt such a delicious combination of (Monica signals her to stop)
of, OK, smells.
Steve  It's a lovely apartment.
Monica  Oh, thank you. Would you like a tour?
Steve  I was just being polite, but, alright.
Rachel  What's up?
Phoebe  (whispers) In the cab, on the way over, Steve blazed up a doobie.
Rachel  What?
Phoebe  Smoked a joint? You know, lit a bone? Weed? Hemp? Ganja?
Rachel  OK, OK. I'm with you, Cheech. OK.
Steve  (from the living room) Is it dry in here? (licks his lips)
Rachel  Let me, let me get you some wine!
Monica  Yeah, I think we're ready for our first course. (Steve sits, Monica
brings over a tray) OK, um, these are rot-shrimp ravioli, and celantro pondou sauce...
(Steve starts to eat them one by one, quickly)... with just a touch of mints... and... (he
finishes)... ginger.
Steve  Well, smack my ass and call me Judy! These are fantastic!
Monica  I'm so glad you liked them!
Steve  Like 'em? I could eat a hundred of them!
Monica  Oh, well... um, that's all there are of these. But in about eight and a
half minutes, we'll be serving some delicious onion tartlets.
Steve  Tartlets. Tartlets. Tartlets. The word has lost all meaning. (he gets up
and goes into the kitchen)
Rachel  Excuse me? Can I help you with anything?
Steve  You know, I don't know what I'm looking for.
Steve  (from kitchen) Ah, cool! Taco shells! (Rachel motions, "You
see!") You know, these are... they're like a little corn envelope.
Monica  (joining him and taking the taco shells) You know that? You don't want
to spoil your appetite.
Steve  (looking in cabinets) Hey! Sugar-O's! (grabs the cereal box)
Monica  You know, if you just wait another... six and a half minutes...
Steve  Macaroni and cheese! We gotta make this!
Monica  No, we don't. (reaches for box)
Steve  Oh, OK. (he drops the box on the floor) Oh, sorry. (When she bends down
to pick it up he grabs a package of Gummi-bears from the cabinet.)
Monica  Why don't you just have a seat here? (he sits at the table, then tries
to secretly eat the Gummi-bears. Monica spots him.) OK... give me the Gummi-bears.
Steve  (childishly) No.
Monica  Give them to me.
Steve  Alright, we'll share.
Monica  No, give me the...
Steve  Well then you can't have any. (she grabs for the package, and it breaks
open. Gummi-bears fly everywhere, some into the punch bowl on the table.) Bear overboard!
I think he's drowning. (he throws some Sugar-O's into the punch bowl) Hey fellows! Grab on
a Sugar-O... save yourself! (Mimicking the bears) "Help!  I'm drowning!  
Help!"
Monica  (furious) That's it! Dinner is over!
Steve  What?
Monica  What?
Steve  Why?
Monica  Why? It's just that I've waited seven years for an opportunity like
this, and you can't even wait four and a half minutes for a stupid onion tartlet?
Steve  (excited) Hey!
[Scene  Central Perk, all are there except Chandler.]
Joey  What a tool!
Rachel  You don't want to work for a guy like that.
Ross  Yeah!
Monica  I know... it's just... I thought this was, you know... it.
Ross  Look, you'll get there. You're an amazing chef.
Phoebe  Yeah! You know all those yummy noises? I wasn't faking.
Joey  (to Ross) So, er... how did it go with Celia?
Ross  Oh, I was unbelievable.
Joey  All right, Ross!
Ross  I was the James Michener of dirty talk. It was the most elaborate filth
you have ever heard. I mean, there were characters, plot lines, themes, a motif...
at one point there were villagers.
Joey  Whoa! And the... (gestures with hands) huh-huh?
Ross  Well, ahem... you know, by the time we'd finished with all the dirty talk,
it was kinda late... and we were both kind of exhausted, so uh...
Joey  You cuddled.
Ross  Yeah, which was nice.
Phoebe  You guys wanna try and catch a late movie or something?
Rachel  Maybe, but shouldn't we wait for Chandler?
Joey  Yeah, where the hell is he?
[Scene  Chandler's office, he's on the phone, agitated.]
Chandler  (on phone) Yes, Fran. I know what time it is, but I'm looking at the
WENUS and I'm not happy!... (Listens) Oh, really, really, really? Well, let me tell you
something... you will care about it, because I care about it! You got it? Good! (slams
phone down, then leans back and realizes what just happened) Whooooaaaa....
[Scene  Phoebe's massage parlour, she has Steve on the table, and is giving him an
extra-painful massage.]
Phoebe  How's this? (presses down hard)
Steve  Eeeee!
Phoebe  Sorry. How about over here? (presses down hard again)
Steve  Aaaaah!
Phoebe  See, that just means it's working. Does this hurt? (presses down
elsewhere)
Steve  No.
Phoebe  What about this? (she starts using her elbows on his back, he yells in
pain)
Steve  Aaaaahhh!!
Phoebe  There you go! (She continues to work him over
with her elbows and he continues to yell in pain.)

Rachel  (Like a big baby) Um... unless, unless I use yours.
Monica  Hah, no no no no no no no no no no.
Rachel  (Tapping the clipboard) well, now, wait a second, who did I just put as
my "In case of emergency" person?
Monica  (Looking around to check that no-one's listening, then lowering her
voice anyway) That's insurance fraud.

home. Ow ow ow ow!

[Scene  Central Perk, Chandler, has split up his newspaper so Joey can look at the

Ross  I had a dream last night where I was playing football with my kid.
Chandler and Joey  That's nice.
Ross  No, no, with him. (He mimes holding the baby like a football.) I'm
on this field, and they, they hike me the baby... and I, I know I've gotta do
something 'cause the Tampa Bay defence is comin' right at me.
Joey  Tampa Bay's got a terrible team.
Ross  Right, but, it is just me and the baby, so I'm thinkin' they can take us.
And so I uh, hah-hah, I just heave it down field.
Chandler  What are you crazy? That's a baby!
Joey  He should take the sack?
Ross  Anyway, suddenly I'm down field, and I realise that I'm the one
who's supposed to catch him, right? Only I know there is no way I'm gonna get there in
time, so I am running, and running, and that, that is when I woke up. See I, I am so
not ready to be a father.
Chandler  Hey, you're gonna be fine. You're one of the most caring, most
responsible men in North America. You're gonna make a great dad.
Joey  Yeah, Ross. You and the baby just need better blocking.
Joey  Oh, have either one of you guys ever been to the Rainbow Room? Is it real
expensive?
Chandler  Well, only if you order stuff.
Joey  I'm takin' Ursula tonight. It's her birthday.
Ross  Wo-wo-whoa. What about Phoebe's birthday?
Joey  When's that?
Ross  Tonight.
Joey  Oh, man. What're the odds of that happening?
Ross  You take your time.
Chandler  There it is! So what're you gonna do?
Joey  What can I do? Look, I don't want to do anything to screw it up with
Ursula.
Chandler  And your friend Phoebe?
Joey  Well, if she's my friend, hopefully she'll understand. I mean, wouldn't
you guys?
Chandler  Man, if you tried something like that on my birthday, you'd be
starin' at the business end of a hissy fit.
[Scene  The Hospital, Monica and Rachel are waiting for the doctors to arrive.

Monica  Yes? (jumping as Rachel punches her arm) ..yes, she is.
Rachel (as Monica)  Hi, this is my friend Rachel.
Monica (as Rachel)  Hi.
Dr. Mitchell  (Smiling) Hi, err Rachel. I'm Dr.Mitchell.
Dr. Rosen  (Smiling even more and attempting to take over) And I'm his friend,
Dr.Rosen.
Rachel  Aren't you a little cute to be a doctor?
Dr. Rosen  Excuse me?

young to be a doctor. Oh good, Rach.

surprise birthday party.  Rachel and Monica is telling Chandler about Rachel's
incident.]
Rachel  ..so, he said it was just a sprain, and that was it.
Monica  Uh, you left out the stupid part.
Rachel  Not stupid. The very cute, cute, cute doctors asked us out for tomorrow
night, and I said "yes."
Monica  I think it's totally insane, I mean, they work for the hospital. It's
like returning to the scene of the crime. You know, I say we blow off the dates.
Rachel  What? Monica, they are cute, they are doctors, (spelling it out in the
air for her slow friend) cute doctors, doctors who are cute!
Chandler  Alright, what have we learned so far?
The Whole Party  (Jumping up) SURPRISE!!!
Ross  What the hell are you doing? You scared the crap outta me.
Rachel  Was that the cake?
Ross  Yeah, yeah. I got a lemon schmush.
Monica  Come on, she'll be here any minute.
Rachel  I hope it's okay.
Monica  Oh...
Chandler  (Reading) "Happy Birthday Peehe."
Monica  Well maybe we can make a, a, a 'B' out of one of those roses.

Ross  Oh, we just...
Phoebe's Friends  (Finally noticing the guest of honour) Surprise!

scary. Hi everybody. Hi Betty! Betty, Hi! (Thrilled) You found Betty! Oh my god! (Hugging
people) This is great. Everybody I love is in the same room, (still happy) Where's Joey?
Chandler  Did you see Betty?
[Scene  A Restaurant, Ross is having lunch with his father who is examining his next
forkful.]
Mr. Geller  I tell you one thing, I wouldn't mind having a piece of
this sun-dried tomato business. Five years ago, if somebody had said to me, here's a
tomato that looks like a prune, I'd say "get out of my office!"
Ross  Dad, before I was born, did you freak out at all?
Mr. Geller  I'm not freaking out, I'm just saying, if somebody had
come to me with the idea andndash;
Ross  Dad, dad, dad, I'm talkin' about the whole uh, baby thing. Did you uh,
ever get this sort of... panicky, "Oh my god I'm gonna be a father" kind of a
thing?
Mr. Geller  No. Your mother really did the work. I was busy with the
business. I wasn't around that much. Is that what this is about?
Ross  No, no, Dad, I was just wondering.
Mr. Geller  'Cause there's time to make up for that. We can do stuff
together. You always wanted to go to that Colonial Williamsburg. How 'bout we do that?
Ross  Thanks, Dad, really, I ju... you know, I just, I just needed to know,
um... when did you start to feel like a father?
Mr. Geller  Oh, well, I, I guess it musta been the day after you were
born. We were in the hospital room, your mother was asleep, and they brought you in and
gave you to me. You were this ugly little red thing, and all of a sudden you grabbed my
finger with your whole fist. And you squeezed it, so tight. And that's when I knew.
Mr. Geller  So you don't wanna go to Williamsburg?
Ross  No, we can go to Williamsburg.
Mr. Geller  Eat your fish.
[Scene  Monica and Rachel's, Monica is just getting off of the intercom and turns off
the TV which is still in the SAP mode.]
Monica  Rachel, the cute doctors are here.
Rachel  (entering from her room) Okay, coming!
Monica  Hi, come on in.
Dr. Mitchell  Hey.
Monica  Hi, Geoffrey.
Rachel  Hi.
Dr. Rosen  Ah here, we brought wine.
Dr. Mitchell  Look at this, it's from the cellars of Ernest and Tova Borgnine,
so how could we resist?
Rachel  Oh, that's great. Look at that.
Dr. Rosen  So, Monica, how's the ankle?
Monica  It's uh...
Monica (as Rachel)  ..well, why don't you tell them? After all it, is
your ankle.
Rachel (as Monica)  You know what, it's feeling a lot better, thank you, um...
Well, listen, why don't you two sit down and, and we'll get you some glasses... okay...
(They don't know what to do with their coats and Monica points to the living room) STAT!
Rachel  Okay, listen, I'm thinking, why don't we just tell them who we really
are? I mean, it'll be fine, I really think it'll be fine.
Monica  It will not be fine. We'll get in trouble.
Rachel  Oh, Monica! Would you stop being such a wuss?
Monica  A wuss? Excuse me for living in the real world, okay?
Dr. Mitchell  So?
Dr. Rosen  So... they sss-still seem normal.
Dr. Mitchell  That's because they are.
Dr. Rosen  (Nervously) okay, but you have to admit that every time we go out...
Women we meet at the hospital... It turns into...
Dr. Mitchell  Willya relax? Look around. No pagan altars, no piles of bones in
the corners, they're fine. (Baring his teeth to clean them with his finger) Go like this.
(Dr. Rosen obeys.)
Monica  I said we are not going to do it, okay? Sometimes you can be such a, a
big baby.
Rachel  (Resenting the truth) I am not a baby! You know what? I swear to
god, just because you get so uptight every time we...
Monica  Sure, every time, you're such a princess...
Rachel  You know what?
Monica  What?
Rachel  You know what?
Monica  What!?
Rachel  You know what?
Monica  (getting angry) What!!?
Rachel  Every day, you are becoming more and more like your mother.
Rachel  Hello! Here we go!
Dr. Rosen  This is a great place. How long have you lived here?
Rachel  (as Monica) Thanks! I've been here about six years, and Rachel moved in
a few months ago.
Monica  (as Rachel) Yeah... (joining the others) ..see, I was supposed to get
married, but, um, I left the guy at the altar.
Dr. Mitchell  Really?
Monica  (as Rachel) Yeah... Yeah, I know it's pretty selfish, but haha, hey,
that's me. (Indicating a dish on the table) Why don't you try the hummus?
Dr. Rosen  So, Monica, what do you do?
Rachel  (as Monica) Aahh, I'm a... chef at a restaurant uptown.
Dr. Rosen  Good for you.
Rachel  (as Monica) Yeah it is, mostly because I get to boss people
around, which I just love to do.
Dr. Rosen  This hummus is great.
Dr. Mitchell  God bless the chickpea.
Monica  (as Rachel) (Suddenly laughing) Oh, god, I am so spoiled... That's it!
Rachel  (as Monica) And by the way, have I mentioned that back in high school, I
was a cow?
Monica  (as Rachel) I used to wet my bed.
Rachel  (as Monica) I use my breasts to get other people's attention.
Monica  (as Rachel) (Revealing her anger to point at her best friend) We both
do that!
Dr. Mitchell  (on the phone) Monica and Rachel's apartment. Err yeh, aayah, yeh,
just one second... (handing it to Monica) ..ah, Rachel, it's your dad.
Monica  (as Rachel) Hi, Dad. No, no, it's me. (Getting up to move further away
from Rachel) li-listen, Dad, I can't talk right now, um, but there's something, um...
there's something that I've been meaning to tell you...
Rachel  Would you excuse me for a second?
Monica  (as Rachel) Remember back in freshman year? (Talking fast before Rachel
can catch her) Well, Billy Dreskin and I had sex on your bed.
[Scene  Monica and Rachel's, the next morning, Ross, Phoebe, Chandler and Monica sit
round the coffee table, playing Scrabble. Rachel, still in her dressing gown, is pleading
on the phone, her free hand shaking with agitation.]
Rachel  (on phone) Daddy... Daddy... Daddy, why whyyy would I sleep with Billy
Dreskin? His father tried to put you out of business! (Rachel turns to Monica, clasping
the receiver to her bosom so Dr.Green can't hear, while mouthing "You are...")
...dead!
Monica  Ross, he's got the remote again.
Ross  Good. Maybe he can switch it back.
Ross  Maybe not.
Rachel  Hello? (Listens) Um, yeah, uh, (snapping her fingers at Ross who takes
the remote from Marcel, then turns off the TV) Okay ah, hold on a second, lemme lemme just
check and see if see if she's here.
Rachel  It's the woman from the hospital admissions office. She says there's a
problem with the form. Oh, god, oh god...
Rachel and Monica  Oh god, waddawe do, waddawe do, waddawe do?
Monica  I don't know! Why don't you just explain? What do they want? Find out
what they want!
Rachel  Okay (desperately hands the receiver over) no, you do it.
Monica  (taking the phone) Hello, this is Monica... Yeah??? Oh... (Smiles at
Rachel to reassure her) Okay, yes, we'll be right, we'll be right down.(Listens) Thank
you. (Hangs up)
Rachel  What?
Monica  We forgot to sign one of the admissions forms.
Rachel  Ohhh... (slumping in relief) Okay, you were right. You were right! This
was just not worth it.
Monica  Thank you.
Rachel  Okay, let me just change.
Monica  Yes.
Joey  (entering quietly) Hey.
Ross and Chandler  Hey!
Monica  Hi.
Phoebe  Trouble?
Joey  Your sister stood me up the other night.
Phoebe  Oh, no. Don't you hate it when people aren't there for
you?
Ross  Well did you try calling her?
Joey  I've been trying for two days. When I called the restaurant, they said she
was too busy to talk. I can't believe she's blowin' me off.
[Scene  Riff's, Phoebe is entering. Ursula returns with two plates of chicken, but she
only has time to set one on the table, when...]

Ursula  Right.
Ursula  Excuse me. Doesn't this come with a side salad?
Phoebe  So, um, are you gonna call him?
Ursula  What? (Indicating the departing waiter) Do you think he likes me?
Phoebe  No, Joey.
Ursula  Oh. No, no, he is so smart. He'll figure it out. (Offering to share her
food) Do you want some chicken?
Phoebe  No. No food with a face.
Ursula  You have not changed!
Phoebe  Yeah, you too.
[Scene  The Emergency Room. The officious admissions nurse is again on duty. Rachel and
Monica enter, looking worried. As they approach the desk, Rachel adopts a winning smile,
while Monica struggles to smile at all.]
Rachel  (as Monica) Hi, remember us?
Nurse  (Grimacing) Mmm hmmm.
Monica  (as Rachel) Um, okay. You just called a little while ago about needing a
signature on the admissions form. Well, it turns out we need a whole new one
(little laugh) because uh, you see, I-I, I put the wrong name again. (Little laugh) 'cause
um...
Nurse  You're that stupid.
Monica  (as Rachel) I am. I'm that stupid. (Little laugh.)
Rachel  (as Monica) Yeah, and and, I'm just gonna pay for this with a check.
Nurse  Well, you know your insurance will cover that.
Rachel  (as Monica) Yeah, I know... (mirroring her friend) ..I'm I'm just not
that bright either.
[Scene  Monica and Rachel's, Chandler is neglecting the game of Scrabble, for
he's busily drawing on his own childhood in an attempt to help Ross. Marcel chitters
about.]
Chandler  Okay, worst case scenario. Say you never feel like a father.
Ross  Uh-huh.
Chandler  Say your son never feels connected to you, as one. Say all of his
relationships are affected by this.
Ross  Do you have a point?
Chandler  You know, you think I would.
Chandler  What's up with the simian?
Ross  It's just a fur ball.
Chandler  Okay... (returning to the board) ..whose turn is it?
Ross  Yours, I just got 43 points for 'KIDNEY'.
Chandler  No, no, you got zero points for 'IDNEY'.
Ross  I had a 'K'. Where's where's my 'K'?
[Scene  The Emergency Room, Monica sits with Rachel, who is filling out an honest form
at last. Ross and Chandler hurtle in. Little Marcel, wrapped in a fluffy towel, is cradled
in Ross's arms. They dash up to the admissions desk. Ross is frantic.]
Ross  You've got to help me my monkey swallowed a 'K'!
Nurse  (angrily) You go get that animal outta here.

choking I don't know what else to do.

[Scene  Central Perk, Joey is playing "She Loves Me, She Loves Me Not" with
the petals of a flower, alternately looking hopeful and annoyed. Phoebe enters, but not as
herself, for she has changed the style of her hair and make-up to match that of her twin
sister. She hangs up her coat, revealing her new cardigan. Nervously, she smooths out the
identifying garment, approaching Joey who sits next to the main sofa.]
Phoebe  (as Ursula) Hey.
Joey  Urse...
Joey  ..ah, what're you doing here? I've been trying to call you.
Phoebe  (as Ursula) Listen, um...
Joey  No, no, no, don't say "listen." I know that "listen."
I've said that "listen."
Phoebe  (as Ursula) I'm sorry.
Joey  I don't get it. What happened? What about everything you said under the
bridge?
Joey  You don't drink.
Phoebe  (as Ursula) That's right, I don't... But I was, I was drunk on you!
Joey  Oh, Urse... (He tries to take her in his arms, but she fends him off.)
Phoebe  (as Ursula) Okay, yeah, so it's not gonna work.
Joey  Why? Is it because I'm friends with Phoebe?
Phoebe  (as Ursula) If it was, would you stop hanging out with her?
Joey  (Thinking carefully) no. No, I, I couldn't do that.
Phoebe  (as Ursula) Um, then yes, it's 'cause of Phoebe! So, you know, it's
either her or me.
Joey  Then, uh, then I'm sorry.
Phoebe  (as Ursula) You know... (unconsciously putting a hand on his knee)
You're gonna be really, really hard to get over.
Joey  I know...
Joey  I don't know whether it's just 'cause we're breakin' up or... what, but
you have never looked so beautiful.
Phoebe  Really?
Joey  Pheebs?
Phoebe  (Automatically) Yeah. Oooh... (she's sprung.)
[Scene  The Hospital, Marcel lies on the operating table while recovering from the
anaesthetic, tucked up under a sheet like an infant in a huge bed. Ross sits beside him,

Ross  He looks so tiny.
Joey  We just got the message.
Phoebe  Is he alright?
Ross  Yeah. The doctor got the 'K' out. He also found an 'M' and an 'O'.
Chandler  We think he was trying to spell out 'MONKEY.'
Ross  Well, the doctor says he's gonna be fine, he's just sleeping now.
Chandler  (Tapping Ross on his shoulder) So, you feel like a dad yet?
Ross  No, why?
Chandler  Hey, come on, you came through, you did what you had to do. That is
very dad.
Monica  Oh, look, he's waking up!
Ross  (Quietly) hey, fella! How you doing?
[Scene  Monica and Rachel's, everyone except Joey is there.  Rachel is looking out
of the window and Ross is handing out some Chinese takeout.  There's a small SAP in

the remote.)
Ross  ĄLo que sucedio es que no le gusta la tele! (The thing is, he doesn`t
like the program!)
Ross  Uh, Rach, we're running low on resumes over here.
Monica  Do you really want a job with Popular Mechanics?
Chandler  Well, if you're gonna work for mechanics, those are the ones to work
for.
Rachel  Hey, look, you guys, I'm going for anything here, OK? I cannot be a
waitress anymore, I mean it. I'm sick of the lousy tips, I'm sick of being called 'Excuse
me...'
Ross  Rach, did you proofread these?
Rachel  Uh... yeah, why?
Ross  Uh, nothing, I'm sure they'll be impressed with your excellent compuper
skills.
Rachel  (upset) Oh my Goood! Oh, do you think it's on all of them?
Joey  Oh no, I'm sure the Xerox machine caught a few.
[Scene  Central Perk, Ross and Chandler are sitting at a table. Rachel is working.
Monica and Phoebe enter.]
Monica  Hey, guys.
Chandler and Ross  Hey.
Monica  Lots of responses.
Phoebe  Wow!
Rachel  What?
Rachel  (grabs the bill) Give me that!
Chandler  You know, I can't believe you. Linda is so great! Why won't you go out
with her again?
Ross  I don't know.
Chandler  Is this still about her whole 'The Flintstones could've really
happened' thing?
Ross  No, it's not just that. It's justI want someone who... who does
something for me, y'know? Who gets my heart pounding, who... who makes me, uh... (begins
to stare lovingly at Rachel)
Chandler  ...little playthings with yarn?
Ross  What?
Chandler  Could you want her more?
Ross  Who?
Chandler  (sarcastically) Dee, the sarcastic sister from Whats Happening.
Rachel  Hi! How are you?
Ross  We're fine, we're fine.
Rachel  OK. (walks away)
Joey  Shut up!
Chandler  We're notwe're not saying anything.
Phoebe  What?
Ross  Uhhhh... Joey cried last night.
Joey  Thank you.
Chandler  (to the girls) We were playing poker, alright...
Joey  There was chocolate on the three. It looked like an eight, alright?
Ross  Oh, guys, you should've seen him. 'Read 'em and weep.'
Chandler  And then he did.
Rachel  Well, now, how come you guys have never played poker with us?
Phoebe  Yeah, what is that? Like, some kind of guy thing? Like, some kind of
sexist guy thing? Like it's poker, so only guys can play?
Ross  No, women are welcome to play.
Phoebe  Oh, OK, so then what is it? Some kind of... you know, like, like... some
kind of, y'know, like... alright, what is it?
Chandler  There just don't happen to be any women in our games.
Joey  Yeah, we just don't happen to know any women that know how to play poker.
Girls  Oh, yeah, right.
Monica  Oh, please, that is such a lame excuse!
Rachel  Really.
Monica  I mean, that's a typical guy response.
Ross  Excuse me, do any of you know how to play?
Girls  No.
Rachel  But you could teach us.
Guys  No.
[Scene  Monica and Rachel's, the guys are teaching the girls how to play poker.]
Chandler  (teaching) OK, so now we draw cards.
Monica  So I wouldn't need any, right? Cause I have a straight.
Rachel  Oh, good for you!
Phoebe  Congratulations!
Chandler  OK Phoebs, how many do you want?
Phoebe  OK, I just need two... the, um, ten of spades and the six of clubs.
Ross  No. No, uh, Phoebs? You can'tyou can't do...
Rachel  Oh wait, I have the ten of spades! Here! (gives it to Phoebe)
Ross 
Rachel  Oh, no-no-no-no-no-no, that's OK, I don't need them. I'm going for
fours.
Ross  Oh, you're... (gives up)
Monica  Alright, here we go. We've got salmon roulettes and assorted crudites.
Phoebe and Rachel  OOooooo!
Joey  Whoa, whoa, whoa, Monica, what're you doin'? This is a poker game. You
can't serve food with more than one syllable. It's gotta be like chips, or dip, or
pretz...(look of realization)
Chandler  (changing subject) OK, so at this point, the dealer...
Monica  Alright, you know, we got it, we got it. Let's play for real. High
stakes... big bucks...
Ross  Alright, now, you sure? Phoebe just threw away two jacks because they
didn't look happy...
Phoebe  But... I'm ready, so, just deal.
Chandler  OK, alright, last minute lesson, last minute lesson. (holds up two
cards) Joey... three... eight. Eight... three. (Joey is unamused) Alright babe, deal the
cards.
Monica  (throws down her cards) Dammit, dammit, dammit!
Joey  About what?
Phoebe  About how good your cards were.
Joey  Heh... I was bluffing.
Phoebe  A-ha! And... what is bluffing? Is it not another word for... lying?
Rachel  OK, sorry to break up this party, but I've got resumes to fax before
work tomorrow... (gets up to leave)
Guys  Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Chandler  Rach, Rach, we gotta settle.
Rachel  Settle what?
Chandler  The... Jamestown colony of Virginia. You see, King George is giving us
the land, so...
Ross  The game, Rachel, the game. You owe us money for the game.
Rachel  Oh. Right.
Joey  You know what, you guys? It's their first time, why don't we just forget
about the money, alright?
Monica  Hell no, we'll pay!
Phoebe  OK, Monica? I had another answer all ready.
Monica  And you know what? We want a rematch.
Ross  Well that's fine with me. Could use the money.
Ross  (pause)...Yeah.
Chandler  Yes, and I get my ya-yas from Ikea. You have to put them
together yourself, but they cost a little less.
Ross  Look, Rachel, this is poker. I play to win, alright? In order for me to
win, other people have to lose. So if you're gonna play poker with me, don't expect me to
be a 'nice guy,' OK? Cause once those cards are dealt... (claps hands three times)
Joey  (pause)...Yeah?
Ross  I'm not a nice guy.
[Scene  Ross' apartment. Chandler and Joey are there. Ross enters with a pizza.]
Ross  Alright boys, let's eat.
Chandler  Oh, did you get that from the 'I Love Rachel' pizzeria?
Ross  You still on that?
Ross  You are way off, pal.
Joey  No, I don't think so, see Ross, because I think you love her.
Ross  Um.... no. See, I might've had feelings for her at one timenot any
more. I justI...
Ross  Marcel! Where are you going with that disc?
Ross  You are not putting that on again! Marcel, OKif you press that
button, you are in very, very big trouble.
[Scene  Monica and Rachel's, Rachel, Monica, and Phoebe are there.]
Rachel  (opening mail) Can you believe what a jerk Ross was being?
Monica  Yeah, I know. He can get really competitive.
Phoebe  Ha. Ha, ha.
Monica  What?
Phoebe  Oh, hello, kettle? This is Monica. You're black.
Monica  Please! I am not as bad as Ross.
Rachel  Oh, I beg to differ. The Pictionary incident?
Monica  That was not an incident! I-I was gesturing, a-and the plate
slipped out of my hand.
Monica  You're kidding! Where? Where?
Monica  Oh, Rachel!
Phoebe  Oh, it's like the mother ship is calling you home.
Monica  Well, what's the job?
Rachel  Assistant buyer. Oh! I would be shopping... for a living!
Monica  OK, look. That is Aunt Iris. This woman has been playing poker since she
was five. You gotta listen to every word she says. (opens door) Hi!
Aunt Iris  Is Tony Randall dead?
Rachel  No.
Monica  I don't think so.
Rachel  Why?
Aunt Iris  Well, he may be now, because I think I hit him with my car.
Monica  What?
Rachel  Oh my God!
Monica  Really?
Phoebe  Thank y... (thinks about it)
Aunt Iris  Girls, sit down.
Monica  Uh, Aunt Iris? This is Phoebe, and that's Rachel...
Aunt Iris  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, listen, I am parked at a meter. Let's
do it.
[Scene  Ross's apartment, everyone but Rachel is seated around his table. The Lion
Sleep Tonight plays in the background.]
Phoebe  Ross, could we please, please, please listen to anything else?
Ross  Alright.
Ross  I'm gonna pay for that tonight.
Rachel  Hi!
Ross  Hey.
Rachel  Guys! Guess what, guess what, guess what, guess what!
Chandler  Um, ok... the... the fifth dentist caved and now they're all
recommending Trident?
Rachel  Noooo... the interview! She loved me! She absolutely loved me. We talked
for like two and a half hours, we have the same taste in clothes, andoh, I went to
camp with her cousin... And, oh, the job is perfect. I can do this. I can do this well!
All  That's great! That's wonderful!
Rachel  Oh God, oh, and then she told the funniest story...
Monica  OK, great. You'll tell us and we'll laugh. Let's play poker.
Joey  Alright now listen, you guys, we talked about it, and if you don't want to
play, we completely understand.
Chandler  Oh yes, yes, we could play some other game... like, uh, I don't
know... Pictionary?
Monica  Ha, ha, very funny, very funny. But I think we'd like to give poker
another try. Shall we, ladies?
Phoebe and Rachel  Yes, we should. I think we should.
Ross  Uh, Rach, do you want me to shuffle those?
Rachel  No, no, thats OK. Y'know, I think I'm gonna give it a go.
Ross  Alright.
Rachel  Alright... (shuffles cards expertly, all the guys stare in amazement)
[Scene  Ross's Apartment, continued from earlier.]
Ross  So, Phoebs owes $7.50, Monica, you owe $10, and Rachel, you owe fifteen
big ones.
Joey  But hey, thanks for teachin' us Cross-Eyed Mary. You guys, we gotta play
that at our regular game.
Phoebe  Alright, here's my $7.50. (Hands them the money) But I think you should
know that this money is cursed.
Joey  What?
Phoebe  Oh, I cursed it. So now bad things will happen to he who spends it.
Chandler  That's alright, I'll take it. Bad things happen to me anyway. This way
I can break 'em up with a movie.
Ross  Well, that just leaves the big Green poker machine, who owes fifteen...
Rachel  Mmm-hmmm. Oh, so typical. Ooo, I'm a man. Ooo, I have a penis. Ooo, I
have to win money to exert my power over women. (hands over her money)
Monica  You know what? This is not over. We will play you again, and we will
win, and you will lose, and you will beg, and we will laugh, and we will take every last
dime you have, and you will hate yourselves forever.
Rachel  Hmm. Kinda stepped on my point there, Mon.
[Scene  Monica and Rachel's, everyone is there ready for another poker game.]
Ross  So, you gals wanna hand over your money now? That way, we don't have to go
through the formality of actually playing.
Rachel  Ooooh, that's fine. We'll see who has the last laugh there, monkey boy.
Monica  OK, we done with the chit-chat? Are we ready to play some serious poker?
Phoebe  (holding a card and waving it in front of her face) Hey you guys, look,
the one-eyed jack follows me wherever I go. (they look at her) Right, OK, serious poker.
Monica  Excuse me, where are you going?
Ross  Uh... to the bathroom.
Monica  Do you want to go to the bathroom, or do you wanna play poker?
Ross  I want to go to the bathroom. (exits)
Joey  Alright, well, I'm gonna order a pizza. (gets up)
Rachel  Oh no-no-no-no-no, I'm still waiting to hear from that job and the store
closes at nine, so you can eat then.
Joey  That's fine. I'll just have a Tic-Tac to hold me over.
Monica  Alright, Cincinnati, no blinds, everybody ante. (deals cards)
Phoebe  (looks at her cards) Yes! (everyone looks at her) .... or no.
Rachel  Your fly is open, Geller. (he checks it, and zips up)
Phoebe  You guys, you know what I just realized? 'Joker' is 'poker' with a 'J.'
Coincidence?
Chandler  Hey, that's... that's 'joincidence' with a 'C'!
Joey  Uh... Phoebe? Phoebe?
Phoebe  Yeah. Um... I'm out. (throws in cards)
Rachel  I'm in.
Monica  Me too.
Joey  Me too. Alright, whattaya got.
Ross  Well, you better hop outta the shower, cause... I gotta flush. (lays down
cards)
Rachel  And your fly's still open...
Rachel  Ha, I made you look....
Rachel  I couldn't be inner. Monica?
Phoebe  Monica, in or out?
Monica  (slams down cards) I hate this game!
Phoebe  OK Joey, your bet.
Joey  Ahhh, I fold like a cheap hooker who got hit in the stomach by a fat guy
with sores on his face. (the girls look at him, confused) Oh, I'm out.
Phoebe  Ross?
Ross  Oh, I am very in.
Phoebe  Chandler?
Chandler  Couldn't be more out. (throws in cards)
Phoebe  Me too. Rachel.
Rachel  Uh, I will see you... and I'll raise you. (throws chips in pot) What do
you say... want to waste another buck?
Ross  No, not this time. (he folds) So... what'd you have?
Rachel  I'm not telling. (collects chips)
Ross  Come on, show them to me. (reaches for her cards, Rachel covers them up)
Rachel  No..!
Ross  Show them to me!
Rachel  Get your hands out of there! No!
Ross  Let me see! Show them!
Chandler  Y'know, I've had dates like this.
Rachel  (deals new hand) Boy, you really can't stand to lose, can you? Your
whole face is getting red... little veins popping out on your temple...
Phoebe  Plus that shirt doesn't really match those pants.
Ross  First of all, I'm not losing...
Rachel  Oh, you are losing. Definitely losing. (phone rings)
Ross  Let's not talk about losing. Just deal the...
Rachel  (answering phone) Hel-lo, Rachel Green.
Ross  (mimicking Rachel) Mee mee, mee-mee mee.
Rachel  (on phone) Excuse me. (covers up phone; to Ross) It's about the job.
Rachel  Barbara! Hi, how are you? (Listens) Uh-huh. (Listens) No, I understand.
Yeah. Oh, oh, come on, no, I'm fine. Don't be silly. Yeah... oh, but you know, if-if
anything else opens up, pleaHello? Hello? (hangs up phone, very depressed)
Monica  Sorry, Rach.
Phoebe  Y'know, there's gonna be lots of other stuff.
Rachel  Yeah...(sigh)....OK. Where were we? Oh, OK... five card draw, uh...
jacks or better... nothing wild, everybody ante.
Joey  Look, Rachel, we don't have to do this.
Rachel  Yes, we do. (pause)
Monica  Alright, check.
Joey  Check.
Ross  I'm in for fifty cents. (throws it in)
Chandler  Call.
Phoebe  I'm in.
Rachel  I see your fifty cents... and I raise you... five dollars. (throws it
in)
Ross  I thought, uh... it was a fifty cent limit.
Rachel  Well, I just lost a job, and I'd like to raise the bet five bucks. Does
anybody have a problem with that?
Ross  No, I fold. (lays cards down, and gets up)
Rachel  What do you mean, you fold? Hey, come on! What is this? I thought that
'once the cards were dealt, I'm not a nice guy.' I mean, what, were you just full of it?
Ross  I'm in. (throws in chips)
Rachel  How many you want?
Ross  One. (Rachel gives him the card.)
Rachel  Dealer takes two. (she deals herself two cards) What do you bet?
Ross  I bet two dollars. (throws it in)
Rachel  OK... see your two... and I raise you twenty. (throws it in)
Ross  I see your twenty, raise you twenty-five. (throws it in)
Rachel  See your twenty-five...and...uh, Monica, get my purse.
Monica  Rachel, there's nothing in it.
Rachel  OK, then get me your purse.
Monica  OK, here you go. Good luck.
Rachel  (to Monica) Thank you. (to Ross)
Phoebe  ...teen! (throws in a ten-dollar bill)
Joey  That's OK, Ross, you can ask me. What?
Ross  Fifteen.
Chandler  Alright, here's ten. (gives it to him)
Joey  Here, I got five, I got five. (Ross takes the money)
Ross  Thank you.
Chandler  Good luck.
Rachel  (lays down cards) Full house.
Ross  You got me.
Ross  Oh, well, when you don't have the cards, you don't have the cards, you
know. (looks at Rachel) But, uh... look how happy she is. (smiles)
[Scene  Monica and Rachel's, all six are playing Pictionary at Monica's
apartment. Monica is drawing a picture, and the three guys are guessing. She draws what
looks like an airplane.]
Chandler  Airplane! Airport! Airport '75! Airport
'77! Airport '79!
Rachel  Oh, time's up.
Monica  (pointing at the drawing, upset) Bye... bye... BIRDIE.
Joey  Oh!
Phoebe  That's a bird?
Phoebe  That's a bird!
Rachel  OK, OK, it's my turn. (reads the answer)
Chandler  Go.
Ross  Uh.... bean! Bean!
Joey  (triumphantly) The Unbearable Likeness of Being!
Rachel  Yes!
Monica  That, you get? That, you get?
{Transcriber's Note  The credits list two characters, Tia and Samantha,
who I assume are the sweaty women Joey and Chandler meet. However, I don't know which is
which, so I've simply called them Woman #1 and Woman #2.}
[Scene  Central Perk, Rachel is talking to a customer.]
[Scene  Central Perk, Monica enters with some mail.]
Monica  Mail call, Rachel Green, bunk seven.
Rachel  Thank you. (Examines it) Oh, cool! Free sample of coffee!
Monica  Oh good! 'Cause where else would we get any?
Rachel  Oh. Right. ...Oh great.
Monica  What is it?
Rachel  Country club newsletter. My mother sends me the engagement notices for
'inspiration.' Oh my God! Oh my God, it's Barry and Mindy!
Monica  Barry who you almost...?
Rachel  Barry who I almost.
Monica  And Mindy, your maid of...?
Rachel  Mindy, my maid of. Oh!
Monica  (Takes it) That's Mindy? Wow, she is pretty. (Sees Rachel's look) Lucky.
To have had a friend like you.
[Scene  Monica and Rachel's, Rachel and Ross are eating Chinese.]
Ross  Marcel. Bring me the rice, c'mon. Bring me the rice, c'mon. Good boy. Good
boy. C'mere, gimme the rice. (Marcel brings the rice) Thank you, good boy. Well, I see
he's finally mastered the difference between 'bring me the' and 'pee in the'. (Rachel
ignores him) 'Bring me the' and- Rach?
Rachel  What?
Ross  Hi.
Rachel  Oh, I'm sorry. Oh, this is so stupid! I mean, I gave Barry up, right? I
should be happy for them! I am, I'm happy for them.
Ross  Really.
Rachel  No. Oh, oh, I guess it would be different if I were- with somebody.
Ross  Whoah, uh, what happened to, uh, 'Forget relationships! I'm done with
men!' The whole, uh, penis embargo?
Rachel  Oh, I don't know. I guess it's not about no guys, it's about the right
guy, y'know? I mean, with Barry, it was safe and it was easy, but there was no heat. With
Paolo, that's all there was, was heat! And it was just this raw, animal, sexual...
Ross  Wait-wait. I, I got it. I was there.
Rachel  Well, I mean, do you think you can ever have both? Y'know? Someone who's
like, who's like your best friend, but then also can make your toes curl?
Ross  Yes. Yes. Yes! Yes, I really do! In fact, it's funny, very often, someone
who you wouldn't think could-could curl your toes, might just be the one who...
Monica  Hi.
Ross  ...Gets interrupted. Hi!
Rachel  Hi, how was the movie?
Monica  Wonderful!
Phoebe  So good!
Joey  Suck-fest.
Chandler  Toootal chick-flick.
Phoebe  I-I'm sorry it wasn't one of those movies with, like, y'know, guns and
bombs and, like, buses going really fast...
Joey  Hey, I don't need violence to enjoy a movie. Just so long as there's a
little nudity.
Monica  There was nudity!
Joey  I meant female nudity. Alright? I don't need to see Lou
Grant frolicking.
Monica and Phoebe  Hugh! Hugh Grant!
Ross  Alright, I've gotta go. C'mon, Marcel! C'mon! We're gonna go take a bath.
Yes we are, aren't we? Yes, we are.
Chandler  They're still just friends, right?
Rachel  (To Marcel) And I will see you tomorrow!
Ross  That's right, you're gonna spend tomorrow at Aunt Rachel's, aren't you.
Monica  Oh, hang on, hang on. Does Aunt Monica get a say in this?
Ross  'Pwease, Aunt Monica, pwease?' Oh, unclench. You're not even gonna be
there.
[Scene  Joe-G's Pizza, the guys are there.]
Chandler  I can't believe we are even having this discussion.
Joey  I agree. I'm, like, in disbelief.
Chandler  I mean, don't you think if things were gonna happen with Rachel, they
would've happened already?
Ross  I'm telling you, she said she's looking for a relationship with someone
exactly like me.
Joey  She really said that?
Ross  Well, I added the 'exactly like me' part... But she said she's looking for
someone, and someone is gonna be there tonight.
Joey  'Tonight' tonight?
Ross  Well, I think it's perfect. Y'know, it's just gonna be the two of us, she
spent all day taking care of my monkey...
Chandler  I can't remember the last time I got a girl to take care of my monkey.
Ross  Anyway, I figured after work I'd go pick up a bottle of wine, go over
there and, uh, try to woo her.
Chandler  Hey, y'know what you should do? You should take her back to the
1890's, when that phrase was last used.
[Scene  Monica and Rachel's, Rachel is taking care of Marcel and they are watching a
soap opera.]
Rachel  Now, now the one in the feather boa, that's Dr. Francis. Now, she used
to be a man. Okay, now look, see, there's Raven. We hate her. We're glad she's dying.
Okay- (Marcel pushes down a cushion to reveal a shoe) Wh- wh- Marcel, are you playing with
Monica's shoes? You know you're not supposed to pl- whoah. Marcel, did you poo in the
shoe? (Takes the shoe into the kitchen) Marcel, bad monkey! Oh! Oh! (She notices the
newsletter and taps the contents of the shoes onto it, then folds it shut) Sorry, Barry.
Little engagement gift. I'm sure you didn't register for that. (She leaves the apartment
holding the newsletter at arm's length. However, she leaves the door open. Marcel runs out
in the opposite direction. There is a shot from the TV and Rachel runs back in) Who died?
Who died? Roll him over! Oh, c'mon, roll him over! Oh...! Well, we know it wasn't Dexter,
right Marcel? Because- (Looks down and notices he is missing) Marcel? Marc- (Notices the
open door)
Joey  How could you lose him?
Rachel  I don't know. We were watching TV, and then he pooped in Monica's shoe-
Monica  Wait. He pooped in my shoe? Which one?
Rachel  I don't know. The left one.
Monica  Which ones?
Rachel  Oh. Oh, those little clunky Amish things you think go with everything.
Phoebe  (Entering) Hey.
All  Hi.
Phoebe  Whoah, ooh, why is the air in here so negative?
Chandler  Rachel lost Marcel.
Phoebe  Oh no, how?
Monica  He- he pooped in my shoe.
Phoebe  Which one?
Monica  Those cute little black ones I wear all the time.
Phoebe  No, which one? The right or left? 'Cause the left one
is lucky...
Rachel  C'mon, you guys, what're we gonna do, what're we gonna do?
Joey  Alright alright. You're a monkey. You're loose in the city. Where do you
go?
Chandler  Okay, it's his first time out, so he's probably gonna wanna do some of
the touristy things. I'll go to Cats, you go to the Russian Tea Room.
Rachel  Oh, my, God, c'mon, you guys! He's gonna be home any minute! He's gonna
kill me!
Monica  Okay, we'll start with the building. You guys take the first and second
floor, Phoebe and I'll take third and fourth.
Rachel  Well, what'm I gonna do? What'm I gonna do?
Monica  Okay, you stay here, and just wait by the phone. Spray Lysol in
my shoe, and wait for Ross to kill you.
Rachel  Anybody wanna trade? Oh...
Mr. Heckles  Whaddyou want?
Monica  Mr. Heckles, our friend lost a monkey. Have you seen it?
Mr. Heckles  I left a Belgian waffle out here, did you take it?
Monica  No!
Phoebe  Why would you leave your Belgian waffle in the hall?
Mr. Heckles  I wasn't ready for it.
Monica  A monkey. Have you seen a monkey?
Mr. Heckles  Saw Regis Philbin once...
Phoebe  Okay, thank you, Mr. Heckles. (They move off)
Mr. Heckles  You owe me a waffle.
Rachel  (On the phone) Okay, he's a, he's a black capuchian monkey with a white
face... (Enter Ross) ...with, with Russian dressing and, and pickles on the side. Okay.
Thanks.
Ross  Hey. How did, uh, how'd it go today?
Rachel  Great! It went great. Really great. Hey, is that wine?
Ross  Yeah. You, uh, you want some?
Rachel  Oh, I would love some. But y'know what? Y'know what? Let's not drink it
here. I'm feeling kinda crazy. You wanna go to Newark?
Ross  Uh, okay, yeah, we could do that, but before we head off to the murder
capital of the North-East, I was, uh, kinda wanting to run something by you. Y'know how we
were, uh, y'know, talking before about, uh, relationships and stuff? (Uncorks the wine)
Well-
Rachel  Oh God, Ross, I cannot do this.
Ross  Okay, quick and painful. (Starts to cork the wine)
Rachel  Oh God... Okay. Alright. Alright. Okay. Ross, please don't hate me.
Ross  Oh, what? What-what?
Rachel  Y'know Marcel?
Ross  ...Yeah?
Rachel  Well, I kind of... I kind of lost him.
[Scene  Monica and Rachel's, continued from earlier.]
Ross  (Angry) I- I- I ca- I can't believe this. I mean, all I asked you to do
was keep him in the apartment.
Rachel  I know, I know, I'm sorry-
Ross  No, y'know what, I guess it's partially my fault. Y'know, I shouldn't've,
uh, asked you to start off with a monkey. I should've started you off with like a pen or a
pencil.
Rachel  (Tearfully) Ross, I'm doing everything that I can, I've got everybody
looking for him, and I- (Door buzzer goes and she runs to get it) Oh! Who is it?
Intercom  Animal Control.
Rachel  See? I've even called Animal Control!
Ross  You called Animal Control?
Rachel  Uh-huh... why... do you not like them?
Ross  Marcel is an illegal exotic animal. I'm not allowed to
have him in the city. If they find him, they'll take him away from me.
Rachel  O-okay, now see, you never ever ever told us that...
Ross  That's right, I.. 'cause I didn't expect you were gonna invite them to the
apartment!
Rachel  Hi, thanks for coming.
Luisa  (Animal Control) Somebody called about a monkey?
Rachel  Oh, y'know what? That was a complete misunderstanding! (Ross puts his
arms around her and they act all sweetness and light)
Ross  Yeah, we thought we had a monkey, but we-we didn't.
Rachel  Turned out it was a hat.
Ross  Cat!
Rachel  Cat! What'm I saying? Cat!
Monica  Hi. We checked the third and fourth floor, no-one's seen Marcel.
Luisa  Marcel?
Ross  My uncle Marcel.
Phoebe  Oh, is that who the monkey's named after?
Luisa  Oookay. Are you aware that possession of an illegal exotic is, uh,
punishable by up to two years in prison and confiscation of the animal?
Phoebe  Oh my God. You'd put that poor little creature in jail?
Monica  Pheebs, you remember how we talked about saying things quietly to
yourself first?
Phoebe  Yes, but there isn't always time!
Monica  Look. I'm sure there's some friendly way to reconcile this! Um, have a
seat. First of all, we haven't been introduced, I'm Monica Geller.
Luisa  Oh my God, you are! And you're Rachel Green!
Rachel  Yeah!
Luisa  Luisa Gianetti! Lincoln High? I sat behind you guys in home room!
Rachel  Luisa? Oh my God! Monica! It's Luisa!
Monica  The Luisa from home room!
Rachel  Yes!!
Luisa  You have no idea who I am, do you.
Monica  No, none at all.
Rachel  None.
Luisa  Well, maybe that's because you spent four years ignoring me. I mean,
would it have been so hard to say 'Morning, Luisa'? Or 'Nice overalls'?
Monica  Oh, I'm- I'm so sorry!
Luisa  Ah, it's not so much you, you were fat, you had your own problems. (To
Rachel) But you? What a bitch!
Rachel  What?!
Monica  Be that as it may, d'you think you could just help us out here on that
monkey thing? Y'know, just for old times' sake? Go Bobcats?
Luisa  I could... but I won't. If I find that monkey, he's mine. (Leaves)
Phoebe  Dun-dun-duuuur! Sorry.
Chandler  Marcel?
Joey  Marcel?
Chandler  Marcel?
Joey  Marcel?
Woman No. 1  Hi, can I help you?
Chandler  Um, we're kind of having an emergency and we-we were looking for
something...
Joey  A monkey.
Chandler  Yes have you seen any?
Woman No. 1  No. No, haven't seen a monkey. Do you know anything about fixing
radiators?
Joey  Um, sure! Did you, uh, did you try turning the knob back the other way?
Woman No. 1  Of course.
Joey  Oh. Then, no.
Woman No. 2  Did I put too much rum in here?
Woman No. 1  Just a sec. (To Chandler and Joey) Hope you find your monkey. (She
starts to shut the door)
Chandler  Oh, nononowaitwaitwaitnono! Uh... we may not know anything about
radiators per se, but we do have a certain amount of expertise in the heating and
cooling... mileu.
Joey  Uh, aren't we kind of in the middle of something here?
Chandler  Yes, but these women are very hot, and they need our help! And they're
very hot.
Joey  We can't, alright? (To the women) We're sorry. You have no idea how sorry,
but... We promised we'd find this monkey. If you see him, he's about yea high and answers
to the name Marcel, so if we could get some pictures of you, you'd really be helping us
out.
Chandler  Okay, from now on, you don't get to talk to other people.
Joey  Marcel?
Chandler  Marcel?!
Phoebe  Marcel?
Monica  Marcel?
Phoebe  Marcel?
Both  Marcel?
Phoebe  Oh-my-God!
Monica  Whaaat!
Phoebe  Something just brushed up against my right leg!
Monica  What is it?
Phoebe  Oh, it's okay, it was just my left leg.
Monica  Look, Phoebe!
Phoebe  Yeah! Oh, c'mere, Marcel! Oh, Marcel, c'mere!
Luisa  Step aside, ladies! (She loads a gun)
Monica  What're you gonna do?
Luisa  Just a small tranquiliser.
Monica  Run, Marcel, run! Run, Marcel! (Marcel runs off and Luisa runs after
him. Monica goes to check up on Phoebe) Are you okay?
Phoebe  Yeah, think so. Oh! (She notices the tranquiliser dart has hit her in
the butt and removes it) Huh. (Sways back) Whoah.
Monica  Oh gosh.
Ross  Marcel?
Rachel  Marcel?
Ross  Marc- oh, this is ridiculous! We've been all over the neighbourhood. He's
gone, he's-he's just gone.
Rachel  Ross, you don't know that.
Ross  Oh come on. It's cold, it's dark, he doesn't know the Village. (Kicks a
sign in frustration) And now I have a broken foot. I have no monkey, and a broken foot!
Thank you very much.
Rachel  Ross, I said I'm sorry like a million times. What do you want me to do?
You want me to break my foot too? Okay, I'm gonna break my foot, right here. (Kicks the
sign) Ow!! Oh! Oh my God, oh my God! There, are you happy now?!
Ross  Yeah, yeah. Y'know, now that you kicked the sign, hey! I don't miss Marcel
any more!
Rachel  Y'know, it is not like I did this on purpose.
Ross  Oh, no no no. Nono, this is just vintage Rachel. I mean, things just sort
of happen around you. I mean, you're off in Rachel-land, doing your Rachel-thing, totally
oblivious to people's monkeys, or to people's feelings...
Rachel  Ross.
Ross  I don't even wanna hear it, you're just...
Rachel  Ross.
Ross  Oh, forget it, okay?
Rachel  Ross!
Ross  What? What?
Both  Hey! Hey, Bananaman!
(Scene 4  Everyone in the hall outside Mr. Heckles' door. Ross is carrying the box of
bananas. He bangs on the door)
Phoebe  Oh, this is so intense. One side of my butt is totally asleep, and the
other side has no idea.
Ross  Hi, did you order some bananas?
Mr. Heckles  What about it?
Ross  Gimme back my monkey.
Mr. Heckles  I don't have a monkey.
Rachel  Then what's with all the bananas?
Mr. Heckles  Potassium.
Ross  Marcel? Marcel? Okay, where is he? Where is he? Marcel? Marcel?
Ross  Marcel! What've you done to him?
Mr. Heckles  That's my monkey. That's Patti, Patti the monkey.
Ross  Are you insane? C'mere, Marcel, c'mon. (Marcel starts to go to him)
Mr. Heckles  C'mere, Patti. (Marcel turns round)
Ross  C'mere, Marcel. (Turns to Ross)
Mr. Heckles  C'mere, Patti. (Turns to Mr. Heckles)
Luisa  (Out of shot) Here, monkey. Here, monkey! Here, monkey! (Marcel runs to
the door and into Luisa's cage, which she slams shut) Gotcha.
Ross  Okay, gimme my monkey back.
Mr. Heckles  That's my monkey.
Luisa  You're both gonna have to take this up with the judge.
Mr. Heckles  That's not my monkey. Just the dress is mine, you can send that
back whenever.
Ross  Alright, I want my monkey.
Luisa  No!
Rachel  Oh, c'mon, Luisa!
Luisa  Sorry, prom queen.
Ross  (To Rachel) You had to be a bitch in high school, you couldn't've been
fat.
Rachel  Alright. In high school I was the prom queen and I was the homecoming
queen and the class president and you... were also there! But if you take this monkey, I
will lose one of the most important people in my life. You can hate me if you want, but
please do not punish him. C'mon, Luisa, you have a chance to be the bigger person here!
Take it!
Luisa  Nope.
Rachel  Alright. Well then how about I call your supervisor, and I tell her that
you shot my friend in the ass with a dart?
[Scene  Monica and Rachel's. Rachel and Ross are there. Ross is trying to get the dress
off Marcel.]
Ross  It'll be nice to get this off finally, won't it? Yes it will. (Marcel
resists) Or we can leave it on for now, that's fine.
Rachel  Y'know, with the right pair of pumps, that would be a great little
outfit.
Ross  Listen, I'm- I'm sorry I was so hard on you before, it's just I...
Rachel  Oh, Ross, c'mon. It's my fault, I almost lost your...
Ross  Yeah, but you were the one who got him back, y'know? You, you were great.
...Hey, we uh, we still have that, uh, that bottle of wine. You in the mood for, uh,
something grape?
Rachel  That'd be good.
Ross  Alright. (He goes to get the glasses. Then he hesitates and turns off the
main light. Rachel looks round and he acts surprised) The, uh, the neighbours must be
vacuuming. (He sits down and starts to pour the wine) Well, so long as we're here and, uh,
not on the subject, I was thinking about, uh, how mad we got at each other before, and,
um, I was thinking maybe it was partially because of how we, um...
Barry  Rachel.
Rachel  Barry?!
Barry  I can't. I can't do it, I can't marry Mindy. I think I'm still
in love with you.
Ross and Rachel  Oh!
Ross  We have got to start locking that door!
[Scene  Central Perk, Monica, Joey, Phoebe, and Chandler are looking through Monica's
high school yearbook]
Monica  This is me in The Sound of Music. See the von Trapp kids?
Phoebe  Nope.
Monica  That's because I'm in front of them.
Chandler  Eh. I thought that was an alp.
Monica  Well, high school was not my favourite time.
Joey  I dunno, I loved high school. Y'know? It was just four years of parties
and dating and sex.
Chandler  Yeah, well I went to boarding school with four hundred boys. Any sex I
had would've involved a major lifestyle choice.
Monica  Gosh, doesn't it seem like a million years ago?
Phoebe  Oh. Oooh! Ooh! Ooh! (She stands up and starts to dance around) Ooh! My
butt cheek is waking up! Oooh! Ooh!
[Scene  Monica and Rachel's, everyone is there.]
Chandler  I can't believe you would actually say that. I would much
rather be Mr.Peanut than Mr.Salty.
Joey  No way! Mr.Salty is a sailor, all right, he's got to be, like, thetoughest
snack there is.
Ross  I don't know, you don't wanna mess with corn nuts. They're craaazy.
Monica  (looking out of the window) Oh my God. You guys! You gotta come see
this! There's some creep out there with a telescope!
Ross  I can't believe it! He's looking right at us!
Rachel  Oh, that is so sick.
Chandler  I feel violated. And not in a good way.
Phoebe  How can people do that?... (All but Phoebe walk away from the window in
disgust.) Oh, you guys, look! Ugly Naked Guy got gravity boots!
[Scene  Central Perk, everyone but Rachel is there.]
Chandler  I am telling you, years from now, schoolchildren will study it as one
of the greatest first dates of all time. It was unbelievable! We could totally be
ourselves, we didn't have to play any games...
Monica  So have you called her yet?
Chandler  Let her know I like her? What are you, insane? (The girls make
disgusted noises.) It's the next day! How needy do I want to seem? (To the guys) I'm
right, right?
Joey and Ross  Oh, yeah. Yeah. Let her dangle.
Monica  I can't believe my parents are actually pressuring me to find one of you
people.
Phoebe  Oh, God, just do it! (Grabbing the phone.) Call her! Stop being so
testosteroney!
Chandler  Which, by the way, is the real San Francisco treat. (Calls her, then
hurriedly hangs up.) I got her machine.
Joey  Her answer machine?
Chandler  No, interestingly enough her leaf blower picked up.
Phoebe  So, uh, why didn't you say anything?
Chandler  Oh, no-no-no-no. Last time I left a spontaneous message I ended up
using the phrase "Yes indeedy-o."
Monica  Look look! It's Rachel and Barry. No, don't everybody look at once!
Ross  Okay, okay, what's going on?
Phoebe  Okay, they're just talking...
Ross  Yeah, well, does he look upset? Does he look like he was just told to
shove anything?
Phoebe  No, no actually, he's smiling.. and... Oh my God, don't do that!!
Ross  What? What? What?!
Phoebe  That man across the street just kicked that pigeon! (Rachel enters.) Oh!
Chandler  (bluffing) And basically, that's how a bill becomes a law.
All  Oh!... Right!
Chandler  Hey Rach!
Monica  How'd it go?
Rachel  Y'know, it was, uh.. it was actually really great. He took me to lunch
at the Russian Tea Room, and I had that chicken, where y'know you poke it and all
the butter squirts out...
Phoebe  Not a good day for birds...
Rachel  Then we took a walk down to Bendall's, and I told him not to,
but he got me a little bottle of Chanel...
Ross  That's nice... now, was that before or after you told him to stop calling,
stop sending you flowers and to generally leave you alone, hmm?
Rachel  Right,.. well,.. we never actually got to that... Oh, it was just so
nice to see him again, y'know? It was comfortable, it was familiar... it was just nice!
Ross  That's, that's nice twice!
Monica  Rachel, what's going on? I mean isn't this the same Barry who you left
at the altar?
Joey  Duh, where've you been?
Rachel  Yeah, but it was different with him today! And he wasn't, like,
Orthodontist Guy, y'know? I mean, we had fun! Is there anything wrong with that?
Chandler  Yes!
Rachel  Why?
Chandler  I have my reasons.
Monica  Okay, how about the fact that he's engaged to another woman, who just
happens to be your ex-best friend?
Rachel  All right. All right, all right, all right, all right, I know it's
stupid! I will go see him this afternoon, and I will just put an end to it!
[Scene  Barry's Office, the post-coital Barry and Rachel are recovering on the chair.]
Rachel  Wow... Wow!
Barry  Yeah.
Rachel  I'm not crazy, right? I mean, it was never like that.
Barry  Nooo, it wasn't.
Rachel  Ooh, and it's so nice having this little sink here...
[Scene  Monica and Rachel's, everyone is there except Rachel.]
Chandler  (on phone, reading from a script) Oh, Danielle! I wasn't expecting the
machine... Give me a call when you get a chance. (Rattles some dishes) Bye-bye. (Hangs
up.) Oh God!
Monica  That's what you've been working on for the past two
hours?!
Chandler  Hey, I've been honing!
Ross  What was with the dishes?
Chandler  Oh, uh.. I want her to think I might be in a restaurant.. y'know? I
might have some kind of life, like I haven't been sitting around here honing for the past
few hours.
Monica  (looking out the window) Look look! He's doing it again, the guy with
the telescope!
Phoebe  Oh my God! (Walks to the window) Go away! (Gesturing.) Stop looking in
here!
Monica  Great, now he's waving back.
Joey  Man, we gotta do something about that guy. This morning, I caught him
looking into our apartment. It creeps me out! I feel like I can't do stuff!
Monica  What kinda stuff?
Joey  Will you grow up? I'm not talking about sexy stuff, but, like, when I'm
cooking naked.
Phoebe  You cook naked?
Joey  Yeah, toast, oatmeal... nothing that spatters.
Chandler  What are you looking at me for? I didn't know that.
[Scene  Barry's Office, Rachel and Barry are getting dressed.]
Barry  What's the matter?
Rachel  Oh, it's just... Oh, Barry, this was not good.
Barry  No, it was. It was very very good.
Rachel  Well, what about Mindy?
Barry  Oh, way, way better than Mindy.
Rachel  No, not that, I mean, what about you and Mindy?
Barry  Well, if you want, I'll justI'll just break it off with her.
Rachel  No. No-no-no-no, no. I mean, don't do that. Not, I mean not for me.
Bernice  (over intercom) Dr. Farber, Bobby Rush is here for his adjustment.
Barry  (into intercom) Thanks, Bernice. (To Rachel) Let's go away this weekend.
Rachel  Oh, Barry..! Come on, this is all way too..
Barry  We can, we can go to Aruba! When I went there on what would have been our
honeymoon, it was, uh... it was really nice. You would've liked it.
Rachel  I had a bra.
Bobby  Hey, Dr. Farber.
Barry  All right Miss Green, everything looks fine... Yep, I think we're
starting to see some real progress here.
Rachel  What?!
Bobby  I'm twelve, I'm not stupid.
[Scene  Monica and Rachel's, Chandler enters clutching his phone.]
Chandler  Can I use your phone?
Monica  Yeah.. uh, but for future reference, that thing in your hand can also be
used as a phone.
Chandler  Yes, it's working! Why isn't she calling me back?
Joey  Maybe she never got your message.
Phoebe  Y'know, if you want, you can call her machine, and if she has a lot of
beeps, that means she probably didn't get her messages yet.
Chandler  Y'don't think that makes me seem a little...
Ross  ...desperate, needy, pathetic?
Chandler  Ah, you obviously saw my personal ad.
Phoebe  How many beeps?
Chandler  She answered.
Monica  Y'see, this is where you'd use that 'hello' word we talked about.
Chandler  I'm not gonna talk to her, she obviously got my message and is
choosing not to call me. Now I'm needy and snubbed. God, I miss just being needy.
All  Hey! Hi!
Phoebe  How'd he take it?
Rachel  Pretty well, actually... (Wandering into the kitchen.)
Monica  (wandering in after her) Uh, Rach... how come you have dental floss in
your hair?
Rachel  Oh, do I?
Monica  Uh huh.
Rachel  (in a low voice) We ended up having sex in his chair.
Monica  You had sex in his chair?!... I said
that a little too loudly, didn't I?
Ross  You-you had what?
Phoebe  Sex in his chair.
Ross  What, uh... what were you thinking?
Rachel  I don't know! I mean, we still care about each other. There's a history
there. 'S'like you and Carol.
Ross  No! No no, it is nothing like me and Carol!
Rachel  Please. If she said to you, "Ross, I want you on this couch, right
here, right now," what would you say?
Chandler  If it helps, I could slide over.
Ross  It's, it's, it's, uh, a totally diferent situation! It's, it's apples and
oranges, it's, it's orthodontists and lesbi- I gotta go.
Phoebe  Where are you going?
Ross  (leaving) I just have to go, all right? Do I need a reason? Huh? I mean I
have things to do with my life, I have a jam packed schedule, and I am late- for keeping
up with it. Okay?
Chandler  Hello? Hello?
Rachel  (on phone) Hello?(Listens) Mindy! Hi! Hey, how are you? (Listens) Yes,
yes, I've heard, congratulations, that is so great. (Listens) Really? (Listens) Oh.
(Listens) Okay. Okay, well I'm working tomorrow, but if you want you can, you can, you can
come by and... (Listens) Okay... (Listens) Great... (Listens) Great... (Listens) All
right, so I'll, so I'll see you tomorrow! (Listens) Okay.. (Listens) Okay... (Listens)
Bye. (Hangs up and sits down heavily.) Oh God. Oh God. Oh God.
Chandler  So how's Mindy?
Rachel  Oh, she wants to see me tomorrow...Oh, she sounded really weird, I gotta
call Barry... (Does so, on phone) Hi, it's me, I just.. Mindy!! Mindy! Hi! No, I figured
that's where you'd be!
[Scene  Monica and Rachel's, the next morning.  Chandler is sitting and staring at
his phone.  Monica enters and creeps up next to Chandler.]
Monica  Brrrrrrr!
Chandler  Hell is filled with people like you.
Joey  (entering) He's back! The peeper's back!
Joey  (ducking) Get down!
Rachel  Get down?
Chandler  ...And boogie!
Rachel  Thanks, but I gotta go to work and get my eyes scratched out by Mindy.
Monica  Relax. Y'know, she may not even know.
Rachel  Please. I haven't heard from her in seven months, and now she calls me?
I mean, what else is it about? Oh! She was my best friend, you guys! We went to camp
together... she taught me how to kiss..
Joey  (intrigued) Yeah?
Rachel  And now, y'know, I'm like... I'm like the other woman! I feel so..
Joey  ..Naughty!
Rachel  Right, I'll see you guys later...
Joey  Oh, hold up, I'll walk out with you. Now, Rach, when she taught you to
kiss, you were at camp, and.. were you wearing any kinda little uniform, or- (Rachel exits
and slams the door in his face.) That's fine, yeah...
Chandler  Okay, I'm gonna go to the bathroom. Will you watch my phone?
Monica  Why don't you just take it with you?
Chandler  Hey, we haven't been on a second date, she needs to hear me pee?
Monica  Why don't you just call her?
Chandler  I can't call her, I left a message! I have some pride.
Monica  Do you?
Chandler  No! (Calls) Danielle, hi! It's, uh, it's Chandler! (Listens) I'm fine.
Uh, listen, I don't know if you tried to call me, because, uh, idiot that I am, I
accidentally shut off my phone. (Listens) Oh, uh, okay, that's fine, that's great.
(Listens) Okay. (Puts down the phone.) (to Monica) She's on the other line, she's gonna
call me back. (He starts doing a little jig.) She's on the other line, she's gonna call me
back, she's on the other line, gonna call me back...
Monica  Don't you have to pee?
Chandler  'S'why I'm dancing...
[Scene  Central Perk, Rachel is serving coffee as Mindy enters.]
Rachel  Mindy.
Mindy  Hey, you.
Rachel  Hey, you.... So, what's up?
Mindy  Um.. we should really be sitting for this.
Rachel  Sure we should... So.
Mindy  Now, I know things've been weird lately, but you're like my oldest friend
in the world... Except for maybe Laurie Schaffer, who I don't talk to anywhere, 'cause
she's all bitter now that she lost the weight and it turns out she doesn't have a pretty
face. ....Okay, I'm just gonna ask you this once, and I want a straight answer.
Rachel  Okay.
Mindy  Will you be my maid of honour?
Rachel  Of course!
Mindy  Oh that's so great!
Rachel  Was that all you wanted to ask me?
Mindy  That's all!
Rachel  Ohhhh!! (Mindy starts to sob.) ...What? What?
Mindy  That's not all.
Rachel  Oh sure it is!
Mindy  Oh no, it isn't! No! I think Barry is seeing someone in the city.
Rachel  Um, what- what would make you think that?
Mindy  Well, ever since we announced the engagement, he's been acting really
weird, and then last night, he came home smelling like Chanel.
Rachel  (draws back) Really. Mindy, if it'll make you feel any better, when I
was engaged to him he went through a whole weird thing too.
Mindy  Oh God! You see, that's what I was afraid of!
Rachel  What? What's what you were afraid of?
Mindy  Okay, okay... when Barry was engaged to you, he and I...kind of... had a
little thing on the side.
Rachel  What?
Mindy  I know. I know, and when he proposed to me, everyone said "Don't do
it, he's just gonna do to you what he did to Rachel," and now I feel so stupid.
Rachel  Uh... Oh, Mindy, you are so stupid. Oh, we are both so stupid.
Mindy  What do you mean?
Rachel  (offers her arm to Mindy and she sniffs) Smell familiar?
Mindy  Oh no.
Rachel  Oh, I am so sorry.
Mindy  No me, I am so sorry...
Joey  (watches them for a while) Oh my.
[Scene  Monica and Rachel's, Phoebe and Ross are doing a crossword, Monica is cooking,
and Chandler is still staring at his phone.]
Chandler  Ring dammit, ring!
Ross  Thanks.
Joey  (entering) Hey, you know our phone's not working?
Chandler  What?!
Joey  I tried to call you from the coffee shop, and there was no answer.
Chandler  (investigating) I turned it off. Mother of God, I turned it off!
Monica  Just like you told her you did! (Chandler glares at her.) ... Just
pointing out the irony.
Joey  Hey, so listen, I went across the street and talked to the doorman- I got
the peeper's name! Can I use the phone?
Chandler  Nngghhh!!!!!!!
Joey  (to Monica) Can I use your phone? (On phone) Yeah, the number for a Sidney
Marks, please.
Ross  "Heating device."
Phoebe  Radiator.
Ross  Five letters.
Phoebe  Rdtor.
Joey  (on phone) Yeah, is Sidney there? (Listens) Oh, this is? (To the gang)
Sidney's a woman.
Monica  So she's a woman! So what?
Joey  Yeah. Yeah, so what? (On phone) Look, I live across the street, (walking
to the window) and I know all about you and your little telescope, and I don't appreciate
it, okay? (Listens) Yeah, I can see you right now! (Listens) Hello! (Listens) If I wanna
walk around my apartment in my underwear, I shouldn't have to feel
like(Listens)Thank you, but... that's not really the point... (Listens) The
point is that... (Listens) Mostly free weights, but occasionally..
Monica  Joey!!
Joey  (on phone) Yeah, my neighbor... (Listens) Yeah, the brunette... (to
Monica) She says you looked very pretty the other day in the green dress.
Monica  The green dress? Really?
Joey  Yeah, she said you looked like Ingrid Bergman that day.
Monica  (waves dismissively to Sidney) Nooo!
[Scene  Barry's Office, Barry is preparing his tools alone as Rachel enters.]
Rachel  Hey. Got a second?
Barry  Sure, sure. Come on... (Mindy enters) ...in...
Mindy  Hello, sweetheart.
Barry  Uh... uh... what're'you... what're'you guys doing here?
Rachel  Uh, we are here to break up with you.
Barry  Both of you?
Mindy  Basically, we think you're a horrible human being, and bad things should
happen to you.
Barry  I'm sorry... I'm sorry, God, I am so sorry, I'm an idiot, I was weak, I
couldn't help myself! Whatever I did, I only did because I love you so much!
Rachel  Uh- which one of us are you talking to there, Barr?
Barry  ....Mindy. Mindy, of course Mindy, it was always Mindy.
Rachel  Even when we were having sex in that chair?
Barry  (to Mindy) I swear, whatever I was doing, I was always thinking of you.
Rachel  Please! During that second time you couldn't have picked her out of a
lineup!
Mindy  (to Rachel) You did it twice?
Rachel  Well, the first time didn't really count... I mean, y'know, 's'Barry.
Mindy  Okay...
Barry  (to Mindy) Sweetheart, just gimme- gimme another chance, okay, we'll
start all over again. We'll go back to Aruba.
Bernice  (over intercom) Dr. Farber, we've got a bit of an emergency
here...Jason Costalano is choking on his retainer.
Barry  Oh God... (Into intercom) I'll be right there, Bernice. (to Mindy) Look,
please, please don't go anywhere, okay? I'll be, I'll be right back.
Rachel  Okay. Okay, we'll be here! Hating you! Did you see how he was sweating
when he walked out of there? Listen honey, if I'm hogging the ball too much you just jump
right in there and take a couple punches because I'm telling you, this feels great.
Mindy  Yeah... I'm pretty sure I'm still gonna marry him.
Rachel  What are you talking about?! Mindy, the guy is the devil! He's Satan in
a smock!
Mindy  Look, I know he's not perfect, but the truth is, at the end of the day, I
still really wanna be Mrs. Dr. Barry Farber, D.D.S.
Rachel  Oh God.
Mindy  I hope you can find some way to be happy for me. And I hope you'll still
be my maid of honor...?
Rachel  And I hope Barry doesn't kill you and eat you in Aruba.
[Scene  Monica and Rachel's, Monica and Rachel are there.]
Monica  You okay?
Rachel  Yeah.
Monica  Really?
Rachel  Yeah! Y'know, ever since I ran out on Barry at the wedding, I have
wondered whether I made the right choice. And now I know.
Monica  Aww... (They hug)
Joey  Big day.
[Scene  Central Perk, everyone is there.]
Joey  All right, I'll give you this, Mr. Peanut is a better dresser. I mean he's
got the monocle, he's got the top hat...
Phoebe  You know he's gay?
Danielle  (entering) Chandler?
Chandler  Danielle! Hi! Uh- everybody, this is Danielle, Danielle, everybody.
All  Hi. Hi.
Chandler  What are you doing here?
Danielle  Well, I've been calling you, but it turns out I had your
number wrong. And when I finally got the right one from Information, there was no answer.
So I thought I'd just come down here, and make sure you were okay.
Chandler  ...I'm, I'm okay.
Danielle  Listen uh, maybe we could get together later?
Chandler  That sounds good. I'll call you- or you call me, whatever...
Danielle  You got it.
Chandler  Okay.
Danielle  G'bye, everybody.
All  Bye.
Phoebe  Whoo-hoo!
Monica  Yeah, there you go!
Ross  Second date!
Chandler  ...I dunno.
Rachel  You don't know?!
Chandler  Well, she seems very nice and everything, but that whole thing about
her coming all the way down here, just to see if I was okay? I mean,... how needy is that?

[Scene  Monica and Rachel's, everyone is looking at papers.]
Joey  How could someone get a hold of your credit card number?
Monica  I have no idea. But look how much they spent!
Rachel  Monica, would you calm down? The credit card people said that you only
have to pay for the stuff that you bought.
Monica  I know. It's just such reckless spending.
Ross  I think when someone steals your credit card, they've kind of already
thrown caution to the wind.
Chandler  Wow, what a geek. They spent $69.95 on a Wonder Mop.
Monica  That's me.
Phoebe  Oh! The yuk! Ross, he's doing it again! (Points to a lamp which is
shaking behind the sofa)
Ross  Marcel, stop humping the lamp! Stop humping! Now Marcel, come back-
(Marcel runs toward Rachel's room) come here, Marcel-
Rachel  Oh no, not in my room! I'll get him.
Monica  Ross, you've got to do something about the humping.
Ross  What? It's, it's just a phase.
Chandler  Well, that's what we said about Joey...
Ross  Would you all relax? It's not that big a deal.
Rachel  (Out of shot) Stop it! Marcel! Bad monkey!
Ross  What?
Rachel  Let's just say my Curious George doll is no longer curious.
[Scene  Monica and Rachel's, late at night Monica is still examining her bill as Rachel
emerges from her room.]
Rachel  Oh, Monica. You are not still going over that thing.
Monica  This woman's living my life.
Rachel  What?
Monica  She's living my life, and she's doing it better than me! Look at this,
look. She buys tickets for plays that I wanna see. She, she buys clothes from stores that
I'm intimidated by the sales people. She spent three hundred dollars on art supplies.
Rachel  You're not an artist.
Monica  Yeah, well I might be if I had the supplies! I mean, I could do all this
stuff. Only I don't.
Rachel  Oh, Monica, c'mon, you do cool things.
Monica  Oh really? Okay, let's compare, shall we.
Rachel  (Yawning) Oh, it's so late for 'Shall we'...
Monica  Do I go horseback riding in the park? Do I take classes at the New
School?
Rachel  (Yawning) Nooo...
Monica  This is so unfair! She's got everything I want, and she doesn't have my
mother.
[Scene  Central Perk, Joey and Chandler are discussing stage names.]
Chandler  How about Joey... Pepponi?
Joey  No, still too ethnic. My agent thinks I should have a name that's more
neutral.
Chandler  Joey... Switzerland?
Joey  Plus, y'know, I think it should be Joe. Y'know, Joey makes me sound like
I'm, I dunno, this big. (Waitress looks at him funny) Which I'm not.
Chandler  Joe...Joe...Joe...Stalin?
Joey  Stalin...Stalin...do I know that name? It sounds familiar.
Chandler  Well, it does not ring a bell with me...
Joey  (Writes it down) Joe Stalin. Y'know, that's pretty good.
Chandler  Might wanna try Joseph.
Joey  Joseph Stalin. I think you'd remember that!
Chandler  Oh yes! Bye Bye Birdie, starring Joseph Stalin. Joseph Stalin is the
Fiddler on the Roof.
[Scene  Monica and Rachel's, Monica is there as Phoebe and Rachel enter.]
Rachel  Hey.
Phoebe  Hey.
Monica  Hi. (On the phone) Hi, uh, yes, this is Monica Geller. Um, I believe I'm
taking some classes with you and I was wondering what they were.
Phoebe  What are you doing?
Monica  (Hushes her) Alright, great. Thanks a lot. (Hangs up) I'm going to tap
class.
Rachel  What, what, so that you can dance with the woman that stole your credit
card?
Monica  This woman's got my life, I should get to see who she is.
Rachel  Go to the post office! I'm sure her picture's up! ...Okay, Monica,
y'know what, honey, you're kinda losing it here! I mean, this is really becoming like a
weird obsession thing.
Phoebe  This is madness. It's madness, I tell you, for the love of God,
Monica, don't do it!! ...Thank you.
[Scene  A Tap Class, the girls are standing at the door.]
Monica  What d'you think?
Phoebe  Lotsa things.
Rachel  Which one do you think she is?
Teacher  May I help you?
Monica  Oh, no thanks, we're just here to observe.
Teacher  You don't observe a dance class. You dance
Rachel  What does she mean?
Phoebe  I think she means (Imitates) 'You dance
Monica  Okay, d'y'see anybody you think could be me?
Teacher  (To the class) People! Last time there were some empty yoghurt
containers lying around after class. Let's not have that happen again!
Rachel  She could be you.
Teacher  Let's get started. Five, six, a-five six seven eight...
Monica  Okay, I'm not getting this!
Phoebe  (Dancing in a swirly, Phoebe kind of way) I'm totally getting it!
Monica  Did you ever feel like sometimes you are just so unbelievably
uncoordinated?
Rachel  What? You just click when they click.
Teacher  Alright people, now everyone grab a partner.
Phoebe  Okay. And, my, dead, mother, says, you, are, it. I'm with Rachel.
Monica  Great. It's gym class all over again.
Phoebe and Rachel  Aww.
Teacher  Well that's all right, you can come up to the front and dance with me.
Monica  Why don't I just take off my clothes and have a nightmare.
Woman  It's okay, it's okay, I'm here, I'm here. Sorry I'm late, okay, here I
am. Who's the new tense girl?
Teacher  She's your partner.
Woman  Hi. I'm Monica.
Monica  Oh. Monica! ...Hi. I'm Mo- ...nana.
Woman  (Fake Monica) Monana?
Monica  Yeah. It's Dutch.
Fake Monica  You're kidding! I-I spent three years in Amsterdam. (Asks her
something in Dutch)
Monica  Um, Pennsylvania Dutch.
Teacher  And we're dancing. A-five, six, seven, eight...
[Scene  Central Perk, Ross is entering.]
Ross  (Mortified) Hi.
Chandler and Joey  Hey.
Joey  Where've you been?
Ross  At the vet.
Chandler  She's not gonna make you wear one of those big plastic cones, is she?
Ross  She says Marcel's humping thing's not a phase. Apparently he's reached
sexual maturity.
Joey  (To Chandler) Hey! He beat ya.
Ross  She says as time goes on, he's gonna start getting agressive and violent.
Chandler  So what does this mean?
Ross  I'm gonna have to give him up.
[Scene  Central Perk, scene continued from earlier.  They guys are sitting there
like the Three Monkeys.]
Joey  I can't believe it, Ross. This sucks!
Chandler  I don't get it, I mean, you just got him. How can he be an adult
already?
Ross  I know. I know. I mean, one day, he's this little thing, and before you
know it, he's this little thing I can't get off my leg.
Joey  Isn't there any way you can keep him?
Ross  No, no. The vet says unless he's in a place where he has regular access to
some... monkey lovin,' he's just gonna get vicious. I've just gotta get him into a zoo.
Joey  How do you get a monkey into a zoo?
Chandler  I know that one! ...No, that's Popes into a Volkswagen.
Ross  Well, we're applying to a lot of them. Naturally our first choice would be
one of the bigger state zoos, y'know, like, uh, San Diego... right? But that might just be
a pipe dream, because, y'know, he's out of state. Uh, my vet, uh, knows someone at Miami,
so that's a possibility.
Chandler  Yeah, but that's like two blocks away from the beach. I mean, it's a
total party zoo.
Phoebe  Hey. We found her, we found the girl.
Chandler  What?
Joey  Did you call the cops?
Rachel  Nope. We took her to lunch.
Chandler  Ah. Your own brand of vigilante justice.
Ross  What?! Are you insane? This woman stole from you. She stole. She's a
stealer.
Monica  Y'know what? After you're with this woman for like ten minutes, you
forget all that. I mean, she is this astounding person, with this, with this amazing
spirit.
Ross  Yeah, which she probably stole from some cheerleader.
Chandler  ...Take off their hats!
Phoebe  Popes in a Volkswagen! ...I love that joke.
[Scene  Monica and Rachel's, Monica, Rachel and Fake Monica are there.]
Rachel  No way. No way did you do this.
Fake Monica  Monana was very brave.
Monica  It was so wild. We told them we were the Gunnersens in room six fifteen.
Only to find out the Boston Celtics had taken over the entire sixth floor!
Fake Monica  So once they caught on to the fact that we're, y'know, short and
have breasts...
Monica  ...They threw us out! I was thrown out of a hotel! Me!
Rachel  Go Monana! Well, you ladies are not the only ones living the dream. I
get to go pour coffee for people I don't know. Don't wait up. (Exits)
Fake Monica  Oh, by the way, tomorrow we're auditioning for a Broadway show.
Monica  'Scuse me?
Fake Monica  There's an open call for Cats. I'm thinking we go down there, sing
Memories and make complete fools of ourselves. Whaddya say?
Monica  Nononononono. Think who you're dealing with here. I mean, I'm not like
you. I-I can't even stand in front of a tap class.
Fake Monica  Well, that's just probably 'cause of your Amish background.
Monica  What?
Fake Monica  Well, you're Pennsylvania Dutch, right?
Monica  Right. Till I bought a blow dryer, then I was shunned.
Fake Monica  I-I used to be just like you. And then one day I saw a movie that
changed my life. Did you ever see Dead Poets' Society?
Monica  Uh-huh.
Fake Monica  I thought that movie was so incredibly... boring.
I mean, that thing at the end where the kid kills himself because he can't be in the play?
What was that?! It's like, kid, wait a year, leave home, do some community theatre. I
walked out of there and I thought, 'Now, that's two hours of my life that I'm never
getting back.' And that thought scared me more than all the other crap I was afraid to do.
Monica  Wow. Then I would definitely not recommend Mrs. Doubtfire.
[Scene  Monica and Rachel's, tiem lapse.  Everyone but Joey and Monica are there.]
Ross  (Reading letters) Oh God. (To Marcel) We didn't get into Scranton. (To the
others) That was like our safety zoo. They take like dogs and cows. See? I don't know who
this is harder on, me or him.
Phoebe  I'd say that chair's taking the brunt.
Ross  Marcel! Marcel! Marcel, no! Good boy. See, how can nobody want him?
Rachel  Oh, somebody will.
Joey  (entering) You know there already is a Joseph Stalin?
Chandler  You're kidding.
Joey  Apparently he was this Russian dictator who slaughtered all these people.
You'd think you would've known that!
Chandler  Y'know, you'd think I would've.
Joey  Phoebe. Whaddyou think a good stage name for me would be?
Phoebe  ...Flame Boy.
[Scene  Central Perk, Ross is talking to Dr. Baldhara, a zookeeper.]
Ross  Where exactly is your zoo?
Dr. Baldhara  Well, it's technically not a zoo per se, it's more of an
interactive wildlife experience. Let me ask you some questions about, is it, uh, Marcel?
Ross  Yes.
Dr. Baldhara  Does he, uh, fight with other animals?
Ross  No-no, he's, he's very docile.
Dr. Baldhara  Even if he were... cornered?
Ross  Well I, I don't know. Why?
Dr. Baldhara  Uh, how is he at handling small objects?
Ross  He can hold a banana, if that's whatcha mean...
Dr. Baldhara  How about a hammer, or a small blade?
Ross  Why- why- why would he need a blade?
Dr. Baldhara  Well, if he's up against a jungle cat or an animal with horns,
you've got to give the little guy something. Otherwise it's just cruel.
Chandler and Joey  He- he- he got in, he- he got in to San
Diego.
Joey  We, we come back from our walk and the- the phone was ringing...
Chandler  ...He's in.
Ross  He's in! Oh, did you hear that, Marcel? San Diego. San Diego!
Dr. Baldhara  You're making a big mistake here. I mean, San Diego's all well and
good, but if you give him to me, I'll start him off against a blind rabbit and give you
twenty percent of the gains.
[Scene  Monica and Rachel's, Rachel is dusting. She comes to the table, lifts all the
magazines and wipes under them, then just puts them down again. Monica bursts in,
obviously drunk.]
Monica  Yo- hooo!
Rachel  Where the hell've you been?
Monica  Monica and I just crashed an embassy party.
Rachel  Are you drunk?!
Monica  Noooo! (Comes closer and whispers) I'm lying. I am so drunk.
Rachel  Oh God, oh. Great, Monica, y'know what, you could've called, I have been
up here, I've been worried...
Rachel  Monica? Monica!
Monica  Water rules!
Rachel  Yes, yes, it does. Okay, look, the restaurant called, they wanna know if
you're gonna be showing up for work?
Monica  Nope. Going to the Big Apple Circus today.
Rachel  Okay Monica, what are you doing? You're gonna lose your job! This is not
you!
Monica  No, it is me! Y'know, I'm not just the person who needs to fluff the
pillows and pay the bills as soon as they come in! Y'know, when I'm with her, I am so much
more than that. I'm- I'm Monana!
Rachel  Hello? Yes, she is, hold on a second, please. Monana, it's for you, the
credit card people.
Monica  Helloooo? Yeah. Oh my God. Thanks.
Rachel  What?
Monica  They've arrested Monica.
[Scene  New York City Department of Correction, Monica is visiting Fake Monica.]
Monica  Hi.
Fake Monica  Hey.
Monica  How are you?
Fake Monica  I'm not too bad. Fortunately, blue's my colour. How-how did you
know I was here?
Monica  Because... I'm Monica Geller. It was my credit card you were using.
Fake Monica  That I was not expecting.
Monica  I want you to know, it wasn't me who turned you in.
Fake Monica  Oh. Thanks.
Monica  No, thank you! You have given me so much! I mean, if it wasn't for you,
I would never have gotten to sing Memories on the stage at the Wintergarden
Theater!
Fake Monica  Well, actually, you only got to sing 'Memo-'.
Monica  I just can't believe you're in here. I mean, what am I gonna do without
you? Who's gonna crash the embassy parties with me? Who's gonna take me to the Big
Apple Circus?
Fake Monica  Monica, I started my day by peeing in front of twenty-five other
women, and you're worried about who's gonna take you to the Big Apple Circus?
Monica  Well, not... worried, just... wondering.
Fake Monica  There's nothing to wonder about, Monica. You're gonna go back to
being exactly who you were, because that's who you are.
Monica  Not necessarily...
Fake Monica  Yes necessarily! I mean, I dunno what it is, maybe it's the Amish
thing.
Monica  Um, I'm not actually Amish.
Fake Monica  Really? Then why are you like that?
[Scene  Tap Class, Monica is standing by the door.]
Teacher  You by the door. In or out?
Monica  In. (She joins in the dancing. She still flounders)
Teacher  You in the back, you're getting it all wrong!
Monica  Yeah, but at least I'm doing it!
[Scene  The Airport, everyone but Monica is there to see off Marcel.]
PA  This is the final boarding call for flight 67 to San Diego,
boarding at gate 42A.
Phoebe  Okay. Good-bye, little monkey guy. Alright, I wrote you this poem. Okay,
but don't eat it 'till you get on the plane.
Ross  Aww. Thank you, Aunt Phoebe.
Phoebe  Oh!
Chandler  Okay, bye, champ. Now, I know there's gonna be a lot of babes in San
Diego, but remember, there's also a lot to learn.
Joey  I dunno what to say, Ross. Uh, it's a monkey.
Ross  Just, just say what you feel.
Joey  Marcel, I'm hungry.
Ross  That was good.
Rachel  (Brings Marcel a teddy bear) Marcel, this is for you. It's, uh, just,
y'know, something to, um, do on the plane.
Ross  Uh, if you guys don't mind, I'd like to take a moment, just me and him.
All  Oh, sure. Sure, absolutely. (They just stand there, then realise
what he means and go to the other end of the room)
Ross  Marcel, c'mere, c'mere. (He sits down and Marcel jumps down and sits
beside him) Well buddy, this is it. There's just a coupla things I want to say. I'm really
gonna miss you, and I'm never gonna forget about you. You've been more than just a pet to
me, you've been more like a be- (Marcel climbs down and starts humping his leg) Okay,
Marcel, please, could you leave my leg alone? Could you just stop humping me for two
seconds?! Marcel, would- okay, just take him away. Just take him.
[Scene  A Theater, there is a casting session going on for a play.]
Actor  (Very melodramatically, and very badly) Oh, that I were a glove
upon that hand, that I might... touch thy cheek...
Casting Director No. 1  That's fine, thank you.
Casting Director No. 2  Next. (Joey walks onstage)
Joey  Hi, uh, I'll be reading for the role of Mercutio.
Casting Director No. 2  Name?
Joey  Holden McGroin.
Monica  Tell him.
Rachel  No.
Phoebe  Tell him, tell him.
Monica  Just...please tell him.
Rachel  Shut up!
Chandler  Tell me what?
Monica  Look at you, you won't even look at him.
Chandler  (sarcastically) Oh, come on tell me. I could use another reason why
women won't look at me.
Rachel  All right, all right, all right. Last night, I had a dream that, uh, you
and I, were...
Phoebe  Doing it on this table. (points at the table)
Chandler  Wow!
Joey  Exellent dream score.
Ross  Why, why, why would you dream that?
Chandler  More importantly, was I any good?
Rachel  Well, you were pretty damn good.
Chandler  Interesting, cause in my dreams, I'm allways surprisingly inadequate.
(Monica pats him on his lap)
Rachel  Well, last night you seemed to know your way around the table.
Ross  I love it, when we share.
Chandler  You're okay there?
Ross  I can't belive you two had sex in her dream.
Chandler  I'm sorry, it was a one-time-thing. I was very drunk and i was
somebody else's subconscious.
[Scene  Central Perk, continued from earlier, Chandler is sitting on the table.]
Chandler  Hello Rachel.
Rachel  Get off.
Phoebe  (points at Joey's pen) Uh, uh, gimme. Can you see me operating a drill
press?
Joey  I don't know. What are you wearing?
Ross  Pheebs, why would you want to operate a drill press?
Phoebe  Just for some short-term-work. You know, until I get back some of my
massage clients.
Chandler  Pirates again?
Phoebe  No, nothing like that. I was just...such a dummie. I taught this
"massage-yourself-at-home-workshop." And they are.
Joey  Hey, hey, Chan. She could work for you.
Chandler  (sarcasticly) Thanks Joey, that's a good idea.
Phoebe  What... I could, I could do it. What is it?
Chandler  Well, my secretary is gonna be out for a couple of weeks. She is
having one of her boobs redused. (Ross looks at her.) It's a whole big boob story.
Phoebe  I could be a secretary.
Chandler  Well, you know Phoebs. I don't know if it's your kinda thing, because
it involves a lot of being normal. For a large portion of the day.
Phoebe  I could do that.
Rachel  What are you playing with?
Ross  Oh, it's my new beeper.
Joey  What the hell does a paleontologist need a beeper for?
Monica  Is it like for dinosaur emergencies. 'Help, come quick, they're still
extinct.'
Ross  No, it's for when Carol goes into labor. She can get me wherever I am. I
mean, all she has to do is to dial 55-JIMBO.
Chandler  A cool phone number, and a possible name for the kid.
Monica  All right, I'll see you guys later. (raises)
Rachel  Off to see young Ethan?
Monica  Thank you.
Joey  How young is young Ethan? Young?
Monica  He's... our age.
Chandler  When we were?
Monica  Okay, he's a senior in college.
Ross  College?
Chandler  Whoa! And this manchild has no problem with how old you are?
Monica  No, of course not. It's not even an issue. Cause I told him I was 22.
All  What?
Monica  Oh, I can't pass for 22?
Phoebe  Well, maybe 25-26.
Monica  I am 26.
Phoebe  There you go.
[Scene  Chandler's office, he and Phoebe are there when the phone starts ringing.]
Chandler  Can you hear that?
Phoebe  (plays with a thumbtack remover) Yeah?
Chandler  See that'll stop when you pick up the phone.
Phoebe  Oh. Uh, I'm on. (picks up the phone)
Phoebe  (with a deep voice) Mr. Bing's office. (Listens) No I'm sorry, he's in a
meeting right now.
Chandler  I'm not in a meeting. I'm right... Whoops.
Phoebe  Will he know what this is in reference to? (Listens) And he has your
number? (Listens) All right, I'll see that he gets the message. Bye bye.
Chandler  What?
Phoebe  Ross says hi.
Chandler  Ah!
Phoebe  This is so fun. All right, what do we do now?
Chandler  Well, now, I actually have to get to work.
Phoebe  Most likely. (raises and goes toward the door) Okay, I'm gonna be out
there.
Chandler  Okay.
Phoebe  All right. Bye bye.
Chandler  Bye bye.
Chandler  (answering it) Yes?
Phoebe  Whatcha doin'?
Chandler  Ooh. (leans against the desk)
[Scene  Monica and Rachel's, Monica and Rachel are there. Monica is just finishing
cleaning the windows.]
Monica  Windows are clean, candels are lit. Uh, belt's to tight, gotta change
the belt. Did I turn the fish? (goes over to the kitchen to check on the dinner) No, cause
I made lasagne. (to Rachel) Am I out of control?
Rachel  Just a touch. Mon, I don't understand. I mean, you've been dating this
guy since like, what... his midterms? I mean, why all the sudden are you so... Oh.
Monica  What?
Rachel  Could tonight be the Night?
Monica  I don't know. Look he's a great guy and I love being with him but... you
know. Things happen, and they happen. You don't plan these things.
Rachel  So, did you shave your legs?
Monica  Yeah.
Rachel  A-ha!
[Scene  Central Perk. Joey and Ross are there.]
Joey  Would you let it go Ross. It was just a dream. It doesn't mean...
Ross  Oh, oh. Oh, oh. Oh this is it. Oh my god it's baby time. Baby time.
Joey  All right, relax, relax. Just relax, just relax. Be cool, be cool.
Ross  (on phone) Yeah, hi, I was just beeped. (pause) No, André is not here.
(to Joey) Third time today. (on phone) Yes, I'm sure... No, sir. I don't perform those
kind of services.
Joey  Services? (Ross looks at him) Oh, services.
Ross  (on phone) Yeah, you want 55-JUMBO. Yeah, that's right. That's right,
JUMBO with a U, sir. (pause) No, belive me, you don't want me. Judging by his number, I'd
be a huge disappointment. (pause) All rightie, bye bye.
Joey  Hey, hey. How was the first day?
Phoebe  Oh, exellent. Everyone was so, so nice.
Chandler  See, it pays to know the man who wears my shoes. (Joey and Ross wonder
what he means) Me.
Phoebe  No, I didn't tell anybody that I knew you.
Chandler  Why not?
Phoebe  Oh, because, you know... they don't like you.
Chandler  What?!
Phoebe  I thought you knew that.
Chandler  Noho. Who doesn't they like me?
Phoebe  Everyone. Except for uh... no everyone.
Chandler  What are you talking about?
Phoebe  Don't feel bad. You know they used to like you a lot. But then you got
promoted, and, you know, now you're like "Mr. Boss Man". You know, Mr. Bing. Mr.
Bing, "Boss Man Bing".
Chandler  I can't belive it.
Phoebe  Yeah, yeah. They even do you.
Chandler  They do me?
Phoebe  You know like... uh okay... uh... 'Could that report be any
later?'
Chandler  I don't sound like that.
Ross  Oh, oh Chandler...
Joey  Oh... Yeah, you do.
Ross  'The hills were alive with the sound of music.'
Joey  (reaches for hi scones) My scones.
Phoebe, Joey, and Ross  'My scones.'
Chandler  Okay, I don't sound like that. That is so not true.
Chandler  That is so not... That is so not...
That... Oh, shut up!
[Scene  Monica and Rachel's, Monica and Young Ethan are sitting in the couch.]
Monica  Did not.
Young Ethan  I am telling you, up until I was, like nine, I thought that
gunpoint was an actual place where crimes happen.
Monica  How was that possible?
Monica  Okay.
Young Ethan  Okay.
Monica  Unless...
Young Ethan  What?
Monica  Uh, ah. Unless you wanna stay over? I mean, I'm going to, so...
Young Ethan  Yeah, I'd really like that.
Young Ethan  Uuh, before we get into any staying-over-stuff, there is something
you should know.
Monica  Okay, is this like 'I have an early class tomorrow' or 'I'm secretly
married to a goat?'
Young Ethan  Well it's somewhere in between. You see, in a strictly technical
sense, of course, I'm not uh..., well I, I mean I haven't ever uh...
Monica  Ethan?
Young Ethan  Yeah?
Monica  Are you a virgin?
Young Ethan  Well, if that's what you kids are calling it these days then, yes I
am. I uh, I've kinda been waiting for the right person.
Monica  Really?
Young Ethan  Yeah. You do know I was talking about you, right?
Young Ethan  Wow!
Monica  You keep saying that.
Young Ethan  You know, you read about it, you see it in the movies. Even when
you practice it at home, man oh man, it is nothing like that.
Monica  Listen, uh, you told me something that was really difficult for you. And
I, I-I figured if you could be honest, then I can to.
Young Ethan  Oh god, don't tell me, I did it wrong.
Monica  No-no. Nothing wrong about that.
Young Ethan  Oh.
Monica  Um, okay, here it goes. I'm not 22. I'm, I'm 25... and thirteen months.
Young Ethan  Huh!
Monica  But I figured, you know, that shouldn't change anything. I mean, what
the hell does it matter how old we are.
Young Ethan  Uh, listen um, as long as we're telling stuff, uh, I have another
one for you. I'm a little younger than I said.
Monica  You're not a senior?
Young Ethan  Oh, I'm a senior... in High School.
Monica  Ok...ay.
[Scene  Monica's Bedroom, continued from earlier.]
Monica  What we did was wrong. Oh god, I just had sex with somebody that wasn't
alive during the Bicentennial.
Young Ethan  I just had sex.
Monica  Ethan, focus. How could you not tell me?
Young Ethan  Well, you never told me how old you were.
Monica  Well, that's different. My lie didn't make one of us a felon in 48
states. What were you thinking?
Young Ethan  I wasn't thinking. I was too busy fallin'...
Monica  Don't say it. (closes Ethan's mouth with her hand)
Young Ethan  ...in love with you.
Monica  Really?
Young Ethan  (nods) Sorry.
Monica  Well,fall out of it. You know, you shouldn't even be here, it's a school
night. Oh god, oh god. I'm like those women that you see with shiny guys named Chad. I'm
Joan Collins.
Young Ethan  Who?
[Scene  Monica and Rachel's, everyone exept Monica is there.]
Ross  (on phone) Okay, André should be there in like 45 minutes. All rightie,
bye bye. (to Phoebe) Just easier that way.
Chandler  Oh, come on. You told me about the last dream.
Rachel  No, forget it.
Chandler  Oh, why not. Was I doing anything particularly... saucy?
Rachel  All right, fine. Um, you were not the only one there. (Camera fades to
Ross, who's listening very carefully) Joey was there too.
Joey  All right. (Moves closer.)
Ross  Was there...uh, huh, huh, huh... andybody, anybody else there.
Rachel  No.
Ross  You're sure? Nobody uh, handed out uh, mints or anything?
Rachel  No, it was just the three of us.
Ross  Huh!
Joey  So, tell me. Was it like you and Chandler, and then you and me, or you and
me and Chandler?
Rachel  (laughs) You know what?
Joey  What?
Rachel  There were times when it wasn't even me.
Phoebe  That is so sweet, you guys. (hugs them)
Ross, Rachel, and Phoebe  Hey, Mon.
Rachel  Mon, Ethan called again. Mon?
All  (shouting) Mon!
Monica  What?
Rachel  Ethan called again.
Monica  Oh.
Ross  Are you not seeing him anymore?
Monica  No. You know, sometimes just things doesn't work out.
Chandler  And this has nothing to do with the fact that he needs a note to get
out of gym.
Rachel  I, I didn't say any... I sw... I did not say anything, I swear. He
stopped by.
Joey  Listen, the next time you talk to him, can you ask him which one the
strongest Power Ranger is?
Ross  Oh, yeah.
Monica  Ha,ha, ha, oh my life is just so amusing. Could we drop it now?
Joey, Chander, and Ross  Sorry.
Ross  It's morphin time!
Joey  Stegosaurus!
Chandler  Tyrannosaurus!
Phoebe  Ooh, oh, I've gotta go. (raises) Whoa, oh, head rush. One more, and then
I have to go. (sits down, and then raises again) Cool!
Rachel  Where are you going?
Phoebe  Um, oh, I've got a birthday party, with some work people.
Chandler  Work people? Nobody told me.
Phoebe  No, I know. That's a part of the whole, you know,
them-not-liking-you-extravaganza.
Chandler  You know, I don't get this. A month ago, these people were my friends.
You know, just because I'm in charge doesn't mean I'm a different person.
Phoebe  Well, then you should come tonight. You know, just hang out with them.
Let them see what a great guy you still are.
Chandler  You think I should?
Phoebe  I really do, yeah.
Chandler  Okay.
Phoebe  Okay.
Chandler  Okay.
Phoebe  Oh, but, could we not go together? I,I don't wanna be the geek that
invited the boss.
[Scene  Chandler's office, he and Phoebe are taking a break from work.]
Chandler  I Think last night was great. You know, the Karaoke thing. Tracy and I
doing Ebony and Ivory.
Phoebe  You were great. But they still made fun of you.
Chandler  What?
Phoebe  You know, now you're more like, you know like, "Mr. Caring
Boss," "Mr.", you know, "I'm one of you, Boss," "Mr., I
wanna be your buddy, Boss Man Bing!"
Chandler  Then, I don't get it.
Phoebe  Well, you know what Chandler? I think you've gotta face it. You're like,
the guy in the big office, you know. You're the one that hires them, that fires them...
They still say you're a great boss.
Chandler  They do?
Phoebe  Uh huh. But they're not your friends anymore.
Chandler  I just wan't to...
Phoebe  No, but you can't.
Chandler  But I just wa...
Phoebe  Uh uh.
[Scene  Central Perk. Everyone exept Phoebe and Chandler is there. Ross's beeper goes
off and everyone exept him react.]
Monica  Aren't you gonna...
Ross  Oh, Carol and I have a new system. If she punches in 911, it means she's
having a baby, otherwise I just ignore it.
Joey  What about André?
Ross  Oh, well this morning he got a call from who I think was our cousin
Nathan, and frankly, it was a little more than I needed to know.
Young Ethan  Hey.
Monica  That was gonna be my opener.
Rachel  (understands that Monica and Ethan wanna be alone) Hey, did you guys
check out those new hand-dryers in the bathroom?
Ross  I thought that was just a rumour.
Rachel  True story.
Joey  They're here already?
Young Ethan  All right, look. I've gotta tell you something. I'm not 17. I only
said so that you'd think I was cute and vunerable. I'm actually 30, I have a wife, I have
a job, I'm your Congressman. Monica, this is ridiculous, we're great together. We can
talk, we make each other laugh, and the sex. Oh, man, okay i have no frame of graft, but I
thought that was great.
Monica  It was.
Young Ethan  Then, what's the problem?
Monica  Ethan, it's um... it's icky.
Young Ethan  Icky? You're actually gonna throw this away because it's icky?
Monica  This isn't easy for me either. I wish things were different, I... If you
were a few years older, or if I was a few years younger, or if we lived in biblical times,
I would really...
Young Ethan  No, don't say it. (closes Monica's mouth with his hand)
Monica  ...love you.
Ross  Are you're hands still wet?
Joey  Uh, moist, yeah.
Rachel  Let's dry 'em again.
[Scene  A hall on the floor where Chandler works. Chandler and Phoebe enters, and
overhears some employees's conversation. One of them is doing Chandler.]
Gerston  Uh, like, could these margaritas be any stronger?
(They discover that Chandler is listening) Hey, Chandler.
Santos  Hello, Mr. Bing.
Petrie  Loved your Stevie Wonder last night.
Chandler  Thanks. Listen, about the weekly numbers, I'm gonna need them on my
desk by nine o'clock.
Santos  Sure.
Gerston  No problem.
Chandler  You have to give 'em something, you know. Okay, now that was Gerston,
Santos, and who's the guy with the moustache?
Phoebe  Petrie.
Chandler  Petrie, right, right. Okay, some people gonna be working this weekend.
[Scene  Monica and Rachel's, Ross is watching TV, but turns it off, and Rachel is
sleeping on the couch. Ross puts a blanket over her.]
Rachel  (talking in her sleep) Oooooooooh. (Rachel strokes her hand over the
pillow. Ross mimicks her silently) Oh, that's nice. Oh, oh. Huh, Ross!
Rachel  Ross?
Ross  I'm here.
Rachel  You are. Well, um... We, we, we were just...  Wow!
Ross  What? (his beeper goes off) Great, now I'm having a baby.
Rachel  What?
Ross  Ooh, Ooh.
Rachel  What?
Ross  I'm having... I'm having a baby. (jumps back onto the table again) I'm
having a... Where's the phone? The phone?
Rachel  I don't know where the phone is.
Rachel  Ross?
Ross  I'm hurt.
[Scene  The Hallway, Ross is eagerly waiting for the others to get ready, to go to the
hospital.]
Ross  Monica, let's go. Come on now people, woman in labor.
Chandler  (doing a little dance) Hey Ross, look what I've got going here.
Ross  Yeah, save it for the cab, okay.
Ross  What are you doing? We're going to a hospital.
Rachel  What, so I can't lokk nice? There might be doctors there.
Ross  Joey, get out of the fridge.
Joey  All right, all right. (he comes out from their apartment with a huge
sandwich in his hand)
Ross  What is that? (refering to the sandwich)
Joey  For the ride.
Chandler  Yeah, like in a cab...
Ross  Save it.
Chandler  Okay, hating this.
Ross  Monica, come on now. Let's go, baby coming.
Monica  I can't belive it, I'm gonna be an aunt. I'm gonna have like a nephew.
Ross  That's nice. Get out Let's go, come on.
Joey  All right, I'm going. I'm going.
Chandler  Here we go, here we go.
Rachel  Rossy, Rossy.
[Scene  The hospital, Ross, Rachel, Chandler, Joey, and Monica are in the waiting room,
waiting for Carol and Susan to arrive.]
Ross  She's not here yet. She's not here. She's having my baby and she's not
here.
Monica  I'm sure everything's fine. Has her water broke yet?
Ross  I don't know, but when I spoke to her, she said she had already passed the
mucus plug.
Joey  Do we have to know about that?
Monica  Joey, what are you gonna do when you have a baby?
Joey  I'm gonna be in the waitin' room, handing out cigars.
Chandler  Yes, Joey's made arrangements to have his baby in a movie from the
50's.
Ross  God, I don't believe this. She could be giving birth in the cab.
Rachel  Oh, Ross, relax. It's probably like two dollars for the first
contraction, and then fifty cents for each additional contraction.
Rachel  What, it's ok when Chandler does it?
Chandler  You have to pick your moments.
Phoebe  Did I miss it, did I miss it?
Ross  She's not even here yet.
Monica  What's with the guitar?
Phoebe  I just thought we might be here for awhile. You know, things might get
musical.
Ross  (to Carol) Where the hell have you been?
Susan  We stopped at the gift shop.
Carol  I was looking at stuffed animals, and Susan wanted a Chunky.
Ross  Susan wanted a Chunky. We're having a baby, ok, a baby, you don't
stop for Chunkys.
Chandler  I used to have that bumper sticker.
Chandler  (to Rachel) You see what I mean.
[Scene  Carol's Hospital Room, Carol is on the bed, Ross and Susan are at her side.]
Ross  Stopped for a Chunky.
Carol  Let it go, Ross.
Susan  I got an extra one. You want this? (holds the candy in front of Ross'
face)
Ross  (weakly) No.
Dr. Franzblau  Hey, how's my favorite parenting team doing?
Ross  Dr. Franzblau, hi.
Dr. Franzblau  So, I understand you're thinking of having a baby? Well, I see
you're nine months pregnant. That's a good start. How you doing with your contractions?
Carol  Oh, I love them. Each one's like a little party in my uterus.
Susan  They're every four minutes and last 55 seconds.
Ross  59 seconds. (holds up his watch) Quartz, ha.
Susan  Swiss quartz, ha, ha.
Carol  Am I allowed to drink anything?
Dr. Franzblau  Ice chips, just ice chips. They're at the nurses' station.
Ross  I'll get it.
Susan  No, I'm getting it. I'll be right back.
Ross  I got itI'm getting it!
Rachel  Hi, I thought you might like some ice chips.
Carol  Thanks.
Rachel  And if you need anything else, I(notices the handsome Dr.
Franzblau)do not believe we've met. Hi. I'm, uh, Rachel Green. I'm Carol's...
ex-husband's... sister's roommate.
Dr. Franzblau  It is nice to meet you. I'm Dr. Franzblau. I'm your roommate's...
brother's... ex-wife's obstetrician.
Rachel  Oh, that's funny!
[Scene  The Waiting Room, Chandler is falling asleep on Monica's shoulder.]
Monica  I want a baby.
Chandler  Mmmm. Not tonight, honey. I got an early day tomorrow.
Monica  Get up. Come on. Let's get some coffee.
Chandler  Oh, ok, 'cause we never do that.
Joey  (to the screen) Shoot! Shoot! Shoot! Shoot, or just fall down. That's good
too.
Lydia  Knick fan?
Joey  Oh, yeah.
Lydia  Oh, boy, do they suck.
Joey  Hey, listen, lady....(sees that she's pregnant)...whoa.
Lydia  Look, look at your man, Ewing. Nice shot. You know what, he couldn't hit
water if he was standing on a boat.
Joey  Oh yeah? And who do you like?
Lydia  The Celtics.
Joey  The Celtics? Ha. They couldn't hit a boat if...wait. They suck, alright?
Lydia  Oh, shut up. You know, it's a rebuilding year. You... waah!
Joey  Wha? Wha..aa? Let me get the father. Hey, we need a father over here! We
need a father!
Lydia  There is no father.
Joey  Oh, oh, oh, sorry.
Lydia  Ok, that's ok. I'm fine. I'm... oh!
Joey  Oh, uh, ok. Right this way. All the other pregnant women seem to be goin'
in here.
Lydia  Ok.
[Scene  The Waiting Room, Phoebe is playing a song. Chandler, Monica, and Ross are
there as well.]
Phoebe  (singing)
Phoebe  Thanks, Ross.
Ross  Yeah. I'm paying you to stop.
Phoebe  Ok.
Phoebe  Oh, look, twins. Hi, guys. Oh, cute, cute.
Monica  No fair. I don't even have one. How come they get two?
Chandler  You'll get one.
Monica  Oh yeah? When?
Chandler  All right. I'll tell you what. When we're 40, if neither one of us are
married, what do you say you and I get together and have one?
Monica  Why won't I be married when I'm 40?
Chandler  Oh, no, no. I just meant hypothetically.
Monica  Ok, hypothetically, why won't I be married when I'm 40?
Chandler  No, no, no.
Monica  What is it? Is there something fundamentally unmarriable about me?
Chandler  (trapped) Uh, uh.
Monica  Well?
Chandler  Dear God! This parachute is a knapsack! (throws himself over the back
of the chair he was sitting in)
Rachel  Hey.
Phoebe  Hey. Ooh, look at you, dressy-dress.
Monica  Did you go home and change?
Rachel  Yeah, well, it's an important day. I wanna look nice. Um, has uh Dr.
Franzblau been by?
Monica  No, I haven't seen him.
Rachel  Well, where is he? He is supposed to be here. (Pause) What if the baby
needs him?
Chandler  Rachel, what is the deal with you and doctors, anyway? Was, like, your
father a doctor?
Rachel  Yeah, why?
Chandler  No reason. (turns around, makes an 'Oh my God' gesture with his eyes)
[Scene  Joey and Lydia in the hospital room. Lydia is on the phone with her mother.]
Lydia  Mom, we've been through this. No, I'm not calling him. I don't care if it
is his kid, the guy's a jerk. No, I'm not alone. Joey's here. (pause) What do you mean,
Joey who? (covers the phone, to Joey) Joey who?
Joey  Tribbiani.
Lydia  Joey Tribbiani. Yes, ok. Hold on. (to Joey) She wants to talk to you.
Take the phone.
Joey  (takes phone) Hi, yeah, it's me. (Listens) Oh, no no no, we're just
friends. (Listens) Yeah, I'm single. (Listens) 25. (Listens) An actor. (Listens) Hello?
Lydia  She's not much of a phone person.
Joey  Yeah, so, uh, so, uh, what's the deal with this father guy, I mean, if
someone was havin' my baby somewhere, I'd wanna know about it, you know?
Lydia  Hey, Knick fan, am I interested in your views on fatherhood? Uh, no.
Joey  Ok, look, maybe I should just go.
Lydia  Maybe you should.
Joey  Good luck, and uh, take care, huh?
Joey  You know what the Celtics problem is? They let the players run the team.
Lydia  Oh, that is so not true.
Joey  Oh, it is.
Lydia  It isn't.
Joey  It is.
Lydia  Isn't!
[Scene  Carol's Hospital Room, Ross and Susan are coaching Carol.]
Ross  Breathe.
Susan  Breathe.
Ross  Breathe.
Susan  Breathe.
Ross  Breathe.
Susan  Breathe.
Carol  You're gonna kill me!
Ross  15 more seconds, 14, 13, 12...
Carol  Count faster.
Susan  It's gonna be ok, just remember, we're doing this for Jordie. Just keep
focusing on Jordie.
Ross  Who the hell is Jordie?
Susan  Your son.
Ross  No-no-no. I don't have a son named Jordie. We all agreed, my son's name is
Jamie.
Carol  Well, Jamie was the name of Susan's first girlfriend, so we went back to
Jordie.
Ross  What? Whoa, whoa whoa whoa, what do you mean, back to Jordie? We
never landed on Jordie. We just passed by it during the whole Jessy, Cody, Dylan
fiasco.
Carol  Ow, ow, ow, ow, leg cramp, leg cramp, leg cramp.
Ross  I got it.
Susan  I got it.
Ross  I got it! Hey, you get to sleep with her, I get the cramps.
Susan  No, you don't.
Carol  All right, that's it. I want both of you out.
Ross  Why?
Susan  He started it!
Ross  No, you started it.
Susan  You did!
Carol  I don't care. I am trying to get a person out of my body here, and you're
not making it any easier.
Ross  But...
Carol  Now go!
Ross  (to Susan) Thanks a lot.
Susan  (to Ross) See what you did.
Ross  (to Carol) Yeah, listen...
Carol  Out!
[Scene  Lydia's Hospital Room, Joey is helping Lydia go through labor, a nurse is now
present in her room as well.]
Nurse  Breathe, breathe, breathe...
Lydia  Oh, no.
Joey  Ew! What is that? Something exploded!
Nurse  It's just her water breaking. Calm down, will you?
Joey  (panicked) Water breaking, what do you mean? What's that, water breaking?
Nurse  (to Joey) Breathe, breathe, breathe.
[Scene  The Hall, Ross and Susan are arguing.]
Ross  Please. This is so your fault.
Susan  How, how is this my fault?
Ross  Look, Carol never threw me out of a room before you came along.
Susan  Yeah? Well, there's a lot of things Carol never did before I came along.
Ross  You tryin' to be clever? A funny lady?
Susan  You know what your problem is? You're threatened by me.
Ross  Oh, I'm threatened by you?
Susan  Yes.
Phoebe  Hey, hey, ok, all right, that's it! Get in here. Come on. My god, you
guys, I don't believe you. There are children coming into the world in this very building
and your negative fighting noises are not the first thing they should be hearing. So just
stop all the yelling, just stop it!
Ross  Yeah, Susan.
Phoebe  Don't make me do this again, I don't like my voice like this.
Phoebe  Ok, who wants to hear something ironic?
[Scene  The Broom Closet, Ross and Susan are trying to get out.]
All  Help!
Ross  I'm having a baby in here! Ok, everyone stand back. (Walks backwards as if
he is going to break down the door, but steps in a bucket and falls) Ow.
[Scene  Carol's room, Rachel and Dr. Franzblau are there with her.]
Carol  Are they here yet?
Rachel  No, honey, they're not, but don't worry, because we are going to find
them, and until we do, we are all here for you, ok?
Carol  Ok.
Rachel  Ok?
Carol  Ok.
Rachel  (to Dr. Franzblau) Ok, so anyway, you were telling me about Paris, it
sounds fascinating.
Dr. Franzblau  It really was. There was this great little pastry shop right by
my hotel. (Carol sits up in pain, Rachel and Dr. Franzblau casually lay her back down)
There you go, dear.
[Scene  Lydia's Room, Joey is helping her deliver.]
Joey  Come on, Lydia, you can do it. Push! Push 'em out, push 'em out, harder,
harder. Push 'em out, push 'em out, way out! Let's get that ball and really move, hey,
hey, ho, ho. Let's (notices the nurse looking at him strangely) I was
justyeah, right. Push! Push!
[Scene  The Broom Closet, Ross has picked up a vacuum and is holding it at the door.]
Susan  What're you gonna do, suck the door open?
Ross  Help! Help!
Phoebe  (singing) They found their bodies the very next day, they found their
bodies the very next...(sees Ross and Susan staring at her) la la la la la la.
Susan and Ross  (even louder) Help!
[Scene  The Waiting Room, Monica is on the phone with her mother, Chandler is standing
behind her.]
Monica  Now, Mom, everything's going fine, really. (Listens) Yeah, Ross is
great. He's uh, he's in a whole other place. (Listens) No, he's gone. (Listens) No no, you
don't have to fly back, really. (Listens) What do you mean this might be your only chance?
(Listens) Would you stop? I'm only 26, I'm not even thinking about babies yet.
Chandler  Where have you been?
Joey  Oh, just had a baby.
Chandler  Mazel tov!
[Scene  The Waiting Room, Rachel and Dr. Franzblau have gone to get coffee.]
Dr. Franzblau  I don't know, could be an hour, could be three, but relax, she's
doing great. So, uh, tell me, are you currently involved with anyone?
Rachel  (anxiously) No, no, not at the moment, no, I'm not. Are you?
Dr. Franzblau  No, it's hard enough to get women to go out with me.
Rachel  Right, yeah, I've heard that about cute doctors.
Dr. Franzblau  No, no, really. I suppose it's because I spend so much time, you
know, where I do.
Rachel  Oh.
Dr. Franzblau  I try not to let my work affect my personal life, but it's hard,
when you... do what I do. It's like uh...Well, for instance, what do you do?
Rachel  I'm a waitress.
Dr. Franzblau  Ok, all right, well aren't there times when you come home at the
end of the day, and you're just like, 'if I see one more cup of coffee'...
Rachel  (getting the point) Yeah. Gotcha.
Dr. Franzblau  I'm gonna go check up on your friend.
Rachel  Ok. That's fine. (takes her earrings out)
[Scene  The Hall Outside Lydia's Room, Joey is walking up to Lydia's room with
balloons, but before he enters he sees that the baby's father has arrived. He listens at
the door.]
Lydia  So how did you know I was even here?
Guy  Your mom called me. So is this her?
Lydia  No, this is a loaner.
Guy  I'm sorry you had to do this by yourself.
Lydia  I wasn't by myself. I had a doctor, a nurse, and a helper guy. (Joey
smiles) So, did you see who won the game?
Guy  Yeah, the Knicks by 10. They suck.
Lydia  Yeah, they're not so bad.
[Scene  The Broom Closet, Ross is trying to open the door with a credit card, with no
success.]
Ross  Come on, come on. Damnit, damnit, damnit, damnit. (to Susan) This is all
your fault. This is supposed to be, like, the greatest day of my life, y'know? My son is
being born, and I should be in there, you know, instead of stuck in a closet with you.
Susan  The woman I love is having a baby today. I've been waiting for this just
as much as you have.
Ross  No no no, believe me. No one has been waiting for this as much as I have,
ok? And you know what the funny thing is? When this day is over, you get to go home with
the baby, ok? Where does that leave me?
Susan  You get to be the baby's father. Everyone knows who you are. Who am I?
There's Mother's Day, there's Father's Day, there's no... Lesbian Lover Day.
Ross  Every day is Lesbian Lover Day.
Phoebe  This is so great.
Ross  You wanna explain that?
Phoebe  I mean, well, 'cause when I was growing up, you know my dad left, and my
mother died, and my stepfather went to jail, so I barely had enough pieces of parents to
make one whole one. And here's this little baby who has like three whole parents who care
about it so much that they're fighting over who gets to love it the most. And it's not
even born yet. It's just, it's just the luckiest baby in the whole world. (pause) I'm
sorry, you were fighting.
[Scene  Carol's Room, she is ready to give birth. Everyone is there except for Phoebe,
Ross, and Susan, who are in the broom closet.]
Carol  Where are they?
Monica  I'm sure they'll be here soon.
Rachel  Yeah, honey, they wouldn't miss this.
Joey  Relax. You're only at nine centimeters. And the baby's at zero station.
Chandler  (to Joey) You are really frightening me.
Chandler  Somebody wanna help me, tryin' to rip out my heart. (they pull her
hand off of him) Uh, that's great. (looking around) Anybody seen a nipple?
Dr. Franzblau  All right, ten centimeters, here we go.
Nurse  All right, honey, time to start pushing.
Carol  But they're not here yet!
Dr. Franzblau  I'm sorry, I can't tell the baby to wait for them.
Carol  Oh, god.
[Scene  The Broom Closet, Ross has used a broom to open the air vent in the ceiling.
Phoebe is wearing a janitor's uniform, ready to go up in the vent.]
Ross  Ok, got the vent open.
Phoebe  (reading the nametag on the uniform) Hi, I'm Ben. I'm hospital worker
Ben. It's Ben... to the rescue!
Ross  Ben, you ready? All right, gimme your foot. Ok, on three, Ben. One, two,
three. Ok, That's it, Ben.
Susan  What do you see?
Phoebe  Well, Susan, I see what appears to be a dark vent. Wait. Yes, it is in
fact a dark vent.
Ross  Phoebs, It's open! It's open!
Janitor  (to Ross and Susan) Wait! You forgot your legs!
[Scene  Carol's Room, Ross and Susan rush in.]
All  Push, push!
Ross  We're here!
Carol  (irked) Where have you been?
Ross  Long story, honey.
Dr. Franzblau  All right, Carol, I need you to keep pushing. I
need(reaches for an instrument, Rachel's hand is on it) Excuse me, could I have
this?
Nurse  All right, all right, there's a few too many people in this room, and
there's about to be one more, so anybody who's not an ex-husband or a lesbian life
partner, out you go!
All  Good luck!
Chandler  (to nurse) Let me ask you, do you have to be Carol's lesbian life
partner?
Nurse  Out!
Dr. Franzblau  All right, he's crowning. Here he comes.
Ross  Let me see, I gotta see, I gotta see. Oh, a head. Oh, it's, it's huge.
Carol, how are you doing this?
Carol  (straining) Not.... helping!
Dr. Franzblau  You're doing great, you're doing fine.
Ross  (puts his head near the baby) Hello! (to Dr. Franzblau) Oh, sorry.
Susan  What do you see? What do you see?
Ross  We got a head, we got shoulders, we got arms, we got, oh, look at the
little fingers, oh, and a chest, and a stomach. It's a boy, definitely a boy! All right!
Ok, legs, knees, and feet. Oh, oh. He's here. He's a person.
Susan  Oh, look at that.
Carol  What does he look like?
Ross  Kinda like my uncle Ed, covered in Jell-o.
Carol  Really?
Phoebe  (from the air vent overhead) You guys, he's beautiful!
Ross  Oh, thanks, Pheebs!
[Scene  The Delivery Room, Carol is holding the infant.]
Susan  No shouting, but we still need a name for this little guy.
Ross  (thinking) How 'bout Ben?
Susan  I like Ben.
Carol  Ben. Ben. Ben's good. How come you never mentioned Ben before?
Ross  We uh, we just cooked it up.
Susan  That's what we were off doing.
Monica  Hi.
Ross  Hey.
Monica  Can we come in?
Ross  (to Ben) I know, I know. Everybody, there's someone I'd like you to meet.
Yeah. This is Ben. Ben, this is everybody.
Phoebe  Susan, he looks just like you.
Susan  Thanks.
Rachel  Oh, god, I can't believe one of us actually has one of these.
Chandler  I know, I still am one of these.
Monica  Ross, can I?
Ross  The head, the head. You gotta...
Monica  (getting choked up) Hi, Ben. Hi. I'm your Aunt Monica. Yes I am. I'm
your Aunt Monica. I...I will always have gum.
[Scene  The Hospital, the camera is placed as though it were Ben's eyes.]
Ross  Ben, I want you to know that there may be some times when I may not be
around, like this. (walks out of the picture) But I'll still always come back, like this.
(returns) And sometimes I may be away longer, like this. (walks away) But I'll still
always come back, like this. (returns)
Chandler  And sometimes, I'll want you to steal third, and I'll go like this.
(Does a baseball sign.)
Monica  He is so amazing.
Rachel  Oh, I know. Look at him.
Joey  Ben, Ben, hey Ben. Nothing. I don't think that's his name.
Phoebe  Oh, look, look, he's closing his eyes. (screen goes blank) Look, he's
opening his eyes. (picture comes back)
Joey  He doesn't do much, does he?
Ross  No, this is pretty much it.
Rachel  You guys wanna get some coffee?
All  Yeah.
Ross  All right, I'll see you guys later.
Phoebe  Oh, look, he's closing his eyes again.
[Scene  Central Perk, the whole gang is there, Ross is showing pictures of his new baby
boy, Ben, to the group.]
Ross  And here's little Ben nodding off...
Monica  Awww, look at Aunt Monica's little boy!
Phoebe  Oh, look, he's got Ross's haircut!
Rachel  Oh, let me see! (grabs picture) Oh, God, is he just the sweetest thing?
You must just want to kiss him all over!
Ross  (quietly) That would be nice.
Rachel  Pardon?
Chandler  Nothing, just a little extra air in my mouth. Pffft. Pffffffft. (walks
over to where Joey is seated)
Joey  Hey, Chan, can you help me out here? I promise I'll pay you back.
Chandler  Oh, yeah, right, OK... inlcuding the waffles last week, you now owe
me... 17 jillion dollars.
Joey  I will, really. I'll pay you back this time.
Chandler  (sigh)... And where's this money coming from? (gives money to Joey)
Joey  Well... I'm helping out down at the N.Y.U. Med School with some...
research.
Ross  (overhearing) What kind of research?
Joey  Oh, just, y'know.... science.
Ross  Science. Yeah, I think I've heard of that. (everyone's interest is piqued,
they all look over)
Joey  (sigh)... It's a fertility study.
Monica  Oh, Joey, please tell me you're only donating your time.
Joey  Alright, come on you guys, it's not that big a deal. Really... I mean, I
just go down there every other day and... make my contribution to the project. Hey, hey,
but at the end of two weeks, I get seven hundred dollars.
Ross  Hey.
Phoebe  Wow, ooh, you're gonna be making money hand over fist!
[Scene  Monica and Rachel's, Monica and Phoebe are preparing for a barbecue for
Rachel's birthday.]
Monica  OK, we got the cole slaw, we got the buns...
Phoebe  We've got the ground-up flesh of formerly cute cows and turkeys, ew...
(hands meat to Monica)
Chandler  (in a deep voice) Men are here.
Joey  We make fire. Cook meat.
Chandler  Then put out fire by peeing, no get invited back.
Monica and Phoebe  Ewww!
Monica  Oh Joey, Melanie called, said she's gonna be late.
Joey  Oh, OK.
Phoebe  So how are things going with you two? Is she becoming your
(provocatively) special someone?
Joey  I don't know, she's, uh.... she's pretty great.
Monica  Yeah? What does she think of your little science project?
Joey  What, you think I'm gonna tell a girl I like that I'm also seeing a cup?
Monica  Man's got a point.
Joey  Well, the tough thing is, she really wants to have sex with me.
Chandler  Crazy bitch.
Joey  Yeah, well, I still got a week left to go in the program, and according to
the rules, if I want to get the money I'm not allowed to conduct any... ersonal
experiments, if you know what I mean.
Monica  Joey... we always know what you mean.
Phoebe  Hey.
Monica  Hey.
Ross  Hey. (Phoebe sees his bags)
Phoebe  How long did you think this barbecue was gonna last?
Ross  I'm going to China.
Phoebe  Jeez, you say one thing, and...
Monica  You're going to China?
Ross  Yeah, i-it's for the museum. Someone found a bone, we want the bone, but
they don't want us to have the bone, so I'm going over there to try to persuade them to
give us the boit'sit's a whole big bone thing. Anyway, I'm gonna be gone for
like, uh... like a week, so, uh, if you wanna reach me, y-you can't. So here's my
itinerary (hands a sheet of paper to Monica). Um... here's a picture of me... (hands it to
Monica)
Phoebe  Oh, let me see! (takes the picture)
Monica  Yeah.
Phoebe  Hi, Ben. I'm your father. I am... the head. Aaaaaahhhh.... (puts picture
down, sees Ross staring at her) Alright, this barbecue is gonna be very fun.
Ross  Hey, is Rachel here? Um, I wanted to wish her a happy birthday before I
left.
Monica  Oh no, she's out having drinks with Carl.
Ross  Oh. (pause) Hey, who's Carl?
Monica  You know, that guy she met at the coffeehouse.
Ross  No.
Phoebe  Oh, well, see, there's this guy she met at the...
Ross  At the coffeehouse, right.
Phoebe  So you do know who he is! (laughs, Ross stares at her) Sorry.
Ross  OK, I'm gonna go say goodbye to the guys.
Phoebe  Oh, hey, y'know what? Tell them that bone story.
Ross  Hi.
Joey  Hey!
Chandler  Hey!
Ross  (sigh)....I have to go to China.
Joey  The country?
Ross  No no, this big pile of dishes in my mom's breakfront. Do you guys know
who Carl is?
Chandler  Uh, let's see... Alvin... Simon... Theodore.... no.
Ross  Well, Rachel's having drinks with him tonight.
Joey  Oh no! How can she do that when she's never shown any interest in you?!?
Chandler  Forget about her.
Joey  He's right, man. Please. Move on. Go to China. Eat Chinese food.
Chandler  Course there, they just call it food.
Ross  Yeah... I guess. I don'tI don't know. Alright, just... just give her
this for me, OK? (gives Chandler a gift for Rachel)
Joey  Listen, buddy, we're just looking out for you.
Ross  I know.
Joey  We want you to be happy. And I may only have a couple beers in me, but...
I love you, man. (Joey gives Ross a hug)
Chandler  I'm still on my first. I just think you're nice.
Melanie  Anyway, that's when me and my friends started this whole fruit basket
business. We call ourselves 'The Three Basketeers.'
Joey  Like the three musketeers, only with fruit.
Chandler  (sarcastic) Ooooh. (looks dumbfounded at Joey's stupidity)
Monica  (gets up) OK, how does everybody like their burgers?
Rachel  Oh, no, no, no. Presents first. Food later. (walks into living room)
Monica  Hey, hold on there, tiger. How's it going? How you holding up?
Joey  Well, not so good. She definitely thinks tonight is the night we're
gonna... complete the transaction, if you know what I...
Joey  Then you do. Heh, heh.
Monica  So, uh, have you ever thought about being there for her?
Joey  What do you mean?
Monica  Y'know, just be there for her.
Joey  Not following you.
Monica  Think about it.
Rachel  OK, I'm guessing this is from...
Rachel  Well, thank you, Melanie.
Chandler  (pointing out a gift) OK, this one right here is from me.
Rachel  (picks it up) OK... ah, it's light... (shakes it)...it rattles...
it's... (opens it) Travel Scrabble! Oooohhh, thank you! (she gives it back to him)
Rachel  This one's from Joey... feels like a book. Thinks it's a book... feels
like a book. And...(opens it)...it's a book!
Phoebe  Oh, it's Dr. Seuss!
Melanie  There is a little child inside this man!
Chandler  Yes, the doctors say if they remove it, he'll die.
Rachel  Who's this from?
Chandler  Oh, that's Ross's.
Rachel  Oh... (opens it)... (sees it is a pin) Oh my God. He remembered.
Phoebe  Remembered what?
Rachel  It was like months ago. We were walking by this antique store, and I saw
this pin in the window, and I told him it was just like one my grandmother had when I was
a little girl. Oh! I can't believe he remembered!
Chandler  Well, sure, but can you play it on a plane? (pats his Travel
Scrabble game)
Phoebe  Oh, it's so pretty. This must have cost him a fortune.
Monica  I can't believe he did this.
Chandler  Come on, Ross? Remember back in college, when he fell in love with
Carol and bought her that ridiculously expensive crystal duck?
Rachel  What did you just say?
Chandler  (panicked) ahem... um... Crystal duck.
Rachel  No, no, no.... the, um, the... 'love' part?
Chandler  (stuttering incoherently) F-hah.... flennin....
Rachel  Oh.... my God.
Chandler  (rubbing his temples) Oh, no-no-no-no-no....
Joey  (pats Chandler on the leg) That's good, just keep rubbing your head.
That'll turn back time.
[Scene  Monica and Rachel's, continued from earlier.]
Rachel  I mean, this is unbelievable.
Phoebe  I know. This is really, really huge.
Chandler  No it's not. It's small. It's tiny. It's petite. It's wee.
Phoebe  Nuh-uh. I don't think any of our lives are ever gonna be the same ever
again.
Chandler  OK, is there a mute button on this woman?
Monica  I think this is so great! I mean, you and Ross! D-did you have any idea?
Joey  Well, given that he's desperately in love with you, he probably wouldn't
mind getting a cup of coffee or something.
Rachel  Ross? All this time? Well, I've got to talk to him. (gets up to leave)
Chandler  (quickly) H-He's in China!
Joey  The country.
Monica  No, no, wait. (checks Ross's itinerary) His flight doesn't leave for
another forty-five more minutes.
Chandler  What about the time difference?
Monica  From here to the airport?
Chandler  Yes! (Rachel walks towards door) You're never gonna make it!
Monica  Rachel, what're you gonna say to him?
Rachel  I-I-I don't know.
Chandler  Well then maybe you shouldn't go.
Joey  He's right, cause if you're just gonna, like, break his heart, that's the
kind of thing that can wait.
Monica  Yeah, but if it's good news, you should tell him now.
Rachel  I don't know. Maybe I'll know when I see him.
Phoebe  Here, look, alright, does this help?
Rachel  Noooo... look, all I know is that I cannot wait a week until I see him.
I mean, this is just too big. Y'know, I just, I've just gotta talk to him. I... I gotta...
OK, I'll see you later. (opens door)
Chandler  Rachel, I love you! Deal with me first! (she leaves)
[Scene  Airport, Ross has headphones on, and is listening to a 'How To Speak Chinese'
tape. Occasionally, he makes an outburst in Chinese in accordance with the tape. He is
getting on the jetway. The flight attendant is there.]
Ross  (something in Chinese)
Flight Attendant  Alright!
Ross  Ni-chou chi-ma! (walks onto jetway)
Rachel  Ross! Excuse me, pardon me, excuse me....
Flight Attendant  Hi!
Rachel  Hi.
Flight Attendant  May I see your boarding pass?
Rachel  Oh, no, no, I don't have one. I just need to talk to my friend.
Flight Attendant  Oh, oooh. I'm sorry. You are not allowed on the jetway unless
you have a boarding pass.
Rachel  No, I know, but Ihe just went on. He's right there, he's got the
blue jacket on, I... can I j-just...
Flight Attendant  No no no! Federal regulations!
Rachel  OK, alright, OK, um... then could you please, uh... just give him a
message for me? Please? This is very important.
Flight Attendant  Alright. What's the message?
Rachel  Uh... I don't know.
Flight Attendant  Sir? Sir? Excuse me, sir? Uh... I have a message for you.
Man  (confused) What?
Flight Attendant  It's from Rachel. She said that she loved the present, and she
will see you when you get back.
[Scene  Joey's Bedroom, he and Melanie are in bed together.]
Melanie  Mmmmmm... Oh, Joey, Joey, Joey... I think I blacked out there for a
minute!
Joey  Heh, heh. It was nothin'.
Melanie  Well, now we've gotta find something fun for you! (she starts kissing
his chest)
Joey  (panicked) Uhhh.. y'know what? Forget about me. Let's, uh... let's give
you another turn.
Melanie  (surprised) M-Me again?
Joey  Sure! Why not?
Melanie  Boy, somebody's gonna get a big fruit basket tomorrow.
Melanie  Oooh, I gotta tell you... you are nothing like I thought you would be.
Joey  How do you mean?
Melanie  I don't know, I-I guess I just had you pegged as one of those guys
who're always 'me, me, me.' But you... you're a giver. You're like the most generous man I
ever met. I mean... you're practically a woman.
[Scene  Monica and Rachel's, Monica, Phoebe, and Rachel are there. Monica is holding
the wrapping paper from one of Rachel's gifts.]
Monica  Uh, so, uh, Rach, uh... do you wanna save this wrapping paper, I mean,
it's only a little bit torn... so are you gonna go for it with Ross or should I just throw
it out?
Rachel  I don't know. I don't know... I thought about it all the way there, and
I thought about it all the way back... and, uh, oh, you guys, y'know, it's Ross.
Y'know what I mean? I mean, it's Ross.
Monica and Phoebe  Sure.
Rachel  I don't know, I mean, this is just my initial gut feeling... but I'm
thinking... oh, I'm thinking it'd be really great.
Monica  Oh my God, me too! Oh! Oh, we'd be like friends-in-law! Y'know what the
best part is? The best part is that you already know everything about him! I mean, it's
like starting on the fifteenth date!
Phoebe  Yeah, but, y'know, it's... it would be like starting on the fifteenth
date.
Monica  Another good point.
Phoebe  No, I mean, I mean, when you're at the fifteenth date, y'know, you're
already in a very relationshippy place. Y'know, it's... you're committed.
Rachel  (confused) Huh?
Phoebe  Well, I mean, then what happens if it doesn't work out?
Monica  Why isn't it working out?
Rachel  I don't know... sometimes it doesn't.
Monica  Is he not cute enough for you?
Rachel  No!
Monica  Does he not make enough money?
Rachel  No, I'm just....
Phoebe  Maybe there's someone else.
Rachel  Wha...
Monica  Is there? Is there someone else?
Rachel  No! There is.. there is noone else!
Monica  Then why the hell are you dumping my brother?!?
[Scene  Chandler and Joey's, Chandler is eating breakfast, Joey quietly opens his
bedroom door.]
Chandler  Hey, big...
Joey  Shhhh!
Chandler  (quietly) ...spender.
Joey  She's still asleep.
Chandler  So how'd it go?
Joey  Oh, it was amazing. You know how you always think you're great in bed?
Chandler  The fact that you'd even ask that question shows how little you know
me.
Joey  Well, it's like, last night, I couldn't do the thing that usually makes me
great. So I had to do all this other stuff. And the response I got... man, oh man, it was
like a ticker tape parade!
Chandler  Yes, I know, as it happens my room is very very close to the parade
route.
Joey  It was amazing! And not just for her... uh-uh. For me, too. It's like, all
of a sudden, I'm blind. But all my other senses are heightened, y'know? It's like... I was
able to appreciate it on another level.
Chandler  I didn't know you had another level.
Joey  I know! Neither did I!
[Scene  Monica and Rachel's, one week later. Monica is seated, Rachel comes out of her
bedroom.]
Monica  Hey, great skirt! Birthday present?
Rachel  Yeah.
Monica  Oh, from who?
Rachel  From you. I exchanged the blouse you got me.
Monica  Well, it's the thought. Hey, doesn't Ross's flight get in in a couple
hours? At gate 27-B?
Rachel  Uh, yeah. Uh, Monica, y'know, honey, I've been thinking about it and
I've decided thisthis whole Ross thing, it's just not a good idea.
Monica  Oh, why?
Rachel  Because, I feel like I wouldn't just be going out with him. I would be
going out with all of you. Oh, and there would just be all this pressure, and I don't
wanna...
Monica  (gets up) No, no, no, no, no, no pressure, no pressure!
Rachel  Monica, nothing has even happened yet, and you're already so...
Monica  I am not 'so'! OK, I was a teensy bit weird at first, but... I'll be
good. I promise.
Rachel  Who is it?
Intercom  It's me, Carl.
Rachel  C'mon up.
Monica  Behind my brother's back? (Rachel glares at her) ... is exactly the kind
of crazy thing you won't be hearing from me.
[Scene  Chandler and Joey's, Chandler is seated, and the apartment is filled with
baskets of fruit. Joey enters, check in hand.]
Joey  Seven hundred bucks!
Chandler  Alright, you did it! Do we have any fruit?
Joey  Man, hell of a two weeks, huh? Y'know what, though? I really feel like I
learned something.
Chandler  Really? So, you're gonna stick with this 'it's all for her' thing?
Joey  What, are you crazy? When a blind man gets his sight back, does he walk
around like this? (Joey closes his eyes and walks around with arms spread.)
[Scene  Monica and Rachel's Balcony, Rachel is having drinks with her date, Carl.]
Carl  I'm just sayin', if I see one more picture of Ed Begley, Jr. in that stupid
electric car, I'm gonna shoot myself! I mean, don't get me wrong... I'm not against
environmental issues per se.... it's just that guy!
Ross  I can't believe you'd rather go out with him than me.
Rachel  Would you excuse me, please? I'm trying to have a date here.
Ross  Fine, just stop thinking about me.
Ross  Can't do it, can you?
Rachel  So I'm thinking about you. So what?
Ross  I don't get it. What do you see in this guy, anyway?
Rachel  Well... he happens to be a very nice... guy....
Carl  I mean, come on, buddy, get a real car!
Ross  Rachel, come on. Give us a chance.
Rachel  Ross, it's too hard.
Ross  No, no, no... why, because it might get weird for everyone else? Who cares
about them. This is about us. Look, I-I've been in love with you since, like, the ninth
grade.
Rachel  Ross, you're like my best friend.
Ross  I know.
Rachel  If we broke up, and I lost you...
Ross  Whoa, whoa, whoa. What makes you think we're gonna break up?
Rachel  Well, have you been involved with someone where you haven't broken up?
Ross  (pause) No. But... it only has to happen once. Look, you and I both
know we are perfect for each other, right? I mean... so, the only question is... are you
attracted to me?
Rachel  I don't know... I mean, I've never looked at you that way before.
Ross  Well, start looking.
Rachel  Wow.
Carl  Exactly! And you just know I'm gonna be the guy caught behind this
hammerhead in traffic!
Rachel  Right! You're right!
Carl  Heh... y'know?
Rachel  You know what?
Carl  What?
Rachel  I forgot... I am supposed to pick up a friend at the airport. I am so
sorry! I'm so... if you want to stay, and finish your drinks, please do.... (gives him her
drink) I meanI'm sorry. I-I-I gotta go. I'm sorry.
Carl  But...
[Scene  Airport. Madonna's Take A Bow plays in the background as Rachel waits at
the gate with flowers.]
Rachel  (sifting through crowd) Excuse me, pardon me, excuse me, excuse me,
sorry. Hi.
Man  For God's sake, will you let it go? There's no Rachel!
Ross  Oh, hey, hey, I got that.
Julie  Oh, thanks, sweetie.
Ross  No problem. I cannot wait for you to meet my friends.
Julie  Really?
Ross  Yeah.
Julie  You don't think they'll judge and ridicule me?
Ross  No, no, they will. I just... uh...
Ross and Julie  Can't wait.
Ross  Come on, they're gonna love you.
