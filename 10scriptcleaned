[Scene  Barbados, Monica and Chandler's Room. They both enter from Ross's
  room. Monica still has her big, frizzy hair.]
Monica  Oh, the way you crushed Mike at ping pong was such
  a turn-on.You wanna...? (plays with her finger on Chandlers chest)
Chandler  You know, I'd love to, but I'm a little tired.
Monica  I'll put a pillowcase over my head.
Chandler  You're on!
Phoebe  Hey!
Monica  What's up?
Phoebe  Well, okay, Mike's taking a shower, which by the
  way there's  no law against. And then we're gonna grab some food, so if you
  want...
Ross  ... finally...
Phoebe  Is that Ross?
Monica  Yeah, you can hear everything through these stupid
  walls.
Phoebe  Sounds like he's with someone.
Chandler  He could be alone. This morning I heard him do
  push-ups, and then talk to his triceps.
Monica  Wait a minute, I think Phoebe's right. You know I
  hear someone else in there with him.
Charlie  Ooh... Dr. Geller!
Ross  God, you're amazing... I didn't even have to ask you
  to call me that.
Monica  Oh my God, that's Charlie!
Chandler  She's cheating on Joey with Ross!
Phoebe  Oh that tart... floozy... giant...
Monica  I'm not sure about this.
Phoebe  Yeah, you're right. This is none of our business.
Monica  No I'm not sure that it's  the best way to hear
  everything. Someone get me a glass!
Phoebe  Oh, I'm not gonna do this, okay? I'm not gonna eavesdrop
  on my friend.
Rachel  (through wall) Ooh... I love Barbados!
Joey  Ooh... I can't believe I'm kissing you. I'm
    kissing Rachel!
Rachel  I know, I'm her!
Phoebe  (whispering) Rachel and Joey! It's Rachel and Joey!!!
Monica  What?
Phoebe  Get over here!
Rachel  ooh...
Chandler  Wow!
Monica  (in her Monica-excited-way... TOO LOUD!) Oh my God,
  I love how thin these walls are!
Monica  (muffled) Thank you.
Rachel  Hey, you know, before you said
    that nothing could happen between us? What changed?
Joey  Well, I only said that because of Ross, you know. Then
  I saw him kissing Charlie...
Rachel  What? Ross and Charlie? (Joey nods) Wow! She's really
  making her way through the group, huh? Ah, who am I to talk?
Monica  I can't believe this. Rachel and Joey?
Chandler  How about the dinosaur twins in the other room?
  No-one is manning that wall!
Monica  I'm on it!
Chandler  Anything?
Monica  I think I hear curtains closing...
Phoebe  We've got shoes being kicked off over here.
Monica  Bedsprings, unmistakable!
Chandler  You do realise  that's your brother?
Monica  Not until you said it. Somebody switch! (Chandler
  makes a clicking sound with his fingers and Phoebe runs to the other wall.
  Monica returns to Chandlers wall.) Wait a minute... Ross and Charlie, Joey
  and Rachel, Phoebe and Mike! We're the only people  leaving with the
  same person we came with.
Chandler  That's not true. I came with Monica and I'm leaving
  with Weird Al.
Monica  Okay, I've had it with the hair jokes. Tomorrow morning,
  before we leave, I'm going to the salon.
Chandler  Okay Buckwheat!
Phoebe  You gotta hear this, it's great... It's like free
  porn! (Chandler eagerly rushes over)
Ross  Weh...*sigh*
Charlie  uhm... Is everything okay?
Ross  Yeah, It's just... I don't think I can do this...
Charlie  Ooh... Is it because of what might be on the bedspread,
  because I saw that news report too, with the infra red and the ... I could
  just...
Ross  No, NO! (they're moving to the side of the bed, where
  they sit down) Look, I need to talk to Joey. I mean, you guys just broke up.
  Before anything more happens between us, I need to know he's okay with it.
Charlie  I uhm... I completely understand.
Ross  Alright, I'm gonna go find them... (twitches a bit,
  looks down) I just need a... need a before I can... you know. (gestures standing
  up... they sit and wait for a while) Grandma... grandma... grandma... (he tries
  to concentrate...) Okay, I see you later.
Charlie  Okay...
Phoebe  That's the door. He's gone...
Chandler  And she's... turning on the TV... and watching...
  Miss Congeniality!
Monica  Honey, if you know it through a wall, you know it
  too well!
Ross  Hey, what are you guys doing?
Phoebe  Oh, we're just... we're sad to go so we're just saying
  goodbye to the hotel. (hugs the wall) I love you... Paradise Hotel, Golf resort
  and Spa... (she walks away from the wall)
Monica  (also hugs the wall) Yeah, we had a great time, thank
  you! (walks to Phoebe)
Chandler  (caresses the wall with his finger) Bye!
Ross  Okay, uhm... Hey, you guys seen Joey anywhere?
Chandler  He's probably in his room with his current girlfriend
  Charlie. That's the situation as we know it... (walks to Phoebe and Monica)
Ross  Well, if you see him could you please tell
  him I'm looking for him?
Chandler  You got it!
Ross  Thanks! (walks out of the room and starts hugging the
  wall) Thank you! (closes the door)
Monica  Other wall, people! Other wall!
Ross  (knocks on door) Rach,  you there? (Joey and Rachel
  both get up from the bed)
Joey  Oh my God, it's Ross. What are we gonna do?
Rachel  Oh, ju-ju-just stay calm. Just be calm. For all he
  knows we're just hanging out together. Right? Just be nonchalant. (Joey like
  stands at attention with his chest forward and his hands on his sides, looking
  up at the ceiling with his lips pouted.) That's not nonchalant!
Joey  No idea what it means.
Rachel  Oh... okay, just hide!
Ross  (knocks) Rach?
Rachel  Coming! Try under the bed, try under the bed!
Rachel  There's no room under the bed. (looks around because
  she can't find Joey anymore)
Ross  Is everything okay?
Rachel  Yeah... (still looking to see where Joey went, and
  opens the door)
Ross  Hey.
Rachel  Hi...
Ross  You know where Joey is?
Rachel  ...I really don't... (looks around again)
Ross  Can I talk to you for a minute?
Rachel  Yeah, sure... (looks outside into the corridor if
  Joey is there)
Joey  I don't believe this... Have you guys been...
Phoebe  Shhh... This is the listening side of the
  wall.
Ross  And then she told me that she and Joey had broken up,
  and that part of the reason was that she had feelings for me.
Rachel  (clearly not listening and still trying to find out
  where Joey went) Uh-huh... right... yeah...
Ross  And you know I wanted to ask Charlie out since the
  day I met her.
Rachel  (still searching) Oh, I know... I know it's been
  really hard for you.
Ross  Anyway, one thing lead to another, and... oh... before
  you know it, we were kissing. I mean, how angry do you think Joey is gonna
  be?
Rachel  (now looking up at the ceiling) That is hard to say,
  Ross. That is hard to say.
Ross  You know, I gotta go find him. He's gotta be here someplace.
Rachel  You would think!
Rachel  Joey!
Joey  Is he gone?
Rachel  (still can't find him) How are you doing this?
Joey  Pssst...
Rachel  How... wha... Hey! What are you... What is this?
  Have you guys been listening this entire time?
Monica, Chandler and Phoebe  YE-AH!
Phoebe  Now, what is this?
Rachel  Ah, what is this? Well, lets see, we kissed for ten
  minutes and now we're talking to our friends about it, so I guess this is sixth
  grade!
Phoebe  Oh no... Have you thought about it how complicated
  this could get? What about Ross?
Joey  Well, he's with Charlie now.
Monica  Yeah, but he wants to talk to you before anything
  really happens with her. And as his friend, I mean, don't you think
  he deserves the same from you?
Joey  (long pause and he twitches a bit) You're a pain in
  my ass, Geller!
Rachel  All right, look you guys... Look, we appreciate all
  the advice, but this is between Joey and me and I think we can handle it...
Chandler  Okay, well we'll go back in there, but will you
  do one thing for us? The people that  care about you?
Rachel  Sure...
Chandler  Enunciate!
Rachel  Get out!
Rachel  Are they right?
Joey  Probably, yeah... I mean, maybe we should... hold off
  until we talk to Ross.
Rachel  Yeah... Yeah, we can wait, we don't have
  to do anything tonight.
Joey  Yeah, I think that'd be best... So, so I'm gonna...
  I'm gonna take off...
Rachel  (Joey walks to the door) Although...
Joey  (turns around very fast) I like although!
Rachel  I mean, you know... Ross and I haven't dated in like...
  six years...
Joey  Six years? Wow... It's almost as long as highschool...
Rachel  Plus, you know, he is with Charlie now.
Joey  Absolutely! He's not thinking about you.
Rachel  No...
Joey  I'm thinking about you...
Rachel  Yeah...
Joey  Let's forget about Ross...
Rachel  Forgotten.
Joey  What's wrong?
Rachel  Nothing...
Joey's voice, but she sees Ross  Seriously... What is it?
Rachel  Nothing... It's really... It's nothing... Come here,
  come here...
Joey's voice/Ross  What's wrong?
Rachel  Sorry, I just uhm... I can't seem to get Ross out
  of my head...
Joey  Well, maybe I can help. (he grabs her head passionately,
  closes his eyes and kisses... Ross in Rachel's dress! He realises it too late,
  and when he does, pushes Ross's/Rachel's head away)
Rachel/Ross  Ooh, your lips are so soft... Do
  that again... (and she/he moves in for another kiss. Joey, pushes her head
  away again...)
Joey  Yeah... we really need to talk to Ross...
Both  Yeah
[Scene  Chandler and Monica's room. Chandler is packing when Ross knocks on
  the door and enters...]
Ross  Hey!
Chandler  Hey!
Ross  You guys ready to go?
Chandler  Not quite. Monica's still at the salon, and I'm
  just finishing packing.
Ross  Dude! You're not taking your Bible?
Chandler  You're not supposed to take that. Besides, it's
  a New Testament, what are you gonna do with it?
Ross  Learn about Jesus...
Ross  Hey!
Charlie  So, did you talk to Joey?
Ross  Uh, no... no. I couldn't find him. I'm just gonna talk
  to him on the plane.
Charlie  Yeah, sounds like a good idea... Dr. Geller!
Ross  Stop it!
Charlie  PHD
Ross  You're filthy!
Phoebe  Hey, have you guys seen Monica?
Ross  Uh, actually I think she went to the salon.
Phoebe  Oh yeah, oh, she went to the salon alright...
Monica  Check it out!
Phoebe  Who's day just got better? CHANDLER!
Chandler  Hey!... aaaaaahhhh!
Monica  What do you think?
Chandler  I think.... I think I can see your scalp.
Monica  Don't you just love it?
Ross  Ye... Yeah... Yeah... You got shellfish in your head.
Charlie  It's so... something... You go girlfriend!
Ross  You've never said that in your life, have you?
Charlie  Not once.
Ross  I thought so.
Monica  And listen to this... (shakes her body so the shells
  tingle)
Chandler  What d'ya know... It's a treat for the eyes and the
  ears.
[Scene  Boarding the plane.]
Joey  Whoo, whoo. Wow, it's uhm... kinda weird that I'm sitting
  next to Charlie after we broke up.
Chandler  Yeah, it's almost if Air Barbados doesn't care
  about your social life.
Joey  Look, does someone mind switching to sit with Charlie?
Ross  Oh, I uh, I mean, I... dude, I spent the whole conference
  with Charlie.
Joey  I understand...
Ross  No, I'll do it. (he quickly grabs Joey's boarding pass
  and gives Joey his one.)
Chandler  Wish I could switch with someone. I really don't
  wanna sit with Allen Iverson over there.
Phoebe  Uhm... You know, once we're in the air and the captain
  turns off the seatbelt sign... you feel free to roam about my cabin...
Mike  You should be careful when checking your overhead bins,
  'cause items may shift during...
Phoebe  Aaah... you're not good at this...
Mike  You don't have to go home tonight, do you?
Phoebe  No, I think I can come over. It's Saturday, right?
Mike  Oh...
Phoebe  What?
Mike  Uhm... I can't do anything tonight.
Phoebe  Why not?
Mike  I have a date.
Phoebe  You have a... You have a date? With who?
Mike  Oh, it's... my girlfriend.
Phoebe  (lets go of his hand) You have...  have a girlfriend?
Mike  Yeah... Well, when... you and I broke up I started
  seeing someone.
Phoebe  For how long?
Mike  Three months.
Phoebe  Three months? Okay... This is probably none of my
  business, but uhm, how long do you think you're gonna keep seeing her?
Mike  I'll tell her that it's over tonight at dinner. I
  promise.
Phoebe  Oh, okay... good. You do that. And then when you
  get home, maybe there'll be a special delivery package waiting for you.
Mike  Maybe I'll sign for it. Tear it open. Pull out the
  packing material...
Phoebe  You know what, we're gonna have sex. Let's just leave
  it there.
Ross  Right, I'm gonna go talk to Joey. I think this is the
  right time. He's always in a good mood after the flight attendant says "duty
  free".
Charlie  Okay... Good luck.
Rachel  Ross is coming over. I think now would be a really
  good time to talk to him.
Joey  I guess so. I'm just... really nervous.
Rachel  Okay, well keep in mind that by the time you're done,
  they'll probably be serving dinner.
Joey  Ooh...
Rachel  Still nervous?
Joey  I'm gonna get the lasagna.
Ross  Hey Rach...
Rachel  Yeah!
Ross  Do you mind if I sit here for a sec.?
Rachel  Yeah, yeah sure! Yeah! (mouths "Good luck" to
  Joey and gets up from her seat)
Ross  Hey!
Joey  Hey!
Ross  So, I uhm... kinda need to talk to you about Charlie.
Joey  Yeah?
Ross  Okay, last night after you guys broke up... so sorry
  to hear about that, by the way... Well, Charlie and I were talking, and...,
  well...
Joey  You kissed.
Ross  Wha... (gasps) What? What would give you that idea?
Joey  I saw you.
Ross  Yeah, we kissed, but... nothing else... nothing else
  happened, okay.
Joey  Ross, Ross, Ross... It's okay.
Ross  What?
Joey  It's okay. You know, I totally understand,
  alright? You guys, make way more sense than her and I ever did, you know. And...
  I want you to be happy.
Ross  Are you serious?
Joey  Yeah... Now I have something...
Ross  I am speachless... I mean the fact that you would put
  my happiness first like that. I mean, you're an incredible friend, you know
  that?
Joey  Oh... uh...  look... before you...
Ross  No, I mean it. You are so loyal man, and selfless,
  and generous...
Joey  I am those things, yeah.
Ross  You know what? I know Chandler longer, so I always
  think of him as my best friend, but now... I may have to rethink some
  stuff...
Joey  Dude!
Ross  Hey, if there is ever, anything I can do for you...
Joey  I can't think of anything.
Ross  Thanks!
Joey  Yeah.
Rachel  So hi!
Ross  Hi!
Rachel  So you eh, you talked to Joey?
Ross  Ah, yeah. We had a really good talk.
Rachel  Oh! That's great!
Ross  Yeah!
Rachel  Oh, so everything's okay?
Ross  Oh, no, it's great. It's great. He is... He is an amazing
  guy.
Rachel  Ah... Well, obviously I think so too.
Ross  Well, I'm so excited about this.
Rachel  Really? Excited?
Ross  Are you kidding? I have had some very dirty dreams
  about this...
Rachel  Excuse me! (and she walks back to Joey, who is still
  looking very impressed about what Ross said to him. Rachel looks at him and
  hits him.) You didn't tell him, did you?
Joey  I couldn't. He was saying all these really nice things
  about me. I didn't want him to get mad and take 'em all back. I'm on a edge
  on Chandler.
Rachel  Oh God! Alright, fine. You know what Joey, forget
  it. When we go back to New York, I will tell him.
Joey  Thank you. Yeah, I appreciate that.
[Scene  Mike's apartment. Phoebe's there and the phone rings.]
Phoebe  Hi, Mike's place.
Mike  Hey, it's Mike.
Phoebe  Ooh, that was fast.
Mike  Oh, err... no, she's not here yet. You know, I think
  I'm just gonna take off and break up with her over the phone...
Phoebe  Yeah, you can't do that! Oh, come on Mike, strap
  on a pair.Why don't you just tell her that we got back together. You know,
  women appreciate honesty. We also appreciate gentle spanking once in a while.
  Just F.Y.I.
Mike  One more thing... There... might be a picture of Precious
  on my coffee table.
Phoebe  Her name is Precious? Is she a purebreed or did you
  pick her up at the pound?
Mike  Anyway, I just wanna give you a heads up.
Phoebe  Okay, oh and you know, if she gets upset, just scratch
  her tummy and give her a liver snout. (laughs and hangs up the phone)
Precious  Hi, I'm Precious, who are you?
Phoebe  (stunned) I... I'm Phoebe.
Precious  Phoebe? Mike's ex-girlfriend Phoebe, the love of
  his life? That Phoebe?
Phoebe  Enchanté (she holds out her hand, and they shake
  hands)
[Scene  Chandler and Monica's apartment. Monica's carrying the laundry hamper
  to their coffee table.]
Monica  Oh, I can't wait for everyone at work to see these...
  (plays with her hair to make the shells tingle again) Ow!
Chandler  You go back to work tomorrow night, right?
Monica  Yeah!
Chandler  So if you want people to see them, then by definition
  you're not  having them taken out... say, at the break of dawn?
Monica  Well, if I had them taken out, then I wouldn't be
  able to do this. (she pushes Chandler on the couch and brushes her
  hair and shells against Chandler's chest) You like that, right? (again, she
  brushes her hair against his chest and hums...)
Chandler  What are you singing?
Monica  It's "Bolero" from "10".
Monica  You what? You said you liked them.
Chandler  Did I? Let's refresh. I believe what I said was
  that I could see your scalp.
Monica  Fine, so you don't like them. Everybody else does.
Chandler  Again, let's journey back... As I recall what Rachel
  said, was  she had never notice the shape of your skull before. And Joey...
  Well, Joey didn't realise that there was anything different.
Monica  You know what? I don't care. I like it like this,
  and I'm gonna keep it. You're just jealous because your hair can't do this...
  (and she shakes her head more violently) OUCH!
Chandler  Hit yourself in the tooth?
Monica  And the eye!
[Scene  Ross's apartment.Someone's knocking on the door. Ross rushes to the
  door and it's Rachel with Emma.]
Ross  (gasps) Hi... There she is. Hi Emma. Oh my God, I missed
  you. (kisses her) Oh Emma, I missed you so much. Hey... Did you have
  a good time with grandma Green? Huh? Did she give you a bottle of anti-depressants
  again to use as a rattle? (to Rachel)
Rachel  That was one time, Ross, and they were only like
  5 milligrams.
Ross  Ooh hey, Emma, daddy has some presents for you okay?
  Okay? I want you to wait right here. Come here sweetie.
Rachel  Aaah... Ross, actually there's something that I really
  need to talk to you about.
Ross  (unpacking his bag) Okay, shoot!
Rachel  Okay, uhm... alright, here's the deal.
Ross  (gasps) OH NO!
Rachel  What? What is it?
Ross  Oh, major shampoo explosion!
Rachel  Uh, look Ross, this really isn't easy.
Ross  Oh, it's all over everything. Why?
  Why me? (looks up)
Rachel  Because you took three hundred bottles of shampoo?
Ross  I'm sorry, I'm sorry. You were saying?
Rachel  Well, yeah... Okay, look it's about me and...
Ross  Oh, not another one! Oh my G... And this is moisturiser.
  It's even harder to clean! Why? Why do bad things happen to good people?
Rachel  Wow! Well, clearly this is not a good time.
Ross  Duh, you think? (enters the kitchen)
[Scene  Mike's place. Phoebe is on the phone.]
Phoebe  Okay, bye. Alright, so Mike's on his way over. See,
  you thought you guys were meeting here, and he thought you were meeting at
  the restaurant, so you know... Doesn't really matter who's right or wrong.
  Point is... I'm gonna take off.
Precious  I'm not letting you leave until you tell me what's
  going on here. I mean, are you guys getting back together or something?
Phoebe  Alright... Susie, can I call you Susie?
Precious  My name is Precious.
Phoebe  Yeah, I can't say that. uhm... Susie, I'm gonna be
  straight with you... Mike and I are back together... and uhm... unfortunately
  that effectively ends your relationship with him. And he's very sorry about
  that and wishes you the best of luck in all your endeavours.
Precious  I just can't believe this... Why?
Phoebe  Well, I don't...
Precious  Oh, why would he do this? I mean, what's wrong
  with me?
Phoebe  Nothing, there's nothing wrong with you.
Precious  I mean, what the hell am I supposed to do now?
Phoebe  Damn it woman, pull yourself together! Have
    some pride, for the love of God.
Phoebe  Okay, not a fan of the tough love.
Precious  I just can't believe that Mike didn't give me any
  warning.
Phoebe  But he didn't really know, you know. He wasn't planning
  on coming to Barbados and proposing to me...
Precious  He proposed to you? This is the worst birthday  ever.
  (she starts to cry again)
Phoebe  Look, Precious... Mike's not worth this.
  You're an attractive, intelligent woman and let's face it, Mike's kind of a
  wang. I mean, he proposed to me while he was still seeing you... He was gonna
  break-up with you on your birthday? And, I don't like to kiss-and-tell,
  but he cheated on you a lot this weekend.
Precious  Oh, my God, maybe you're right. Maybe I don't need
  him. I deserve to be treated with respect.
Precious  Screw you, Mike. You're a coward and a bastard,
  and I hope you rot in hell.
Phoebe  You're welcome!
[Scene  Chandler and Monica's. Only Chandler is in the living room and walks
  to the bathroom.]
Chandler  Honey, you've been in there for a long time...
  Is everything okay?
Monica  Not really.
Monica  I have a problem.
Chandler  Really? What happened?
Monica  Well, I was dancing around, and singing "No Woman,
  No Cry" and I got stuck.
Chandler  You can't move at all?
Monica  Oh, well, I can move... (she moves back and forth
  the shower curtain rail, opening and closing the shower curtain with her hair
  as she goes)
Chandler  If I untangle you, will you please get rid of the
corn rose?
Monica  (looking disappointed) I guess so...
Chandler  (trying to untangle her) Some of these look a little
  frayed.
Monica  Yeah, I tried to gnaw myself free.
[Scene  Rachel and Joey's apartment. Joey enters.]
Joey  Hey!
Rachel  Hi!
Joey  So, did you err... did you tell Ross?
Rachel  Well, I tried, but then he had a shampoo related
  emergency. So I guess now it's your turn again.
Joey  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no... I think it's better
  if you tell him, you know. It's easier for a woman. That way, you know, if
  he gets mad, all you have to do is go... I didn't mean it. I'm so so--ooory. (he
  pushes  his breasts together from the side)
Rachel  Yeah, 'cause that's what we do.
Joey  Alright, alright, okay, uhm... How 'bout this, how
  about this? Tomorrow... tomorrow we'll both go and we'll tell him together.
Rachel  Okay, that sounds fair. It just means that once again
  we can't...
Joey  I know, I know..., but that's okay. I mean, we can
  control ourselves, we're not animals.
Rachel  No! Of course we can wait. Alright, so I guess that
  means good night then?
Joey  Yeah! Good night! (they give each other a small kiss
  on the mouth, and stare at each other for a while)
Rachel  Goo--ood night!
Joey  Good night! (they give each other a kiss again, but
  this time it lasts longer)
Rachel  Seriously, good night!
Joey  Stop saying good night.
Rachel  Okay.
[Scene  Monica and Chandler's. Monica walks in with one of those knitted Rasta
  hats.]
Monica  Look what I found in the drawer... (Chandler looks
  up from his book.) And you said I'd never wear this...
Chandler  Now that I untangled you, how 'bout you doing a
  little something for me?
Monica  Sure, what do you have in mind?
Chandler  I think you know.
Monica  Really? I don't really feel like it.
Chandler  This is what I want to do.
Monica  Okay, I just don't get why you like it so much.
Chandler  (Picks up the "Miss Congeniality" DVD) She's an
  FBI agent, posing as a beauty contestant.

[Scene  Joey and Rachel's apartment. The scene starts where we took off in
the last episode with Ross seeing Joey and Rachel kissing. Rosss tares at them.]
Joey  Okay, Ross, I realise that you didn't expect to walk in and see  that, but.. Let me explain, okay?
Rachel  We weren't doing anything!
Joey  Rach, he just saw us.
Rachel  Shhh.
Joey  But what you saw, that is the extent of it, okay? One kiss.
Rachel  No, come on, that is a lie. We also kissed in Barbados.
Joey (to Rachel)  Dude, chill! (to Ross) Okay, we also kissed in  Barbados,
but we didn't plan it, okay? And the only reason that that happened was because
I saw you kissing Charlie.
Rachel  Yeah, you started it! I've got to chill.
Joey  Look, we probably should have talked to you about this before it  ever happened, but..
Rachel  We feel so terrible about this, Ross.
Joey  Yeah, but it did happen, so...
Joey  Ross?
Rachel  Ross? (to Joey) Can we just close the door?
[Scene  Joey and Rachel's apartment. Continued from earlier.]
Rachel  Ross, say something. Anything.
Ross  So you two are..?
Joey and Rachel  Yeah.
Ross  And have you .. ed?
Joey  No, no, no!
Rachel  No, no, no!
Ross  But if I hadn't walked in here, would you..?
Joey  Probably.
Joey  No, no!
Rachel  Ross, this is not how we wanted you to find out about this.  You have every right to go nuts.
Ross  I'm not going nuts. Do you see me go nuts?
Rachel  No, but you know what I mean.
Ross  Hey, hey, hey... If you two are happy, then I'm happy for you.  (Squeaky.) I'm fine!
Joey  Really?
Ross  Absolutely. (Very Squeaky.) I'm fine! Totally fine. I don't know  why
  it's coming out all loud and squeaky, 'cause really, (deep voice)  I'm fine.
  I'm not saying I wasn't a little surprised to see you guys  kissing. I mean,
at first I was like.. (Screams.) But now that I've had time to absorb it; Lovin'
this.
Joey  Ross..
Ross  It's all working out! Me & Charlie, and you two. You know what
  we should do?
Rachel  Calm ourselves?
Ross  No. We should all have dinner. Yes, we'll do it tomorrow night.
  I'll cook!!
Joey  Look, don't you think that will be a little weird?
Ross  Weird? What? What's weird? The only thing weird would be if
  someone didn't like Mexican food, because I'm making fajitas!! (Storms
  off.)
Joey  I do like fajitas.
[Scene  Central Perk. Monica and Chandler are there. They have lots of
  brochures about adoption in front of them.]
Monica  God, this adoption stuff is so overwhelming. There's
  inter-country adoption, dependency adoption.. There are so many ways
  to go, and this is like the biggest decision of our lives.
Chandler  There's a hair in my coffee.
Phoebe  Hey guys!
Monica  Hey.
Phoebe  Hey, have you seen Frank Jr., 'cause he's meeting me here with
  the triplets.
Chandler  You know, it's funny. Every time you say "triplets," I
  immediately think of three hot blonde 19-year olds.
Monica  That's sweet. Drink your hair.
Phoebe  Hey, what's all this stuff?
Monica  Oh, they're brochures from different adoption agencies.
Phoebe  Ooh, babies! Oh, this one is so cute, get this one!
Monica  That's not really how it works.
Phoebe  Oh, how does it work?
Monica  I don't know!
Phoebe  Well, if you're having a hard time, you should talk to my
  friends, Bill and Colleen. They adopted a kid. I'm sure they'd help
  you.
Monica  Thanks, that would be great. Hey, honey, wouldn't that be
  great?
Frank Jr.  Alright, alright, alright. Remember what we talked about.
  When we're in a public place, there are certain rules.
Frank Jr.  That's not what we talked about!!
Phoebe  Hey!
Frank Jr.  Hey.
Phoebe  Good to see you.
Frank Jr.  Good to see you, too.
Monica  Hi Frank.
Frank Jr.  Hi, how you doin'?
Monica  Oh, my goodness, they've all gotten so big!
Monica  Which one is which again?
Frank Jr.  Oh, that's Frank Jr. Jr. pulling the tampons out of the
  lady's purse. And that's Chandler climbing on Chandler, and that's
  Leslie throwing bagels at him.
Monica (reads a form in her lap)  "Willing to adopt triplets?" No!
[Scene  The hallway in Ross's building. Joey and Rachel are on their
  way to Ross's dinner.]
Joey  Ah, can I just say I know we're doing this for Ross, and that's
  cool, but if it was up to me, this is not what we'd be doing on our
  first date.
Rachel  Well, what would we be doing?
Joey  I'd take you out for a romantic night. Some champagne, fancy
  dinner, feel you up on the carriage ride home...
Rachel  Feel me up?
Joey  In a carriage!
Joey  Hey, Charlie!
Rachel  Hey.
Charlie  Hi, hi. So.. Dreading this?
Rachel  Oh, you bet.
Joey  So, did you bring a little something for Ross?
Charlie  Actually.. It's stuff you left at my apartment.
Joey  Oh. Oh, thanks.
Charlie  And you know, you can just give me my stuff whenever you
  want.
Joey  Yeah, I didn't throw any of that out..
Ross  I thought I heard voices! Hi Charlie! (Kisses her.) Hi Joey.
  (Hugs him.) And.. Oh! You're gonna have to introduce me to your new
  girlfriend. (Laughs.) I'm just kidding, I know Rachel, I know. (He
  squeezes her hand.) Come, please come in. Come in.
Rachel  Okay, well, we brought you some wine.
Ross  Oh! That is so thoughtful. (To Joey.) She's a keeper. And what
  did you bring me? (Grabs the bag that Charlie brought for Joey.)
Joey  Uh, actually, that's..
Ross  Underwear, a toothbrush, and Van Halen CD. I can use all these
  things!!
Charlie  Gosh, Ross, you know, you seem a little...
Ross  What? Fine? Because I am! Aren't you? Aren't you? Aren't you?
  You see? Who else is fine?
Joey  Okay, listen, hey, Ross. Why don't you try to relax, okay? Maybe
  have a drink.
Ross  You know what? That is a very good idea. I'm gonna go make a
  pitcher of Margaritas.
[Scene  Central Perk. Frank Jr., Phoebe and the triplets are there.
  The triplets are now sleeping on top of each other on the couch.]
Phoebe  Oh, god. So adorable. Look at them sleeping there like angels.
Frank Jr.  Yeah, I really cherish these moments, 'cause before you
  know it, they're gonna be awake again.
Phoebe  Well, they may be a handful, but they're so cute.
Frank Jr.  Yeah.
Phoebe  Oh, god, the last time I babysat them, they did the funniest
  thing..
Frank Jr.  I haven't slept in four years!
Phoebe  That's a, that's a long time.
Frank Jr.  You just don't know how hard it is, Phoebe. There's just so
  many of them. You know, two I can handle. Two's great. You just hold
  one in each hand, but what do I do when the third one runs at me with
  his bike helmet on. I've got no more hands to protect my area! There's
  three of them, Phoebe, three!
Phoebe  Yeah, I know, Frank. I counted them when they were coming out
  of my area.
Frank Jr.  Sometimes I think that.. Oh, no, no, no, I can't say it,
  it's too horrible. No.
Phoebe  What?
Frank Jr.  No, I can't.
Phoebe  Oh my god, Frank, are you thinking of leaving? Because I
  didn't have those triplets so you could just run out on them!
Frank Jr.  Oh, no! I would never do that. No. I just was thinking
  that, you know, maybe you could take one.
Phoebe  What?! You can't separate them! That's terrible. Which one?
[Scene  Bill and Colleen's apartment. Chandler and Monica enter.]
Monica  Thank you so much for seeing us. Phoebe has told us such great
  things about you guys.
Colleen  Oh, please, we're happy to help.
Bill  We went through the same thing when we were adopting.
Chandler  So, a lot of malfunctioning wee-wees and hoo-hoos in this
  room, huh?
Chandler  I mean, you have a lovely home.
Monica  Well, we appreciate anything you can tell us.
Colleen  Well, actually, I think this might help.
Colleen  It's pretty much all the information you need.
Monica  Oh my god!
Colleen  Everything is broken down into categories, and then
  cross-referenced, and then colour-coded to correspond with the forms
  in the back.
Monica  Thank you. (To Chandler.) I think I just had a tiny orgasm.
Bill  I know the process is frustrating, but it's so worth it.
  Adopting Owen was the best thing that ever happened to us.
Chandler  That's great. (To Monica.) Can I see the book?
Chandler  You want me to wash my hands first, don't you?
Monica  It's.. It's just so pretty and white.
Colleen  The bathroom is down the hall, to your left.
Colleen  I would have told him to do it too.
Monica  Can I adopt you?
Chandler  Hey, you must be Owen.
Owen  Yeah.
Chandler  I'm Chandler. Hey, I was in the scouts too.
Owen  You were?
Chandler  Yeah, in fact my father was a den-mother.
Owen  Huh?
Chandler  You know how to use a compass?
Owen  I have a badge in it.
Chandler  You do? That's fantastic!
Owen  You wanna see it?
Chandler  I'd love to, but I gotta get back to talking to your
  parents. They're telling us all about how they adopted you.
Owen  What?!?
Chandler  What?
Owen  I'm adopted?
Chandler  I got nothing.
[Scene  Ross's apartment. Ross is totally wasted, but he's still
  drinking all the margaritas.]
Ross  The first batch of margaritas was not so great, but the second
  batch is gooooood.
Rachel  Well, maybe the next batch, we could all get some.
Ross  Oh, guys, this is fun, isn't it? You know? Just the four of us.
  Just hangin'.
Joey  Dude, are you okay? And when are the fajitas gonna be ready?
Ross  I'm fine! Hey, I'm great! I'm just.. I'm just proud of us.
  There's no weirdness, no tension.
Rachel  No awareness.
Ross  We make a great foursome. We should do more stuff together. Ooh!
  Let's take a trip. Okay, where do you think we - we can go?
Ross  My fajitas!!
Rachel  Look, Charlie, I just want you to know. Ross is just having a
  little trouble adjusting to the thought of Joey and me. You know, he
  normally doesn't drink like this.
Charlie  Oh, you know what? This is nothing. My father is a raging
  alcoholic.
Charlie  Oh, I'm sorry, have I made this evening uncomfortable?
Ross  Fajitas! Be careful, very hot plate, very hot plate!!
Rachel  Ross, you don't even have oven mitts on!
Ross  That is gonna hurt tomorrow!
[Scene  Central Perk. Frank Jr., Phoebe and the triplets are there.
  Continued from earlier.]
Phoebe  Okay, well, this is crazy. Can't seriously be talking about me
  taking one of your kids, can we?
Frank Jr.  No, of course we're not.
Phoebe  Insane.
Frank Jr.  I know.
Phoebe  Alice would never go for it, right?
Frank Jr.  Oh, I don't know, she's pretty tired, too, I think we've
  got her onboard.
Phoebe  Well, just you know, for argument's sake, you know,
  hypothetically. Which one would you be willing to give up?
Frank Jr.  Huh.
Phoebe  Frank Jr.Jr.?
Frank Jr.  Oh, you'd be getting a really good one. I mean, you know,
  he's really funny. Like, the other day he made up this joke.
Phoebe  Uh-huh.
Frank Jr.  What's green and says "hey, I'm a frog"? A talking frog!
  (Laughs.) Oh, no, you can't have him, he's too funny.
Phoebe  Well, alright, that's fine. What about Leslie?
Frank Jr.  Oh, no, no. Not Leslie. No, she's, she's the only one that
  knows how to burp the alphabet.
Phoebe  Alright, so that leaves Chandler.
Frank Jr.  Oh, no, no, you can't have Chandler, no. No, no. She's my
  little genius. I got big hopes for her. She's gonna be a doctor or a
  realtor..
Phoebe  Wow, Frank. I think we just ran out of kids.
Frank Jr.  Oh, I think you're right. Oh, wow. Phoebe, I don't think I
  can give one of them up. I mean, you know, they drive me crazy, but
  they're my babies.
Phoebe  I'm sorry, Frank. I didn't realise things were so bad. You
  know, I'll help out more. I can - I can babysit any time you want. You
  name the day, and I'll be there.
Frank Jr.  How about tomorrow?
Phoebe  Well, that's not good. But you know, I can move some stuff
  around, and I'll be there. You and Alice just take the whole day
  together.
Frank Jr.  You'd do that for us?
Phoebe  Are you kidding? That's what sisters are for.
Frank Jr. (looks at the triplets)  Look at them! Aw. I love you so
  much. (Strokes Leslie's hair, and she moves a little.) Oh crap, don't
  wake up, don't wake up!
[Scene  Bill and Colleen's apartment. Chandler comes running into the
  living room. Monica is the only one there.]
Chandler  Where are Bill and Colleen?
Monica  They're in the kitchen getting something to eat. Can you
  believe how nice they are?
Chandler  We have to leave!!
Monica  Why? What did you do in the bathroom?
Chandler  I didn't get to the bathroom. I bumped into Owen on the way,
  and he didn't know he was adopted. And there's a slight chance I may
  have told him.
Monica  Oh my god, where's my purse? No, you know what? I can replace
  everything in there. Get that binder, and let's go!
Colleen  Hey.
Bill  Some little snacks for everybody. Oh, you don't have to eat the
  sour worms. Those are for Owen.
Colleen  I'll go get him in a second. By the way, you should know we
  haven't told him he's adopted yet.
Chandler  But kids are so intuitive. Don't you think on some level he
  already knows?
Owen  I'm adopted?!
Chandler  See? Intuitive!
Bill  What? Where did you hear that?
Owen  He told me! And he paid me 50 dollars not to tell.
Chandler  Which technically now you should give back!
Colleen  You told him he's adopted?
Chandler  I'm so sorry, but you should have a sign out there or
  something. Or at least whisper it to people when they come in the
  door. "Owen doesn't know he's adopted, and he also thinks that Santa
  is real."
Owen  He isn't?!
Chandler (to Monica)  We have to get out of here, baby!
[Scene  Ross's apartment. Rachel, Joey and Charlie are eating fajitas
  when Ross enters from the kitchen.]
Ross  Everyone? I would like to make a toast to Rachel and Joey.
Rachel  Ooy.
Ross  And to love. Ah, love. L-O-V-E, love. L is for life. And what is
  life without love?
Rachel  Oh my god, are we supposed to answer?
Ross  O is for "oh, wow!" The V is for this very surprising turn
  of
  events, which I'm still fine with by the way. E is for how extremely
  normal I find it. That you two are together. And now one day you might
  get married and have children of your own.
Joey  Dude, are you okay?
Ross  Totally.
Rachel  Ross, you don't seem okay.
Ross (on the verge of tears)  I'm sorry, it must be the pressure of
  entertaining. I think everyone would feel better if we had some flan.
Charlie  Wait, Ross. Ross. I - I have to take off.
Ross  No!
Charlie  I'm sorry, I have a really early class in the morning, but
  this has been lovely.
Ross  Wasn't it? And you thought it would be awkward with Joey and
  that you never really liked Rachel.
Charlie  You're on fire! I'll call you in the morning, okay?
Ross  Okay.
Charlie  Alright.
Charlie  God, Rachel, what Ross just said that is just so..
Rachel  Oh, that's okay, girls tend not to like me.
Charlie  Bye.
Ross  Okay, I guess it's just flan for three! Hey, hey, that rhymed!
Rachel  You know what, Ross? I think we're gonna take off too.
Ross  Oh, oh. Of course. God, I'm so stupid. You guys are a couple
  now. I mean, you probably just want to be alone.
Rachel  No, no, it's just that it's getting late...
Ross  Hey, hey, it's fine. It's totally fine. We've got plenty of
  margaritas. It's all good.
Ross  I don't even know what that's for.
Joey  You know what? I think I'm gonna stay here and make sure he's
  okay.
Rachel  Yeah, that's probably a good idea.
Joey  Yeah. I'll see you in the morning.
Rachel  Uh-huh. Okay. You know what, Joey, I don't think he's ever
  gonna be okay with this.
Joey  It doesn't look good, does it?
[Scene  Ross's apartment the next morning. Ross is very hung-over on
  the couch as Joey enters with a cup of coffee for him.]
Joey  Morning. Here you go.
Ross  Thanks. Did you stay here all night?
Joey  Yeah.
Ross  So you took off my pants and shoes?
Joey  No, no, no. You actually did that when you were dancing to the
  Chicago-soundtrack. Look, Ross, about, about Rachel and I. Listen, you
  don't have to worry about that, okay? Because nothing is gonna happen.
Ross  What do you mean?
Joey  Well, she and I said from the beginning that we weren't gonna do
  anything unless you were okay with it. And clearly..
Ross  Hey, what are you talking about? I'm fine!
Joey  It's okay, Ross, alright? I totally understand. Of course you're
  not fine. You're.. You're Ross and Rachel.
Ross  Except we're not. I mean, we haven't been a couple in like, six
  years. Oh my god, is that right? Has it been that long?
Joey  That's what I hear, yeah.
Ross  This is crazy. I mean, six years? And because of me you guys
  aren't gonna be together? Can I ask you something? Really, what is
  this thing with you and Rachel?
Joey  Come on, I mean, you know me, you know...
Ross  Joey.
Joey  I'm crazy about her.
Ross  And she feels the same way?
Joey  I think so.
Ross  Well, then, maybe it's time we all moved on.
Joey  Yeah, but, Ross, I mean, you're not okay with it.
Ross  No, but I wanna be. Hey, I will be. Besides, I'm with Charlie,
  right? Oh my god, I'm still with Charlie, aren't I? I mean, she didn't
  see the dance, did she?
Joey  No, no, no, no, that was - that was just for me. Are you sure
  about this?
Ross  Yeah, I'm sure.
Joey  And we're okay?
[Scene  Central Perk. Monica and Chandler enter to find Phoebe there
  with the triplets.]
Monica  Hey, Phoebs
Phoebe  Hey.
Monica  Uhm, we just wanna give you a heads-up. Bill and Colleen hate
  us.
Chandler  Owen didn't know he was adopted, and Monica told him.
Monica  What?
Phoebe  Still, he had to find out sometime.
Chandler  Yeah, but how would you like it if someone told the triplets
  that you gave birth to them?
Chandler  I'm gonna go tell Emma she was an accident. (Runs off.)
[Scene  Joey and Rachel's apartment]
Chandler  So, you and Rachel tonight, huh?
Joey  Yeah. It's actually our first official date
Chandler  Wow! So tonight may be the night! You're nervous?
Joey  Naa, no. This is the part I'm actually good at.
Chandler  What must it be like not to be crippled by fear
  and self-loathing.
Joey  (pause) It's OK!
Chandler  How can you be so confident?
Joey  Well, I... I know exactly what I'm gonna do!
Chandler  Really? Like you have a routine?
Joey  No, no no no no. See. Each woman is different.You have
  to appreciate their uniqueness.
Chandler  Really?
Joey  No, I do six things! First, I look deep in her eyes.
  Then, I kiss her. Next I take my hand and I softly graze her thigh.
Chandler  You mean like this? (he starts touching his thigh
  in a funny and awkard way)
Joey  NO! Not like that, no no. No, like this. (He starts
  lightly grazing Chandler's thigh)
Chandler  Oh, I see what you mean, that's quite nice. (They
  look at each other, both embarassed)
Joey  More foosball?
Chandler  ...and beer!!
[Scene Central Perk. Ross and Chandler are on the couch]
Monica  (entering) Hey!
Ross and Chandler  Hey!
Monica  (to Chandler) Hey sweetie! (they
  kiss)
Ross  (looking at Monica's legs) WOW!
Chandler  Hey! Stop staring at my wife's legs! No no! Stop
  staring at your sister's legs!
Ross  I'm sorry, it's just... how did you get so tan?
Chandler  She went on one of those spray-on tan places.
Ross  Eh, you got a spray-on tan?
Monica  Chandler gets pedicures!
Ross  (laughing) Why, why you do, like with the-the toe separators?
Chandler  (To Monica) Why...why?
Ross  Still, I can't believe that's sprayed on... I mean,
  it looks really good. I wonder if I should get one!
Chandler  Sure, then you should get a mini skirt so you can
  really show it off.
Ross  So, do you get colours or just French tips?
Monica  There. Here's their card.
Ross  Thanks. (he takes the card) Hey, I know where this
  place is! It used to be an X-rated video... (pauses when he realizes what he
  is saying) florist. (he goes away)
Phoebe  Hey!
Chandler  Hey Pheebs!
Monica  Hey Phoebe!
Phoebe  Oh, you won't believe who moved back to town.
Monica  I know, Amanda! Ah! She called me
  too! She's the worst!
Chandler  Who's Amanda?
Monica  She's this girl who used to live
  in the building before you did. Then she moved to England and she picked up
  this fake British accent. On the machine this is her message. (she apes Amanda
  using an awful British accent) "Monica, darling! It's Amanda calling!"
Chandler  Are you trying to do a British accent?
Monica  (pause) (to Phoebe) Chandler gets
  pedicures!
Chandler  Just so I know, how many more of those can I expect?
Phoebe  You know what Amanda said to me when she got me on
  the phone? (apes Amanda in a british accent) "Oh, so sorry to catch you
  on your Mo-Bile!" If-if you don't wanna get me on my mo-Bile, don't call
  me on my mo-Bile!"
Monica  I know, and she's always bragging
  about all the famous people she's met.
Phoebe  Oh, I know! "Oh...I slept with Billy Joel".
  All right, who hasn't?
Monica  Oh, what are we gonna do! I don't
  wanna see her!!
Phoebe  Ugh, Let's just cut her out!
Monica  What?
Phoebe  Cut her out of our lives! Just ignore her calls and
  dodge her 'till she gets the point!
Monica  Oh, I guess we could try that, but...
  it seems so harsh! (to Chandler) Have you ever done that?
Chandler  No, had it done to me though. Feels good !
[Scene  At the tanning salon. Ross and a male assistant are
  walking through a hall]
Ross  Well... I like how you look, what are you?
Assistant  Puerto Rican.
Ross  Two, I think a two.
Assistant  You've got to face the red light.
  When the red light goes on the spraying is about to start so close your eyes.
  When the spraying stops, count to five. Pat yourself down to avoid drip marks
  then turn around so we can get your back. Got it?
Ross  Spray, count, pat, then turn, spray, count and pat.
Assistant  Wow, you catch on quick.
Ross  Well, I have a PhD, so... (assistant walk out, not
  impressed by this statement)
  (Ross takes his bathrobe off and he enters the tanning booth. He stands up
  in front of the red light and the sprayer starts and sprays his face and torso)
Ross  One Mississipi, two Mississipi, Three Mis...(the sprayer
  starts again, spraying him in the face and torso again) WAIT! WAIT! I'm not-I've
  not finished counting!! (he leaves the booth) (the assistant enters the room)
Ross  You sprayed my front twice!
Assistant  You've never turned?
Ross  No, I barely even
  got to three Mississippi.
Assistant  Mississippi? I said count to
  five'!
Ross  Mississippilesly? (pause) Well, how
  bad is it?
Assistant  Ain't that bad yet, but it keeps
  getting darker for the next four hours.
Ross  So, how dark is it
  gonna get?
Assistant  You got sprayed with two two'
  s and...
Ross  I'm a four?
Assistant  Yeah, but you're back's a zero.
  You're gonna wanna even that out.
Ross  (sarcastically) Really!
Assistant  You might wanna get back in there.
Ross  (annoyed) Ok!
Ross  Wait, wait a minute, there's no light
  on the back wall! How do I know when it's gonna start? Hello? (he slowly turns
  and the spraying begins, on his face) Ah, oh, ah! (he turns, but then he turns
  again and is sprayed in the front again) Ah! (he spits and angrily goes out
  of the spray-on tan booth and the assistant enters the room) The same thing
  happened again!
Assistant  You got two more twos?
Ross  (hysterically) I'm an eight!
[Scene  Joey’s apartment. Joey and Rachel enter the room]
Joey  I thought you paid. (Rachel does not answer and seems
  puzzled) Ha, guess we won’t be going back there!
Rachel  So.
Joey  Yeah.
Joey  Hey what do you say, we move this onto the likes of
  the couch?
Rachel  I say ‘cheesy line’, but ok.
Joey  What’s the matter?
Rachel  I am sorry, I don’t know, I am sorry, I don’t
  know why I did that!
Joey and Rachel  Okay
Rachel  Ok, so sorry.
Rachel  I am sorry! Again... I don't know, I don’t
  know what happened, I must be nervous!
Joey  I don’t get it, Chandler loved it!
Rachel  Ok, ok, ok. I promise, I promise, I promise, I won’t
  do it again. I really do. I promise. This is gonna be great.
Joey  Ok.
[Scene  Monica’s apartment. Monica and Phoebe are reading
  magazines when the phone rings and Phoebe reaches to pick it up]
Phoebe  Oh, yeah. Could be Rachel asking if someone could
  baby-sit again.
Monica  It could be Amanda!
Phoebe  Oh, you’re right! I was just kidding about
  Rachel. Babysitting is a gas!
Amanda  Hello Monica. It’s Amanda calling again. I
  am in the neighborhood hoping I can pop by your flat!
Monica  You're from Yonkers! Your last name
  is Buffo-Martisis!
Amanda  Let’s see.. to assure you get this directly,
  ring me back on my mobile.
Phoebe  Ok, don’t hold thy breath!
Chandler  Hello? Is someone on the line?
Amanda  Yes, I was looking for Monica.
Chandler  Hang on, she’s right here. (he enters the
  living room and hands the phone to Monica) Someone's on the phone, for ya.
Monica  We weren’t picking up, it’s
  Amanda!
Chandler  (to Amanda) I get pedicures!
Monica  Hi Amanda! Actually now... it’s...
  is not a good time. Dinner tomorrow night? (Phoebe mouths 'no') Ok, Phoebe
  and I will see you then!
Phoebe  Why, why, why didn’t you just say no!
Monica  Well, I said 'no' to her coming
  over now! I couldn’t say 'no' twice! I get this uncontrollable need to
  please people!
Phoebe  (leaving) Fine, fine! You would not hold up well
  under torture!
Monica  And you would?
[scene  Joey’s apartment. Joey and Rachel are sitting
  on the couch]
Rachel  Absolutely! Absolutely. I d... it’s just a
  little weird, it’s you, and it’s me, it's just gonna take some
  getting used to.
Joey  Ok. Well, how, how can we make it easier?
Rachel  Ok, let’s work from the top down! (Joey nods,
  but then puzzled because he does not get it) Just work the bra, Joe!
Joey  Ok, yeah, got it.
Rachel and Joey  Okay.
Joey  This thing welded shut?!
Rachel  Okay.
Joey  All right, turn around, I got to get a look at this
  thing.
Rachel  Oh!
Rachel  Ow!
Joey  Sorry!
Rachel  Well this is romantic!
Joey  I'm sorry! (He stands up) This never happened to me
  before! I'm an expert at taking off bras! I can do it with one hand! I can
  do it with my eyes closed! One time I just looked at one, and it popped open!
  I blame your bra!
Rachel  It’s a standard issue bra clasp!
Joey  Then I blame you! Yeah! That's right! You threw me
  off with all your slapping!
Rachel  Ok well, well I'm really, I'm sorry about that Joey,
  but do you think that maybe on some level, you don't want to take
  off my bra?
[Scene  Monica and Chandler's apartment]
Chandler  Hold on! There is something different.
Ross  I went to that tanning place your wife suggested.
Chandler  Was that place... The Sun?
Ross  Oh! And it gets worse! (Turns his side to Chandler
  and Monica and pulls up his shirt. There's a distinct line across his body,
  where his belly is very tanned and his back is very pale.)
Chandler  Oh My God! You can do a duet of Ebony and Ivory
  all by yourself!
Monica  How could you mess this up? It's
  so easy? You go into the booth, you count to five and you turn around!!
Ross  (looks at her suspiciously) How do you count to five?
Monica  One Two Three...
Ross  (Yells) Damnit! (Goes to the door to leave. Rachel
  just enters, sees him and starts laughing)
Rachel  (laughing) oooh! Oh oh!
Ross  (Still yelling) I Know!
Rachel  oh oh! What is up with Miss Hawaiian Tropic?
Chandler  How was your date with Joey?
Rachel  Well, it was good.. until we got back to our apartment,
  and then we were fooling around and he started to put his hand up my leg and
  I kept slapping it away!
Chandler  You didn't like that?
Rachel  Well, it wasn't just me, alright? He freaked out
  too! He couldn't even undo my bra!
Monica  Wow, really? One time he just looked
  at my bra and it popped open.
Rachel  I do not know what's wrong with us, I mean, we have
  kissed before and that's been great! But this time it was leading somewhere
  and I was very aware of the fact that it was Joey touching me.
Monica  Well, you guys have been friends
  forever. Remember the first time that you kissed Ross? How weird that was?
  You couldn't stop laughing? You got through that.
Rachel  (looking thoughtful) Ok, that's true. That's true,
  we can do this. You're right, you're right, we can do this. We're just gonna
  power through!
Joey  Hey Chandler can I talk to you for a second (points
  to the hall).
Rachel  (To Joey) No need!! Problem solved, we are powering through
  (At which point she grabs his hand and pulls him back to their apartment).
Monica  (sees what he is doing) Chandler,
  stop! It is not going to pop open!
[Scene  Central Perk.]
Monica  Hey Phoebe!
Phoebe  Hey!
Monica  Is Amanda here yet?
Phoebe  No.
Monica  (sits down) Oh good. Good, look
  I'm so sorry, for screwing up that cutting-her-out plan. But I have a new plan.
  Chandler agreed to call here in a few minutes with an emergency.
Phoebe  Oh! Well, what kind of emergency that gets us both
  out of here?
Monica  Well, what do you think of Mike
  and Chandler being in a car accident?
Phoebe  (makes a face) Are you kidding, I love it!
Phoebe  Hi!
Monica  Hi!
Amanda  Hi! (Phoebe and Amanda hug)
Amanda  (To Monica) Hello!
Monica  (beaming) Yeah! Yeah! His name is
  Chandler and...
Amanda  (To Phoebe) Smell my neck! (Phoebe does so) It's
  not perfume! It's me! It's my natural scent!
Phoebe  Musty!
Amanda  Oh! Gosh! This is brilliant. Gosh, it's just like
  old times. I'm so happy you two are friends again!
Monica  When were we not friends?
Amanda  Well, it was 1992, and I remember because that was
  the year I had sex with Evil Knievel (She starts laughing very proudly).
Monica  Ehm, we were friends in 1992.
Amanda  (to Phoebe) No I distinctly remember you were dodging
  her (points at Monica) calls and trying to avoid seeing her.
Monica  (To Phoebe) You were going to cut
  me out?
Phoebe  Well...kinda.
Monica  Oh My God!
Amanda  Oh! Bugger. Should I not have said that? I feel like
  a perfect arse!
Phoebe  Yeah well, in America you're just an "ass".
Monica  (Into the phone) Hello? Chandler,
  what's wrong? (She listens) Oh my God, are you alright? (listens some more)
  Yeah, I'll be right there. (She hangs up and speaks to Amanda) I'm so sorry,
  but Chandler was in a car accident. (She gets up)
Phoebe  (Also gets up and starts taking her purse) Oh my
  God. Was Mike with him?
[Scene  Joey and Rachel's apartment.]
Joey  (To Rachel) Hey!
Rachel  Hey! Got champagne?
Joey  Yes ma'am, ready to Power through!
Rachel  Excellent! Stick it in the ice bucket, the phone
  is off the hook, and in the interest of powering through (Starts to remove
  her bra from under her clothes)...
Joey  Uh! (When she's done she throws her bra at him)
Rachel  Ok (starts to light some candles) Sexy, sexy, very
  sexy, sexy. (Claps her hands and jumps at Joey, clearly very excited) Alright!
  Lets do it!
Joey  Ok, you're scaring me a little bit.
Rachel  Oh! Get over it soldier, we've gotta do this! (She
  pulls him towards her and throws him onto the barcalounger) Ok. Aha! You like
  that huh?
Joey  Oh! yeah!
Rachel  You like that? (She climbs on the barcalounger seductively,
  putting her knees next to Joey's hips.) Let's take this into high gear (She
  pulls the barcalounger lever and seat reclines. She puts one of her knees between
  his legs and begins to kiss his neck.)
Joey  uh uh!
Rachel  Yeah baby, I'll show you how we do it!
Joey  No, no, no! You kneed me in my misters!
Rachel  What? Oh my God! I'm so sorry. Joey? Are you ok?
Monica  We are not friends with Phoebe anymore.
Chandler  If she asks, I protested a little, but ok!
Phoebe  Oh Chandler! Thank God you're alive. Monica, can
  I talk to you outside for a minute?
Monica  I have nothing to say to
  you.
Amanda  (announces more to herself than anyone else) Wow,
  my flat is twice this size!
Phoebe  Please, Monica? In the hall?
Amanda  Ooh, that accident must have been terrible. You look
  positively ghastly.
Chandler  Well, aren't you a treat.
[Scene  The hallway]
Monica  I can't believe you tried to cut
  me out. Why Phoebe, why?
Phoebe  It was right after we were living together and you
  were driving me crazy, okay? You were really controlling and compulsive and
  shrill.
Monica  I'm still all those things!
Phoebe  You're also so generous and kind and scrappy!
Monica  (starts smiling) I am scrappy.
Phoebe  Exactly! Look, no matter what I tried to do, I couldn't
  keep you out of my life. Of all the people I have cut out, you were the only
  one who ever clawed her way back in.
Monica  It's because I'm scrappy.
Phoebe  Yeah, you are. And I'm so glad that you fought your
  way back in, because I don't know what I would do without you.
Monica  I won't know what I would do without
  you.
Monica  Well, I guess we should go back
  in. When you gave me another chance, I guess we should do the same for Amanda.
Phoebe  Yeah, I guess you're right.
Amanda  Can you believe it. I've never had any professional
  dance training.
[Scene  A different spray-on tan center]
Glenda  Now, let me explain how this works. You go into the
  booth, and...
Ross  I'm gonna stop you right there, Glenda. Okay? Does
  it look like this is my first time, huh? Now I want 4 two's... and I want them
  all on my back.
Glenda  (quietly) Okay...
Ross  Wait a minute, there's two sets of nozzles, which one
  is it?
Ross  Which... which... which... Which one is it?
Ross  OH! SON OF A BITCH!
[Scene  Joey and Rachel's]
Rachel  What is the matter with us?
Joey  Well, I know what's the matter with me.
Rachel  No, I mean with us, you know. I mean, is it supposed
  to be this... difficult?
Joey  I don't know.
Chandler  That fake British woman is a real bitch, but she
  sure can dance... Hey!
Rachel  Hi! Hey, listen, can we ask you a question? When
  you and Monica first hooked up, was it weird going from friends to... more
  than that?
Chandler  Kinda... you know, sneaking around, having to hide
  from you guys...
Rachel  No, no, no... No, I mean... se-x-u-ally...
Joey  Yeah, was there a part of you that... felt like it
  was... really wrong?
Chandler  Actually, no. No, it felt right. You know, it felt
  like uhm... I can't believe we haven't been doing this the whole time.
Chandler  I can tell from your expressions that that's the
  good news you were hoping for... Well, I'm gonna go continue to... spread the
  joy.(Chandler leaves the apartment. Joey sighs)
Rachel  Well, just because it happened that way for them
  doesn't mean it has to happen that way for us.
Joey  Yeah, yeah... Absolutely. I mean, just because something's
  difficult doesn't mean that you quit.
Rachel  Right, totally.
Joey  Yeah, so we just keep trying and trying until we...
  do it.
Rachel  Yeah, and if doesn't work, then we'll be just one
  of those couples that never have sex.
Joey  That's a... pla-an.
Joey  (sighs) Wow... I did not see this coming.
Rachel  Hmmm... Me too...
Rachel  I wonder how Monica and Chandler could do it?
Joey  I guess they weren't as good friends as we are.
Rachel  Aah... I bet you're right.
Joey  So...
Rachel  Yeah.
Joey  I love ya.
Rachel  Love you too... Alright, I'm going to bed.
Joey  Yeah, me too.
Joey  Ooh, yeah, I'm not going anywhere for a while.
[Scene  Ross's apartment.]
Chandler  Dude, it's Chandler. Let me in.
Ross  Go away! I don't want to see anybody.
Chandler  I know, I went to the tanning place and the same
  thing happened to me. You have to let me in.
Ross  Really? Did you count Mississipily?
Ross  Dude, you're not tanned.
Chandler  No, I just had to get a picture of this.
Chandler  I see you later!
[Scene  Central Perk]
Monica  (she enters) Hey guys!
Ross, Rachel and Chandler  Hey!
Chandler  Honey, I got us that room at the Woodford Inn this weekend.
Monica  That place in Vermont? You can  take
  a hint!
Rachel  Wait, you can't go away this weekend! It's Emma's birthday!
Ross  Yeah!
Rachel  We're having a party.
Monica  Well, can't you just have the party when we get back?
Ross  No.
Rachel  No, 
  that day... that won't be her real birthday!
Chandler  Gee if only she were one and had no idea what the hell a birthday 
  was!
Ross  C'mon you guys, this is really important to us.
Monica  Well, I'm sorry, but Chandler and I could really use a weekend away. 
  You know, to reconnect... emotionally.
Chandler  There's this thing I really want us to do. I read about it in Maxim...
Rachel  Well, can't you just go to Vermont the next day?
Ross  Yeah, we want everyone to be there. As much as I hate to delay your doing 
  weird sex stuff to my little sister.
Rachel  And I mean, you know, you guys... This is a big deal. I mean, how can 
  we have her first birthday party without her aunt and her uncle!
Monica  All right, we'll stay. We can just drive up after the party.
Chandler  Fine, but if we end up not doing this Maxim thing because of this 
  party...
Monica  Believe me, that is not why we won't 
  be doing that!
[Scene  Rachel and Joey's apartment]
Rachel  You know Pheebs, when I was little, on my birthday, my daddy would 
  hide a present in every room of the house, and then he would draw a treasure 
  map to help me find 'em all.
Phoebe  Oooh, I love family traditions like that. When uhm... 
  when Ursula and I were kids, on our birthday, our stepdad would sell his blood 
  to buy us food!
Ross  (he enters) Hey guys!
Rachel and Phoebe  Hi!
Ross  Hey, I brought the camera for Emma's video.
Rachel  Oh, good, good! We had this idea to make a birthday video for Emma 
  and we'll give it to her when she is 18.
Phoebe  Oh, COOL!! Wow, it's like a time capsule!
Ross  Yeah!
Phoebe  Oh, just think... she's gonna be watching that video on a TV that hasn't 
  even been invented yet! With friends who right now are just like babies! And 
  they'll be living in a floating city that the humans built to escape the ant 
  people!
Ross  That's the hope! So, is Emma awake yet?
Rachel  Oh no, it's still nap time. But she'll be up soon.
Ross  Ah, and where is Joey?
Rachel  I said it's still nap time.
Ross  (taping Joey with the cam) Hey, there is uncle Joey!
Joey  Hey!
Ross  Hey, say something to Emma on her 18th birthday!
Joey  What, what!? it's for her hot friends!
Ross  When they see this you'll be 52!
Joey  And starting to think about settling down!
Rachel  Hey Joey, will you please set this up for people to put Emma's presents 
  on?
Phoebe  Yeah! I wrote Emma a song.
Joey  Oh, yeah! How was I supposed to know?
Phoebe  Joey, it's a birthday party.
Joey  Yeah, but for a one-year-old. What's the point... the other day she laughed 
  for like an hour at a cup. Just a cup with a picture of Elmo on it dressed as 
  a farmer. And he's standing next to this cow and the cow says "El-moo"! 
  (Joey starts laughing) Yeah... that's a funny cup!
Monica  Hey!
Chandler  Hey hey! Where's the birthday girl?
Rachel  Oh, she's still napping
Chandler  Oh, sure, she was probably up all night, excited about the party 
  she knows is happening.
Rachel  Look, I know that you guys really want to get to Vermont and this isn't 
  a really big deal to you, but it really is to us, ok? Emma will never have a 
  first birthday again.
Monica  All right... you're right. We're sorry. Now let's wake up Emma and 
  get the fun time started!
Rachel  No really, she didn't sleep well last night, so we can't wake her up.
Monica  Are you freaking kidding me, Green?
Jack and Judy  HI!
Ross  (points the camcorder towards them to record their entrance) Hey!
Monica  So glad you came!
Jack  I can't believe Emma is already one!
Joey  Hey Mr. and Mrs. Geller! Let me help you with that.
Jack  Thank you!
Joey  Oh man, this is great, uh? The three of us together again! You know what 
  would be fun? If we gave this present to Emma from all of us!
Jack  Which one are you?
Monica  I can't believe Emma is still asleep!
Chandler  I know, what are we gonna do?
Monica  I've got a plan. I've got a plan. I'm going to ram this platter really 
  hard into your ribs. You're gonna scream out and that'll wake her up!
Chandler  I'm not going to Vermont with this Monica!
Joey  No, no, no! My talents as an actor!
Phoebe  Oh!
Joey  You know, I could like maybe... I could do a dramatic reading of one 
  of her books!
Phoebe  Or you could stick a fork in an apple!
Joey  Hey, I think Emma might like it!
Rachel  Oh! Emma might like what?
Joey  Um, my present!
Rachel  What did you get her?
Joey  Actually we prepared performances.
Phoebe  Separate performances.
Joey  But equally real!
Rachel  Well, this sounds like fun! Well, you know what? Actually? People are 
  getting a little antsy waiting Emma to wake up from her nap, so would you mind 
  performing them once now?
Phoebe  Sure, yeah!
Joey  (unconfidently) O K.
Rachel  (to everybody) All right, let’s get this party started, huh? 
  Joey and Phoebe are gonna perform a little something for us.
Ross  Oh, great!
Phoebe  (to Joey) Are you gonna be embarrassed going up there having nothing 
  prepared?
Joey  Hey, I do it every week with three cameras pointed at me and a whole 
  crew waiting!
Rachel  So, Joey, what are you gonna do for us?
Joey  I will be doing a dramatic reading of one of Emma’s books.
Rachel  Oh, ok, which one?
Joey  Uh, why, it’s a... (he picks a book up) one of her favorites, uh, 
  (he reads the title of the book) “Riding the Storm Out. Coping with post-partum 
  depression” eesh! (he puts the book back and picks up another) “Love 
  you forever”. Love you forever. By Robert Munsch. Published by Firefly 
  books. Printed (he pauses and changes the tone to a dramatic one) in Mexico. 
  A mother held her new baby and very slowly rocked him back and forth, back and 
  forth, back and forth, and while she held him she sang “I’ll love 
  you forever, I’ll like you for always, as long as I'm living, my baby 
  you’ll be”. (the picture fades and Joey is now finishing the book). 
  And while he rocked her, he sang “I’ll love you forever, I’ll 
  like you for always, as long as I'm living, my baby you’ll be”.
Rachel  (crying) Wow! That was amazing!
Ross  Thank you so much for that gift!
Chandler (nearly weeping)  I was not ready for this today!
Ross  Amazing... amazing.
Rachel  Oh, Phoebe, I’m sorry! Phoebe has prepared something as well.
Phoebe  That’s right, I've prepared a song for Emma. From my heart to 
  hers. For there’s no greater gift, than the gift of music. (she starts 
  singing) Emma! Your name poses a dilemma. 'Cause not much else rhymes with Emma! 
  Maybe the actor Richard Crenna, he played the commanding officer in Rambo. Happy 
  birthday Emma!
Rachel  Is that it?
Phoebe  No, of course not! I also, you know, prepared a reading (she picks 
  up a book). “Sex and the single mother. (pause) Finding your G-spot.
Everybody  No, no, no, no, no!
[Scene  Joey’s Apartment. Ross is filming his parents ]
Judy  Hello Emma. Happy eighteenth birthday.
Jack  Right now that seems so far away, seventeen years.
Judy  Yes, you’ll be all grown up by then. We’ll be... Well your 
  grandfather and I might not be here.
Jack  That’s true! This message could becoming to you from beyond the 
  grave, Emma!
Judy  After all, my parents died very young.
Jack  And my cholesterol’s off the charts!
Judy  Remember, Emma, heart disease kills women too!
Ross (stops recording)  Ok, cut! Great. That was... that was 
  just... yeah!
Rachel  Ross, um, don’t forget to get a shot of Emma’s cake. It’s 
  in a box in the fridge.
Ross  Sure.
Rachel  Oh, you're gonna love this cake. I got it from a bakery in New Jersey, 
  Corino’s.
Monica  Oh my God, that place has the creamiest frosting! I use to hitchhike 
  there when I was a kid.
Rachel  Well, anyway, they make these great novelty cakes, in all different 
  shapes, and if you give them a photo, they’ll copy it in icing!
Monica  Oh, did you do a picture of Emma?
Rachel  Yes! On a cake shaped like a bunny.
Ross  Uh, Rach? Does this bakery by any chance also bake erotic cakes? Say 
  for bachelorette parties?
Rachel  Ross, what are you talking about? (she sees the cake) oh! Oh my God! 
  They put my baby’s face on a penis!
Phoebe (sees the cake)  oh! Now it’s a party!
Rachel  Why you guys this isn't funny, all right? If I wanted this cake to 
  be a disaster I would have baked it myself!
Joey (staring at the cake)  Uh.. is it ok that I still think it looks delicious?
Judy (to Jack) Jack, look at this.
Jack  I know what you're thinking Judy, the resemblance is uncanny!
Ross  I am this close to tugging on my testicles again.
Rachel (on the phone)  No, no, this is not what I ordered. 
  Ok? I went all the way to New Jersey so that I could have the perfect cake for 
  my daughter’s birthday and I need a bunny cake, right now!
Ross  Ask them if it would be faster if we cut the baby’s face off the 
  penis, so we can put it on the bunny. (pause). That is a weird sentence!
Rachel  Oh! Believe you me! I am going to bring this cake back, I don't even 
  want it in my home... (Turns towards the cake and sees Joey trying to take a 
  piece and yells at him) Joey, don't touch it!!
Joey  I'm so confused!
Rachel  (speaking to the person on the phone again) Yes, yes. I still want 
  my daughters picture, but on a bunny cake. Yellow cake, chocolate frosting with 
  nuts!
Chandler  To be fair this one does have nuts.
Ross  Hey Mon, that was really nice of you to loan Rachel your car so she could 
  go and get the cake.
Monica  Oh. So nice of her to pull my hair, 'till I dropped the key!
Ross  Well, you know what? While we're waiting, you guys could tape your message 
  to Emma for her 18th birthday, huh? (takes the camcorder and points it at Monica 
  and Chandler) Ok!
Chandler  Hi Emma! It's the year 2020. Are you still enjoying your nap?
Monica  We're Aunt Monica and uncle Chandler, by the way.
  You may not recognize us, because we haven't spoken to your parents in seventeen years!
Chandler  We used to be married, but then we missed a weekend away together 
  and things kind of unraveled. Because of you! Happy Birthday. (Ross looks disappointed 
  and switches the camcorder off)
Monica  Ross, Rachel promised it would be over by now. We seriously have to 
  go, if we want to get to Vermont. I called them and the last train leaves in 
  a half hour.
Phoebe  And you know, I have a massage client soon.
Ross  You guys, just please.. a little bit longer. I promise, Rachel will be 
  back with the cake any minute. Monica, remember.. the frosting? huh?
Monica  Alright, 5 more minutes.
Ross  (Into receiver) Hello? (listens) Oh no! What happened? (listens some 
  more) Ok ok, where are you? (Grabs a pen and starts writing). Ok, I'll be right 
  there. (Puts the phone down)
Chandler  Was that Emma? Is she up?
Ross  No, Rachel got pulled over for speeding. She forgot 
  her licence so now I have to bring it to her.
Phoebe  Well, if you're leaving, I'm definitely gonna
go.
Monica  No! Wait! If anybody gets to go.. it's us (Points at herself and Chandler) 
  We've been complaining the longest!
Ross  No, wait ! You guys, no, no, you can't leave! Rachel already feels bad 
  that the cake's messed up. How do you think she's gonna feel when she comes 
  back here and all you guys are gone?
Chandler  I don't know! You'll tell us on Monday!
Ross  Joey! You're in charge, ok? You make sure nobody leaves! (leaves)
Joey  Got it! (Goes towards the front door
  and stands with his back to it) Hey hey hey! (to Chandler) Where do you think you're going?
Chandler  To the bathroom!
Joey  Alright, well the rest of you get comfortable, ok, because we're gonna 
  be here for a li...(stops and thinks) Wait a minute, there is a window in there!
Phoebe  Oh no! He's not getting away that easy! (Phoebe and Joey run towards 
  the bathroom and enter)
Chandler  (Yelling) What are you doing? Get the hell out of here! (Phoebe and 
  Joey come out looking shocked)
Joey  Well, that one did not have Emma's face on it.
Phoebe  No, it did not.
Joey  No.
Judy  Well, we better get going, it's late. Jack's not allowed to drive at 
  night anymore. He has trouble staying in his lane.
Jack  Last winter I went up on a church lawn and drove right through a manger 
  scene. The papers thought it was a hate crime.
Judy  Anyway, it was lovely seeing you.
Joey  Ok! (Opens the door for them)
Judy  Bye... Bye dear.
Joey  Nighty-night!
Judy  Nighty-night!
Joey  Bye, bye.
Phoebe  Joey? How could you just let them leave?
Joey  Hey, hey, hey, hey! I'm not gonna mess with Jack, he's a great man, he 
  fought for our country.
Monica  No, he didn't! He pretended to be a Quaker to get out of Korea.
Joey  (Shocked) Oh! Well that's it! He's the last one to go. I'm locking you 
  guys in. (turns the bolts of the door, thereby locking it)
Chandler  You do know, I can just turn them the other way around, right?
Joey  Oh! I forgot you used to live here!
Joey  Hello?
Estelle  (on the other side of the line) Joey! It's Estelle!
Joey  Hey! (smiles)
Estelle  So, how did your audition go today?
Joey  (smile fades) What audition?
Estelle  The one I told you about last week?
Joey  What? You never said anything about an audition!
Estelle  (Looks confused) Let me start over. I just got a call about an audition. 
  I think you can still make it. It's down at the Astor Theatre and you need to 
  have a monologue prepared.
Joey  A monologue? I don't have.. (sees the book he was reading before for 
  his "dramatic reading") I got it. (hangs up) (announces to the room) 
  Aah! so... I'm gonna take off!
Phoebe  Wh.. what? No wait, you don't get to leave! I've got a massage client 
  waiting outside my door any minute!
Monica  Yeah, and we've paid for a room, that we're supposed to be in right 
  now!
Phoebe  Well, oh, ok now... Only one of us has to stay with Emma. Ok, and as 
  the person who realized that, I get to go!
Monica  No! no! Let's figure out a fair way to decide who's staying.
Joey  Oh! I got it! Ok, everyone pick a number from one to ten. Alright? Whoever 
  gets the highest number gets to go first.
Monica  (She gives Joey a you-are-so-stupid-look) Ok, ten.
Joey  Okay, Monica picks ten, I call nine! Anyone else?
Phoebe  No, lets just draw straws.
Joey  Or.. we could flip a coin, and then multiply the..
Chandler  I'm begging you stop.
Joey  Right.
Phoebe  (Visibly excited) Yeah!! Let's do that!
Chandler  (Also very excited) That sounds more fun than the thing we were going 
  to do in Vermont!
Monica  Everybody get your toys! (They all run toward the table with toys)
Phoebe  Ok! I want the dolphin!
Chandler  Thats a bear.
Phoebe  I'm too excited!
Monica  Phoebe, you get the bear, uhm, Joey, you get the robot, and Chandler 
  and I get the dog. Ok, and the race is going to go (Takes two cups and marks 
  the start and finish lines with them) from here to here. Now the one who comes 
  in last, stays!
Joey  Ok, ladies and gentlemen, wind your toys! (they do so)
Chandler  Ok, on your mark... Get set... GO!!!
Phoebe  Go! Go!
Joey  Come on robot!
Monica  (to the dog) What are you barking at?
Monica  Wha... How the hell is that gonna help?
Chandler  I bought you. How did I forget that that's all you do?
Joey  Way to go robot!
Phoebe  Good job Alan!
Joey  Hey, good race you guys.
Phoebe  Yeah, see you later!
Monica  No! No, no... wait! We didn't lose. (turns to Chandler) The rules clearly 
  stated that the last one to cross the finish line was the loser. Well, our dog 
  never crossed the finish line, so technically...
Chandler  They left.
[ Scene  The freeway. Rachel is driving Monica's Porsche, while 
  using her mobile phone. Ross is sitting next to her.]
Ross  RACHEL!
Rachel  OOH! God! Sorry!
Ross  (sarcastically) I can't believe they gave you a ticket. You're such a 
  good driver.
Rachel  Emma's awake.
Ross  Yeah?
Rachel  I can't believe this. This is her first birthday. She's awake. We're 
  not even there. Everybody left. We still have this stupid obscene cake.
Ross  Hey, maybe I can fix that, you know. Try to turn it into something else. 
  (he opens the box)
Rachel  Oh, why do you even bother? I already ruined her first birthday... 
  And do you know how important these early experiences are Ross? Very! According 
  to the back cover of that book that you gave me.
Ross  Rach, she's not going to remember this.
Rachel  (shakes her head) I guess... Oh, I just had such an idea of what this 
  day would be like, you know? Emma laughing and everybody gathered around her 
  cake singing "Happy Birthday". Then we would all go into... HEY GET 
  OUT OF THE ROAD YOU STUPID STUDENT DRIVER!!! (honks furiously, and Ross looks 
  at her in disbelief and Rachel looks at him.) They have to learn!
Ross  (looks back at the cake) Hey!
Rachel  What?
Ross  It's not bad.
Rachel  (she looks at the cake) Oh my God! Look what... you made it into a 
  bunny. How did you do that?
Ross  Well, I just made these two things uhm... cheeks. And then I split this 
  to make ears.
Rachel  Well, I'm very impressed.
Ross  Some can sing, some can dance. I apparently can turn phallic cakes into 
  woodland creatures.
[ Scene  Rachel and Joey's apartment. Chandler, Monica and Emma 
  are sitting on the floor, and Emma's stuffed animals are lined up in front of 
  them.]
Chandler  I'm sorry, is this a game for Emma or for Monica?
Monica  Game?
Chandler  Emma, you even know it's your birthday today? You're one! One-year-old, 
  that's little.
Chandler  Ooh! That's my girl!
Monica  That's how old you are.
Chandler  Did I teach her that? Did I just... impart wisdom?
Monica  (embraces Emma tightly) Ooh, I want one...
Chandler  Me too...
Chandler  There's no-one around. Why don't we just take this one?
Monica  ...and head to Canada!
Chandler  I was kidding.
Monica  I wasn't. Let's get going!
Phoebe  Hey, are Ross and Rachel back?
Chandler  No, not yet.
Phoebe  Oh good, I didn't miss the party.
Monica  What about your massage client?
Phoebe  I just felt so bad, missing this. So I just slipped him a little something, 
  you know. As long as I'm back in five or six hours, it will be alright.
Joey  Okay, if Ross and Rachel ask, I've been here the whole time. THE WHOLE 
  TIME!
Joey  (to Ross and Rachel) I've been here the whole time!
Ross  Joey, we just saw you come in. You ran past us on the stairs.
Rachel  I don't care that you left. I'm just glad that you're here. Thanks 
  you guys!
Chandler  Hey, guys! Come on! You gotta see what Emma just did.
Rachel  What?
Chandler  Emma, how old are you? How old are you today? (holds up his index 
  finger again)
Emma  Wo-ish. (and holds up her finger)
Rachel  Oh! Emma, that's right! You're that many!
Ross  Oh my God! Our daughter's a genius! Rach, this means...
Rachel  (angrily) NO, no science camp!
Ross  Damnit! I'll put a candle on the cake.
Rachel  Oh!... Oh and Emma, look at your stuffed animals lined up so neatly!
Monica  Thanks!
Ross  Okay, here we go! Emma's first birthday cake... Well hey... well, blow 
  out the candle. Come on Emma.
Chandler  Let's do it, come on!
Ross  What's wrong? Are you okay?
Rachel  Oh yeah, nothing! These are happy tears! This is just what I wanted.
Phoebe  (pointing at cake) Hey, you made it into a bunny.
Joey  What is wrong with me. It looked more delicious when it 
  was a penis.
[Scene  Rachel and Joey's apartment. It's just Ross and Rachel. 
  They put the camera on a tripod in the kitchen and they are standing in front 
  of the camera.]
Ross  Okay, you ready?
Rachel  Yeah.
Ross  A-a-and... record.
Rachel  Okay. (they both look into the camera, and Ross waves.) Hi Emma. Well, 
  your first birthday is over, and it was really...
Phoebe  (yelling at the top of her voice) Go, go, go Alan! Run you, hairy bastard!
[Scene  Central Perk]
Rachel  You know, I'm thinking about letting Emma have her 
  first cookie.
Joey  Her first cookie? She has cookies all the time!
Rachel  I've never given her a cookie. Have you?
Joey  No! No... and, for the record, I've also never given her a frosting from 
  a can!
Monica  Hey Rach, the adoption agency needs letters of recommendation and we 
  were wondering if you would write one for us.
Rachel  Of course, I'd be honored!
Chandler  Thanks!
Monica  Thank you!
Joey  U-U-Um, I think there's been an oversight.
Chandler  Joey, we would've asked you, we just thought you wouldn't be interested.
Monica  Yeah, it's just we don't think of you as really being so much "with 
  the words".
Joey  Whoo-weh hey weh-hey whoo hey!!
Monica  Clearly we were wrong.
Joey  I gotta a lot of nice stuff to say about you guys, ok? And I know how 
  much you wanna have a baby, you know, and I would love to help you get one.
Monica  You know what? Then, Joey, we want you to do it.
Joey  Thank you! Alright, let me see how I'm gonna start... "Dear baby 
  adoption decider people..."
Chandler  So excited about your letter!
Phoebe  Hey!
All  Hey Phoebe!
Joey  Hey!
Monica  Wow! Don't you look nice?!
Phoebe  Yes, I do! Today is Mike and my one-year anniversary.
Rachel  OH! What's it the anniversary of? Your first date, your first kiss, 
  first time you had sex...
Phoebe  YEAH!
Chandler  So you must be going to somewhere fancy to celebrate?
Phoebe  Uh-uh. Ehm, a Knicks game.
Joey  Uhm... Aren't you a little overdressed?
Phoebe  Hey, you know what, I've never had a one-year anniversary before, so 
  no matter where we go, I'm wearing something fancy pants, and... I'm gonna put 
  on my finest jewelry and we're gonna have sex in a public rest room.
Monica  You guys do that? Chandler won't even have sex in
our bathroom!
Chandler  That's where people make number two!!
[Scene  Ross' apartment. Ross is grading papers. Charlie approaches 
  him.]
Charlie  Hey! (They kiss and cuddle a little)
Ross  Hey...
Charlie  So, you know... I have a little time. If you... if you want to...
Ross  (surprised) Oh... (he pauses) (sounds disappointed) Ohh... I'd love to 
  but I really have to grade these papers.
Charlie  Fine, it's fine... (she whispers) I'll just shower by myself...
Ross  (Writing on the papers) B, B, B, B, B!
Charlie  Oh, Ross, you gave a B to a Pottery Barn catalogue.
Ross  Well, it had some good ideas, take off your shirt.
Ross  Damnit!
Amy  (yelling from outside) Rachel!! Open up!! It's your sister!! (she knocks 
  on the door again) I have to talk to you!!
Ross  (he opens the door) Hi Amy!
Amy  You're not Rachel.
Ross  Still sharp as a tack!
Amy  Um... Charlie, this is Rachel's sister Amy. Amy, this is Charlie.
Charlie  Hi!
Amy  Hi!
Charlie  Nice to meet you.
Amy  H-Hi!!(to Ross) And you are...?
Ross  (pause) Ross? I... I grew up on your block! We had Thanksgiving together 
  last year... I had a baby with your sister!
Amy  (looks confused) N-no... uhm... did I buy a falafel from you yesterday?
Ross  (gives up) Yes, yes, you did.
[Scene  Joey and Rachel's apartment]
Ross  Hi Rachel! Here's your sister Amy! She thinks I need
  pec implants!
Rachel  Amy! Hi! Oh-oh-hoh! (they hug) Wow! You remember Joey?
Amy  Yeah! Hey, sure! The "Days of Our Lives" guy!
Joey  That's right, yeah.
Amy  You're not good!
Joey  Always nice to meet a fan!
Rachel  So now, what are you doing here?
Amy  Well, I have huge news.
Rachel  (Emma starts crying in the other room) Oh sorry, hold on. Let me just 
  check on the baby!
Amy  Wait, this is important! Can Ella wait? (Rachel goes to Emma)
Ross  Ehm... Her name is Emma.
Amy  Why did you change it, Ella was so much prettier!
Ross  What do I know? I just sell Middle Eastern food from a cart!
Amy  Hey, your English is getting better!!
Ross  (to Joey) Oh my God!
Joey  I know, she may be the hottest girl I've ever hated.
Ross  What... what you working on?
Joey  (using a laptop) Oh, Monica and Chandler's recommendation. I want it 
  to sound smart but.. I don't know any big words or anything, so...
Ross  Why don't you use your Thesaurus?
Joey  What did I just say?
Ross  Watch. (he takes the laptop) Here, you ehm... You highlight the word 
  you want to change.
  Go under Tools and the Thesaurus generates... 'gives'... 'gives' a whole list 
  of choices. You can pick the word that sounds smartest.
Joey  Oh my God, that's great! I'm smart!! No, no, I'm... (he uses the Thesaurus) 
  "brainy, bright, clever", I love this thing! Look out ladies, Joey 
  Tribbiani's got the whole package!!
[Scene  Rachel's room. Rachel is attending to Emma. Amy is standing 
  behind her.]
Amy  So beautiful.
Rachel  Oh, I know, isn't she?
Amy  No, I was talking about your bedding.
Rachel  All right. What's your news, Amy?
Amy  Oh! Um... Well... I'm getting married.
Rachel  What? Oh my God! To who?
Amy  This guy! He has a killer apartment.
Rachel  A-And??
Amy  A-And it's on Fifth. And the elevator opens up right into the living room.
Rachel  No, what's he like?
Amy  Oh! He's ok. Do you remember my old boyfriend Mark?
Rachel  Yeah.
Amy  It's his dad.
Rachel  Huh... wow, so he's gotta be...
Amy  Old? Yeah! But he travels a lot, so he's hardly ever there.
Rachel  Sweety, I gotta tell ya... it sounds a little bit like you like the 
  apartment more than you like...
Amy  Myron. Hmm... I told you he was old!
Rachel  Oh... sit down, sit down. Oh, honey, you know, I once also almost married 
  somebody that I didn’t love. Do you remember Barry?
Amy  Humpf, remember him? How we used to make out all the time after you went 
  to sleep.
Rachel  Sometimes just nodding is ok. (pause) Uhm, so but
  anyway, listen, not marrying Barry was the best decision that I ever, ever
  made. Honey, you deserve
  true love. Your soulmate is out there, somewhere. Someone that is your age,
  that is smart, that is fun and that you care about!
Amy  (thinks about it) You’re right, you’re right! I’m gonna 
  do it!
Rachel  Ok.
Amy  I’m gonna marry Myron and keep looking
  for Mr
Right.
Rachel  Ok, let’s keep talking.
[Scene  Madison Square Garden. Mike and Phoebe are walking to 
  their seats.]
Mike  I know. This has been the best year... (the crowd starts cheering so 
  he starts yelling) THIS HAS BEEN THE BEST YEAR OF MY LIFE!
Phoebe  ME TOO! I NEVER THOUGHT I COULD LOVE SOMEONE THIS MUCH!
Mike  I FEEL THE SAME WAY!
Phoebe  YOU’RE SO GENEROUS AND KIND AND (crowd stops cheering) YOU'RE 
  AMAZING IN BED (everyone hears it and stare at them.) (to everybody) IT’S 
  OUR ANNIVERSARY!
Announcer  Knicks fans, please turn your attention to the 
  big screen on the score board. Someone has a special question to ask. (on the 
  screen there’s written ‘Julie, will you marry me?’ and goes 
  on to show a guy kneeling down in front of a girl holding out a ring to her)
Phoebe  Oh how lame... oh, it’s so tacky, and impersonal.
Mike  Really?
Phoebe  Oh, it’s the worst way to propose!
Mike  (looks strangely shocked) Excuse me... (he leaves, then Phoebe realizes 
what she did).
[Scene  Monica’s apartment. Joey enters the room]
Joey  Hey, finished my recommendation. (he hands it over to 
  Chandler) Here. And I think you’ll be very, very happy. It’s the 
  longest I ever spent on a computer without looking at porn.
Chandler  (reading) I don’t... uh... understand.
Joey  (sounding very proud of himself) Some of the words are a little too sophisticated 
  for ya?
Monica  (also reading it) It doesn’t make any sense.
Joey  Of course it does! It’s smart! I used the the-saurus!
Chandler  On every word?
Joey  Yep!
Monica  Alright, what was this sentence originally? (shows the sentence to 
  Joey)
Joey  Oh, ‘They are warm, nice, people with big hearts’.
Chandler  And that became ‘they are humid prepossessing Homo Sapiens 
  with full sized aortic pumps...?
Joey  Yeah, yeah and hey, I really mean it, dude.
Monica  Hey Joey, I don’t think we can use this.
Joey  Why not?
Monica  Well, because you signed it baby kangaroo Tribbiani (Joey makes a 'and-what’s-wrong-with-that' 
  look). Hey, why don’t you stop worrying about sounding smart and just 
  be yourself!
Chandler  You know what? You don’t need a thesaurus, just write from 
here, (points at his own heart) your full sized aortic pump.
[Scene  The corridor. Amy knocks Joey’s door and Rachel 
  opens the door.]
Rachel  Amy, hi!
Amy  I took your advice, I left Myron.
Rachel  Oh, good for you!
Amy  I know! I'm Erin Brockovich!
Rachel  Yes you are! Oh, I am so proud of you!
Amy  Thank you! So, can I stay with you?
Rachel  But Erin Brockovich had her own house.
Joey  Ah, look who’s back! (he sees the bags) Why do you have bags? RACH, 
  WHY DOES SHE HAVE BAGS?
Amy  Well, I’m staying with you guys!
Joey  What?
Amy  We’re gonna be roomies! (she snaps her finger and points at Joey, 
snaps her fingers again and points to the bags) Come on!
[Scene  Joey’s apartment. Rachel is in the living room 
  and Joey comes out of his room.]
Joey  You slept out here?
Rachel  Yeah... Amy kept kicking me in her sleep yelling ‘Myron, get 
  off!’
Joey  But uhm, we're getting rid of her, right? Rach, please tell me we’re 
  getting rid of her.
Rachel  Joey, I can’t do that!
Joey  Oh, come on! Last night I was finishing off a pizza and she said (aping 
  Amy badly) "Uoh oh oh, a moment on the lips, forever on the hips!" 
  I don’t need that kind of talk in my house!
Rachel  Well Joey, uhm look, I know that she’s difficult, but I think 
  it’s really good that she’s here.
Joey  'Cause we will appreciate it more when she’s gone?
Rachel  No, it's just... look, you know, when I first moved to the city I was 
  a lot like her! I was spoiled, self-centered and you guys really took care of 
  me.
Joey  Yeah, Monica made us!
Rachel  Well, uhm... whatever, I have really appreciated it, 'cause I don’t 
  think I would be the person that I am today if it wasn’t for you guys. 
  See, I wanna help Amy the way you guys helped me. And I know it’s gonna 
  take patience, but that’s ok.
Amy  Good morning.
Joey  Yeaah.
Rachel  Amy, that’s what I was supposed to wear today, that’s why 
  I hung it on the door.
Amy  Oh, sweety, you can’t pull this off.
Rachel  Amy, you know what? I was thinking that maybe now it'd be a good time 
  for us to sit down and, you know, talk about your future.
Amy  Oh, I can’t, honey. I’m gonna go get my eyebrows shaped. (points 
  at her eyebrows) I am not happy. (to Joey who has a pizza box in his hands) 
  Oh... sure you wanna eat that?
Joey  (yelling at her) I’M CURVY, AND I LIKE IT!
[Scene  Monica’s Apartment. Rachel, Ross, Monica and Chandler 
  are there, Phoebe enters the room]
Phoebe  Hi. I just had the worst anniversary ever.
Chandler  I doubt that! Tell her about us last
year.
Monica  Oh, well, I bought Chandler a five hundred dollar watch and he wrote 
  me a rap song.
Ross  Seriously?
Chandler  Word!
Phoebe  Well, mine was worse than that.
Rachel  Well, what happened?
Phoebe  We were at the game, and this guy proposed to his girlfriend on the 
  big screen thing...
Rachel  Oh, that is so tacky.
Phoebe  Well, that’s what I said, but it turns out, Mike was planning 
  on proposing to me that same way last night!
Monica  Oh my God, Mike was gonna propose?
Rachel  Phoebe, that’s huge!
Ross  Well, do you wanna marry him?
Phoebe  Yeah, I really do! Yes, but, after I dumped on the way he was gonna 
  propose to me, I don’t think he’s ever gonna ask again! I mean, 
  I said no in Barbados and now this!
Chandler  She's right! If I were a guy and... (stops himself
  mid-sentence...everyone stares at him) Did I just say if I were a
  guy..?
Monica  Maybe you don't need him to propose to you, maybe you can propose to 
  him!
Phoebe  Oh, I don't know, I don't know, isn't that a little desperate?
Monica  I proposed to Chandler! (Phoebe stops herself from laughing) Alright, 
  moving on...
Chandler  Oh, I don't think it was desperate, I think it was amazing!
Monica  Thank you.
Phoebe  (To Rachel and Ross) Well, do you think
  I should propose?
Rachel  I think it could be kind of great!
Ross  Absolutely! You'll love the feeling! There's nothing like it!
Phoebe  Ok, ok, so how should I do it?
Monica  How about at a game, on the big screen?
Rachel  (Sarcastically) Uuuh!! How about at a Footlocker? (claps her hands 
  together, faking excitement)
Monica  What? what? He obviously thinks that's a nice way to be proposed to, 
  plus he'd never suspect it!
Phoebe  Yeah, that does make sense. Ok, now, would... would you two (points 
  to Ross and Chandler) like that?
Chandler  Sounds good to me... but what would a guy think?
Amy  (To Rachel) Nana is on the phone (Hands the phone over to Rachel)
Rachel  (Takes the phone) Oh! That's interesting, since she died seven years 
  ago!!
Amy  She did? Who got her condo in Boca?
Rachel  (Into the phone) Hello? (announces to Amy) Oh, it's our nanny! (goes 
  back to the phone conversation) Hi! Oh... God! I hope you feel better! Ok, bye! 
  (Hangs up) (To Ross) That's Molly, she's sick. Can you watch Emma today?
Ross  No, I can't. I have back-to-back classes. Did Molly say what she had? 
  Because my throat's been hurting?
Rachel  Menstrual cramps.
Ross  I don't think that's what this is.
Rachel  (To Monica, Chandler and Phoebe) Can any of you watch Emma?
Monica  No, sorry sweety..
Phoebe  No, I've got work and then I'm proposing..
Rachel  (To Ross) Great, shoot, what are we gonna do?
Amy  Well, I can do it.
Rachel  (Thinks for a moment) Well, actually...
Ross  (He interrupts her immediately, and drags her by her arm to the other 
  side of the room) Well, can I talk to you for a sec.?
Rachel  Yeah.
Ross  Um, I do not want her baby-sitting our child.
Rachel  Why not?
Ross  Fine, we'll call the next one Ella.
Rachel  (Shocked) Wha... the next one?
Ross  (a little confused) Okay, um... I don't want her watching our baby.
Rachel  Ross, I am trying to help her become a better person. This is a huge 
  breakthrough for her! She just offered to do something for another human being!!
Ross  I... I don't know..
Rachel  Ross, I'm telling you, she's giving up getting her eyebrows (points 
  at her own to emphasize the word) shaped to do this alright? Do you understand 
  how important that is in our world?
Amy  um... listen, I couldn't help but overhear... 'cause I was trying to... 
  Listen, let me do this alright? I really wanna help you guys out, and plus Rachel's 
  been so wonderful to me... (looks at hem pleadingly)
Rachel  Absolutely.
Amy  (very excited) Oh! Great! So how much does it pay? (Ross just gives up 
and leaves)
[Scene  Central Perk. Joey is inside, Chandler and Monica walk 
  in.]
Chandler  Hey Joe! How's the second draft of the letter coming?
Joey  Great, I'm finished! In fact, I just dropped it off at the agency.
Monica  You dropped it off?
Joey  Yeah.
Chandler  Can we read it? Can you print out another copy?
Joey  No can do amigo. No, I didn't use the computer. Felt more personal to 
  hand-write it. (Chandler and Monica look even more shocked)
Monica  You hand-wrote it?
Joey  Yeah, and don't worry. I didn't try to sound smart at
  all! See ya later! (Leaves)
Monica  Oh my God, oh my God, that letter is gonna go in our 
  file! We're never gonna get a kid. No, we're gonna be one of those old couples 
  that collects orchids or has a lot of birds!
Chandler  It's ok, it's ok. You know what? (Takes out his mobile) I'll just 
  call the agency and tell them to throw out the letter. (starts dialing)
Monica  Okay good.
Chandler  (on the phone) Hello, this is Chandler Bing. Somebody just dropped 
  off a handwritten recommendation letter, and.. (listens) Uh-huh... Uh-huh... 
  okay... thank you. Good-bye. (hangs up looking very confused).
Monica  Ugh, we're screwed, aren't we? You know what? Just tell me on the way 
  to the bird store.
Chandler  (Still looks confused) They loved it.
Monica  What?
Chandler  They thought it was very smart of us to have a
  child write the recommendation letter.
Monica  (surprised) They thought Joey was a child?
Chandler  She guessed 8, 9, based on his drawings.
Amy  Hi!
Monica  Hey, what did you guys do today?
Amy  Ella wanted to go out, so we went shopping and got some sushi.
Chandler  That sounds like fun.
Amy  Yeah, not really. Babies are dull.
Rachel  (To Emma) Hey! Hi, how's my girl?
Amy  I'm fine! And, I got you a present for letting me stay with you. Ready?
Rachel  (sounds excited) Yeah!
Amy  Ta-daaa!
Rachel  (not excited anymore) You pierced her ears!?
Amy  (Very excited about it) Doesn't it make her nose look smaller?
Rachel  You pierced her ears? How could you do this without telling me?
Amy  Well, if I had told you, then it wouldn't have been surprise, now would 
  it?
Chandler  I think she looks cute. (Rachel turns around and stares at him angrily) 
  ... but I am wrong!
Rachel  Oh my God, Oh my God, here comes Ross. He's gonna flip out.
Amy  Why, did something happen to his falafel cart?
Rachel  Ugh. (takes the hat and covers Emma's head and half her face with it)
Ross  Hey Emma. Oh, why is she wearing her hat so low? She can barely see. 
  (Wants to take the hat off, but Rachel tries to stop him).
Rachel  Nah, I don't really want her to see.
Ross  Why not?
Monica  Because there are so many terrible sights in this world.
Chandler  Like war. Or that thing in Joey's refrigerator. Remember? It was 
  in a milk carton but it looked like meat?
Ross  Come here (Removes Emma's hat) Oh! There she is! Hi!
Ross  (sees how strangely Monica, Chandler and Rachel are looking at him) What?
Rachel  Nothing.
Ross  (Back to Emma) Hi! (Looks at her) What... (Moves the stroller away from 
  him so he can get a better look at her. He looks at her confused. Finally he 
  realizes the difference and gasps). Please tell me those are clip-ons.
Rachel  Oh, they're real!
Ross  Did she (points at Amy) do this to her? I told you we shouldn't have 
  left Emma with her!
Rachel  I know, I know, and you were right Ross. (To Amy)
  You are soo irresponsible
  I am never letting you baby-sit ever again!
Amy  Hey you know what, this kid needs me, okay? She needs 
  to have a cool fun aunt!
Monica  I'm a cool, fun aunt!
Amy  (Sarcastically) O-Okay!
Chandler  Hey! Monica can be cool and fun at organized indoor projects!
Rachel  I can't believe this. All I wanted to do was help you try to figure 
  out what to do with your life and this is how you repay me?
Amy  Well, I don't need you to help me, because I already know what I'm going 
  to do with my life.
Rachel  Oh yeah? Since when?
Amy  Since today... I am going to be a baby stylist.
Rachel  (looks at Ross and then at Amy again in disbelief) What?
Ross  That's not a thing!
Amy  Well, it should be. I'm gonna help babies learn how to accessorize, what 
  colors to wear, what clothes are slimming...
Rachel  (shouting) Babies don't care if they're slim.
Amy  Enter Amy!
Ross  (very angry) Amy, I ju... I just... I just wanna...
Amy  What? What are you gonna do?
Ross  (pointing at Amy, shouting) No more falafel for you!
[Scene  Madison Square Garden. Phoebe and Mike are watching the 
  game. There's cheering, but Phoebe seems distracted.]
Mike  Great game, huh?
Phoebe  Uhuh, uhuh... (seems distracted)
Mike  Why do you keep looking at the screen?
Phoebe  I'm not. I'm praying. (looking up) Please let the Knicks win... Thank 
  you Thor! (Mike is standing up) Where... where are you going?
Mike  Going go to the bathroom.
Phoebe  Well, I think you should wait.
Mike  Why?
Phoebe  Well, if you don't... if you don't hold it in, you don't get all the 
  nutrients.
Announcer  Knicks fans, please turn your attention to the 
  big screen on the scoreboard. Someone has a special question to ask.
(We see the screen where it says  "Mike will you marry me?" and then 
  we see Phoebe and Mike on the screen. Phoebe stands up and kneels in front of 
  Mike.)
Phoebe  Mike Hannigan... will you marry me? (Mike looks bewildered)
Announcer  Get a load of this... She's proposing
  to him. Guess we know who wears the pants in that family.
  (people are laughing, while
  Mike still seems bewildered)
Phoebe  That's not very enlightened!
Phoebe  Hey, hey! (shouting) Boo us? Boo you!
[Scene  Rachel and Joey's. Joey is in the kitchen and the telephone 
  rings.]
Joey  (picks up the phone) Hello? Yeah, this is Joey Tribbiani... 
  Oh, hi! Well, I'm glad you liked my letter... No my mommy and daddy aren't home 
  right now... (looks puzzled) Okay, bye bye. (hangs up) (to himself) She was 
  nice!
Rachel  Joey, get Amy's bags, she is moving out!
Joey  Whoo-hoo! (and leaves for Rachel's room)
Amy  You're kicking me out?
Rachel  You put holes in my baby's ears!
Amy  Yeah well, at least now people will know she is a girl!
Rachel  (gasps) I can't believe I ever even tried to help
  you. You are so  beyond help.
Amy  You know what? Ever since I got here, you have been nothing but negative.
Rachel  Excuse me?
Amy  You didn't want me to marry the old guy with the great apartment. Then, 
  I tried to help your daughter to de-emphasize her flaws (frantically pointing 
  at her nose) And suddenly I am the bad guy?
Rachel  (yelling) Joey, where are those bags?
Joey  (Yelling from Rachel's room) She has a lot of crap!
Rachel  (doesn't believe what she's hearing) Seriously?
Amy  hm-mmm... Mom said she gained like fifteen pounds.
Rachel  Hips or thighs?
Amy  Ass and face.
Rachel  (gasps) Oh! Oh my God! I thought she was on Atkins.
Amy  She was. Carbs found her... See, this is what I wanted. Two sisters, talking 
  about real stuff.
Rachel  (embarrassed) Oh, I can give you that.
Amy  You can?
Rachel  Yeah. I just, I kept trying to make you a better person, but you're... 
  you're already a pretty perfect version of what you are.
Amy  (touched) Thank you. I've got to admit, Emma does look
cute.
Rachel  Did you just say Emma?
Amy  Ugh, I'm sorry... Ella.
[Scene  Mike and Phoebe at a restaurant.]
Phoebe  That woman at the game didn't know what she was talking 
  about. Mike, obviously you have balls.
Mike  But please, let's just forget the whole thing.
Phoebe  (the waiter puts a piece of cake on the table) I would love it. Consider 
  it forgotten... But just so you know... however and whenever you decide to propose, 
  I promise I'll say yes. Whether... whether, you know, it is in a basketball 
  game, or in sky writing, or you know, like some lame guy in a cheesy movie who 
  hides it in the cake.
Phoebe  It's in the cake, isn't it?
Mike  (puts on a fake smile) Where else would lame Mr. No Balls hide it? (he 
  takes the ring from the cake, and cleans it with a napkin)
Phoebe  What's the matter with me? How do I keep ruining this? I'm sorry, I'm 
  sorry!
Mike  No! It's my fault. I keep trying to propose in these stupid ways and 
  all I wanna do is tell you that I love you and I want to spend the rest of my 
  life with you.
Mike  I'm gonna do this now.
Phoebe  Oh my God!
Mike  Phoebe, I...
Phoebe  Wait! Oh wait! (she takes off a ring that was already on her left ring 
  finger. After that Mike starts to kneel again, but then...) Oh no! (She was 
  wearing rings on all her fingers and her thumb, and takes all of these off.)
Mike  Ready?
Phoebe  Uh-huh! (and now Mike kneels properly)
Mike  Phoebe, I love you. There's no-one else in the world I would ask to marry 
  me... three times. But I wanna take care of you, have babies with you, and grow 
  old with you... Phoebe Buffay, will you marry me?
Phoebe  Yes!
Mike  I love you!
Phoebe  I love you more!
Mike  Not possible! (they kiss, and then Mike says proudly...) She's gonna 
  be Mrs. No Balls.
[Scene  The street in front of Central Perk. Rachel and Amy are 
  walking on the sidewalk.]
Rachel  So how is the uhm... baby styling business going?
Amy  Not that great. It's almost if people don't want to hear that their babies 
  are ugly.
Rachel  That's shocking!
Amy  Oh! It's Ross... Hey Ross! (She says hey to the guy at the falafel stand, 
  whose only similarity with Ross would be his black hair.) Hello-oo Ross! (to 
  Rachel) He's rude!
[Scene  Central Perk, everyone except Phoebe is there]
Phoebe  (she enters) Hey...
All  Hey!
Rachel  Hi!
Ross  Pheebs, what's wrong?
Phoebe  Oh, I'm just so exhausted from dragging around this...
   (she shows her ring) HUGE engagement ring!
All  OH!
Rachel  My God!
Ross  So, did he get on one knee, did he have a speech prepared, 
  or (in a tender way) did he cry? (the guys look at him) Yeah, big surprise, 
  I like proposals!
Phoebe  Well, it was really sweet, and like the
  most romantic thing ever.
Joey  Well, hey! Well... (he takes his mug to toast Phoebe) 
  Here's to Phoebe, who's found the greatest guy in the world! To Phoebe and... 
  (a bit uncertain) I wanna say Mike? (pause) To Phoebe and Mike!
All  Whoo!
Phoebe  Thank you! (to Rachel) Oh, and I have something for 
  you!
Rachel  Mmh-mmh!
Phoebe  It's, yes, my little black book. It's got the numbers 
  of all the guys I've dated.
Rachel  Oh, Pheebs, baby, that's nice but, you know what, 
  I think I'm ok. Why don't you give it to one of your other single girlfriends?
Phoebe  I would, but you're the last one.
Rachel  (angrily) GIVE ME THE BOOK! (she takes it and start 
  reading) Pablo Diaz, Brady Smith, huh, "Guy-in-van"?
Phoebe  Oh, my first love!
Rachel  Oh!
Monica  What does the red X next to Bob Greenmore's name mean?
Phoebe  Dead. (everyone is a bit upset) Oh, it's OK, no,
  he  was old, yeah! And he lived a full life, he was in the first wave
  at Omaha Beach.
Chandler  Hey, I'm sorry, I should have given you guys my 
  black book when I got married! Although it wasn't so much a book as a... napkin. 
  With Janice's phone number on it.
Rachel  Phoebe, isn't Jethro Tull a band?
Phoebe  (proud of herself) Oh yes, they are.
[Scene  Chandler and Monica's apartment]
Chandler  (he enters) Hey honey!
Joey  (Looking inside the fridge, and we only see his back. 
  Then he closes the door, and we see it's Joey.) Hi sweetie!
Chandler  Is Monica not here?
Joey  No.
Chandler  Oh, then I'll tell you. My agency was bidding for
  a big account and they got it! It's my first national commercial!
Joey  Cool!
Chandler  Yeah, and I don't wanna brag but a lot of the ideas
   were mine! (silence) Hell, you weren't there? All the ideas were
  mine!!!
Joey  That's great! Hey, can you cast me in it?
Chandler  Oh... I don't know, I really don't think you're 
  right for the part.
Joey  What do you mean? I can do anything, I'm a chameleon! 
  Huh? (he mimes an old man with a beard) I'm old! (then he yawns) I'm tired! 
  (then he mimes someone who's hot...) Hey, I'm hot (...and cold) I'm cold!! Huh?? 
  Come on! What can't I do?
Chandler  First of all. Bravo. Uh, but I really don't think 
  you're right for this. The part calls for a stuffy college professor.
Joey  I can do that! (in a deeper voice) "Hello, I'm 
  your professor. When I'm not busy thinking of important things or... professing. 
  I like to use..." Oh, what's the product?
Chandler  Software that facilitates inter-business networking 
  e-solutions?
Joey  (after a long pause he starts miming again) I'm cold!
[Scene  Central Perk. Charlie is sitting on the couch and Ross 
  enters.]
Ross  (to Charlie) Hey!
Charlie  Hey!
Ross  Guess who's a finalist for a huge research
  grant!  I'll give you a hint, he's looking right at you.
Charlie  Ah, well, unless it's the creepy guy with his hand 
  up his kilt, I'm gonna say congratulations!
Ross  Oh, I'm so excited, I mean, apparently I beat out hundreds
   of other applicants, included five guys I went to graduate school with. Not
  
  that I'm keeping score or anything... five!
Charlie  Wow, that's great! So, tell me about the grant!
Ross  Well, ok, it's for 25 thousand dollars. And if I get
   it, I'll finally be able to complete my field research! And there
   will be  an article about me in the "Paleontology Review"! Yeah!
   That'll be  the first time my name is in there, without people raising serious
   questions 
  about my work!
Charlie  Wait. Are you talking about the Dewar grant?
Ross  Yeah. Why?
Charlie  Benjamin Hobart is administering that grant.
Ross  Your ex-boyfriend?
Charlie  Yeah.
Ross  So, your ex-boyfriend is gonna determine if your new 
  boyfriend gets this grant? Wow, your new boyfriend is screwed!
Charlie  No, no, we ended up in great terms. I mean, if anything, 
  I think this could help you. You know what? Why don't we all go out to dinner 
  together, and I can introduce you.
Ross  Well, if you think it would help.
Charlie  Yes, absolutely. I'll call him.
Ross  Ok, now, is there anything I can do to... you know, 
  butter him up? Anything he really likes?
Charlie  Mmh... he does have a pretty serious latex fetish.
Ross  We'll see how dinner goes.
[Scene  Phoebe's apartment. She is packing a few tings into boxes.]
Monica  Hey, you wanna go to see a movie?
Phoebe  Well, I told you I had to spend all the day clearing 
  out stuff, so Mike could move in.
Monica  Oh, right.
Phoebe  Yeah.
Monica  Oh, well. Now that I'm here I might as well help you 
  with the cleaning and organizing! Just happen to have my label maker!
Phoebe  Oh, it's so hard to get rid of stuff! Did
  you and Chandler have to make compromises when you first moved in together?
Monica  Who's Gladys? (Phoebe shows her a horrific painting 
  with a half-a-body girl dummy coming out of the frame. Monica's frightened and 
  she gasps.) Oh! What a tragic loss!
Phoebe  Yeah. I really hate to give her up. Oh,
  I know!! Oh, you should take her!
Monica  (faking happiness) Well, I-I-I-I... I don't know...
Phoebe  Why, you don't like her?
Monica  Well, of course I do. What's not to like! I'll 
  take her in a minute! But, you know, I think that you're giving up too 
  easy, honey. I think that you need to fight for her!
Phoebe  Really? You think?
Monica  Absolutely! Yes, you say to him "I'm sorry 
  Mike I can't live without her, she means too much to me!"
Phoebe  Ok, I'll fight for her. Ok! Oh, wait, oh I just 
  realized... if I do that, that means you don't get her.
Monica  Damn it, I did not think this through!
[Scene  Central Perk. Rachel, Joey and Emma are there.]
Rachel  Hi!
Joey  Oh! Any word on casting yet?
Chandler  Joe, I told you, you're just not right for 
  the part.
Joey  What do you mean? Rach, don't I seem like a professor 
  you'd buy some kind of e-crap from?
Rachel  I'm sorry, this sounds like something I'm never gonna 
  be interested in.
Joey (to Chandler)  Look, c'mon, please? It's 
  not like I'm asking for some crazy favour. This is what I do for a living. I 
  am a professional actor! (he glances at his watch and sees the time) Oh, man, 
  I'm two hours late for work! (he stands, ready to go). Look, here's a 
  copy of my reels. It's got all the commercials that I've been in.
Chandler  Joe...
Joey  Just watch it, and if you don't like it, you don't 
  pass it on to your bosses!
Chandler  Fine!
Joey  Thank you. (he sits down)
Chandler  Work, Joe!
Joey  Damn it! (he leaves)
Chandler (to Rachel)  What am I gonna do now?
Joey  Just pass it to your boss!
Chandler  He's not right for the part. So if I suggest 
  him, my bosses are gonna think I'm an idiot! And that's something they should 
  learn on their own!
Rachel  Just tell Joey that you watched the tape and you liked 
  it, but your bosses didn't. Then that way, you're the good guy and 
  they're the bad guys.
Chandler  That's good! I liked it, they didn't. 
  (he sees Joey out of the window hitting on a girl) Joey, for God's sake, 
  go to work! (Joey runs away).
[Scene  A restaurant. Ross and Charlie are waiting for her ex-boyfriend, 
  Benjamin Hobart]
Ross  I can't believe I'm about to meet Benjamin Hobart. 
  I've always thought of him as one of the people I'd invite to my fantasy dinner 
  party. Do you think there's any chance he'll bring Christie Brinkley 
  or C3PO?
Charlie  (glances over Ross' shoulder) Sorry, looks 
  like it's just him.
Benjamin  Charlie! My God, you look absolutely stunning!
Ross  Well, I... I am having a good hair day.
Benjamin  So good to see you.
Charlie  Me too. (she and Benjamin are hugging for very long 
  and Ross starts pretending to clear his throat, until they stop)
Ross  I'm ok.
Charlie  I'm sorry... (introduces them to each other) Ross 
  Geller... Benjamin Hobart.
Ross  It's an honor to meet you. I can't tell 
  you how long I've been an admirer of your work, I mean, that Nobel prize, 
  (he thumbs up) whoooo! I mean, I have to tell you that, you're one of 
  the reasons I got into the field.
Benjamin  Oh, well, likewise. Actually, not likewise. I've 
  never heard of you until this morning, but, it's nice to be nice!
Charlie  Shall we? (they sit down and Benjamin takes Ross' 
  chair).
Benjamin  (to Ross) Thank you! (to Charlie). I can't
   believe that you chose this restaurant! Do you remember the night?
Charlie  Oh my God, I completely forgot! (they laugh) Oh
  my  God! I can't believe they let us back in this place! (they laugh
  more, and Ross start laughing too).
Benjamin (to Ross)  You weren't there!
Ross  No, but, it's, you know, it's just a funny image, 
  you know, the two of you, in this restaurant, with... (laughs nervously)tzz-zzz, 
  mmm.
Charlie  Ross, why don't you tell Benji about your proposal, 
  while I go to the ladies room?
Benjamin  So, tell me about it.
Ross  Ok well, I would like to do a dig in the painted desert.
Benjamin  M-m.
Ross  See, there are still several areas that haven't 
  been fully excavated.
Benjamin  Break up with Charlie!
Ross  What?
Benjamin  What?
Ross  Did you just say "break up with Charlie"?
Benjamin  Well, yes, and now. Yes I did say it, and no, I 
  didn't not say it.
Ross  Kind of inappropriate, don't you think?
Benjamin  I'm sorry. I just haven't seen her for so 
  long! All these feelings are rushing back! I'm starting to realize how much 
  I missed her, and I'm gonna need you to break up with her.
Ross  Are you serious?
Benjamin  If you say yes then I'm serious, if you say no then 
  I'm joking!
Ross  No!
Benjamin  Joking it is!
[Scene  Monica's apartment. Phoebe enters the room.]
Phoebe  Hi! Sorry, I'm late.
Monica  Hey, how did it go with Mike, is he gonna let you 
  keep the painting?
Phoebe  No, he really hates it. But he's gonna let me 
  keep my box of human hair! So you got to pick your battles. But the good news 
  is, Gladys is yours!
Monica  Wow, what's the bad news!
Rachel  Who's Gladys?
Phoebe  Oh, she's that work of art I made, you know, 
  with the woman coming out of the frame.
Rachel  (sarcastic) Oh, and Monica gets to keep her?
  In her house? I am so jealous!
Phoebe  Oh, I didn't know you wanted her too!
Monica  Huh!
Rachel  Well, I mean, sure, of course. But... you already 
  gave that to Monica, so...
Monica  You know, I would give her up, for you.
Rachel  No, I couldn't let you do that.
Monica  But I want to.
Rachel  But I don't want you to.
Monica  But I insist!
Rachel  But I insist harder!
Phoebe  Girls, girls, stop, ok? We'll flip a coin. Heads, 
  she's Rachel's, tails she's Monica's. (she flips the 
  coin). Tails! Monica, she's yours!
Monica  No, that landed in your food!
Rachel  (sarcastic) No, no, that's ok. You won fair
   and square. I'm so sad!
[Scene  Chandler walks into Joey's apartment]
Chandler  Hey Joe!
Joey  What's up?
Chandler  Bad news. I watched the tape and passed it along 
  to my bosses and they weren't interested.
Joey  (sounds disappointed) Oh.
Chandler  (Hands the tape back to him) I'm sorry man.
Joey  (looks at him suspiciously) But, ehm... you watched 
  the tape?
Chandler  (sounds nervous) Yeah! I... I... I liked it! (Joey 
  continues to look at him suspiciously) But, ehm... my bosses didn't go for it. 
  Stupid sons of bitches!
Joey  (sounds confident) You didn't watch the tape.
Chandler  (looks surprised) What!? Of course I did!
Joey  Look, it's one thing not to cast me, but to lie to me?
Chandler  I'm not lying to you, I watched it!
Joey  Well, you lied again! (Rachel comes out of her room 
  and is observing the conversation)
Chandler  I watched it!
Joey  Keep going Pinocchio!
Chandler  (now yelling) (pretending to look shocked) I did!
Joey  (yelling back) No you didn't! (turns and goes towards 
  his room)
Chandler  (following him) I'm telling you, I watched the tape. 
  (Reaches Joey's room and Joey slams the door in his face)
Rachel  Did you watch the tape?
Chandler (In a sarcastic "of course not"!-tone) 
  No!
[Scene  Interview room. Ross and two other professors (one man, 
  one woman) are sitting on one side of a long desk. Benjamin Hobart is sitting 
  on the other side]
Benjamin  The selection committee has chosen the three of 
  you as our finalists today. The ultimate decision will be based upon the answers 
  you give to the questions I ask here. I'm gonna start with Dr. Li. Dr. Li, you 
  claim the field is too reliant on the Linnaean taxonomic system. How do you 
  propose to correct this problem?
Dr. Li  Well, I believe that the answers lie in the osteological 
  evidence. I plan to begin there.
Benjamin  (nods) Interesting.
Ross  (Rolls his eyes) I guess!
Benjamin  Dr. Biely, your proposal includes some field work. 
  Where might that take place?
Dr. Biely  Primarily in the Pierre Shale region of South Dakota.
Benjamin  Certainly. Very well. And Dr. Geller, when is my 
  birthday?
Ross  (shocked and confused by the question) What? I... I... 
  (Benjamin looks at him as if to say "What's wrong? Answer the question")
Benjamin  Care to venture a guess?
Ross  (annoyed) May 12th?
Benjamin  (looks surprised and un-impressed) That's not even 
  kinda close! (Ross looks around confused) Dr. Li, how many graduate students 
  you'd be needing?
Dr. Li  Half a dozen.
Benjamin  I see, and Dr. Biely?
Dr. Biely  Three for excavation and two for analysis.
Benjamin  Certainly. Dr. Geller, which 1965 Shirelles hit 
  was later covered by a popular British invasion band?
Ross  (even more shocked) Wha..? I need 6 graduate students.
Benjamin  No! I'm sorry, we were looking for "Baby It's 
  You". Baby It's You.
Ross  Wha...? Wait, wait, wait, just a minute. None of my 
  questions have anything to do with Paleontology.
Benjamin  You're right, I apologize. Scratch the last question. 
  Spell "Boscodictiasaur".
Ross  (annoyed) um... I've never heard of a "Boscodictiasaur".
Benjamin  Yeah, I just made it up. Spell it.
Ross  (stares at him angrily) Ok. (determined to spell it 
  correctly) B - O - S ...
Benjamin  No, it starts with a silent "M".
Ross  Oh come on!!
[Scene  Joey and Rachel's apartment. Chandler and Rachel are 
  talking.]
Chandler  I can't believe Joey. I hate being called a liar!
Rachel  But you are a liar.
Chandler  What did I just say?
Joey  You still here?
Chandler  Yes, and I have to say, I am not just hurt. I am 
  insulted. When I tell somebody I did something...
Joey  Ok whoah-hey... Let me just stop you right there, ok? 
  First, you lied, right? Then, you lied about lying, ok? Then you lied about 
  lying about lying, ok? So before you lie about lying about lying about lying 
  about... lying... (loses count and begins to count the number of 'lyings' in 
  the air but gives up.) (yelling) Stop lying!
Chandler  Why are you so sure I didn't watch this tape?
Joey  (very angry) You wanna know wh...? You wanna know why? 
  (goes back into his room)
Rachel  Well, this is going well. (Chandler looks worried)
Joey  (comes out holding the tape) Here's how I know you didn't 
  watch the tape, ok? (puts it into the vcr) If you had seen what was on this 
  tape, believe me, you would have some comments. Alright, now remember, I 
  got paid a lot of money for this and it only aired in Japan. (presses play 
  and he appears on the TV screen and a TV commercial begins)
(The commercial 
Joey  (Yelling at Chandler) And that's how I know you 
  didn't watch the tape! (goes back to his room and slams the door).
Chandler  He really is a chameleon.
[Scene  Monica's apartment. Phoebe enters carrying the horrific 
  'painting' of Gladys. Monica and Rachel are sitting on the couch.]
Phoebe  (smiling from ear to ear) Well, Gladys say hello to 
  your new home! (she holds out the 'painting')
Monica  (faking happiness) Oh, my!
Rachel  (surprised by how ugly it is) Wow! (sarcastic) Oh, 
  she's so nice and big! Oh, Monica, where are you going to display Gladys oh 
  so proudly? (looks around for a spot)
Monica  (sounds desperate, knowing what Rachel is trying to 
  do) I haven't really settled on a spot yet!
Rachel  Well, hey! How about right above the TV? (Points to 
  the spot where her famous French poster is hanging). That way, it will be 
  the first thing that you see when you walk in the door!
Phoebe  (genuinely excited about it) Yeah, yeah! And you can 
  get rid of that French poster.
Monica  (offended) I like that poster!
Phoebe  Really? It doesn't have anything coming out of it. 
  Or maybe there is some place for her in your bedroom?
Rachel  (jumps at the chance to make that happen) Oh! There's 
  nothing above your bed!!
Monica  (Impatient with Rachel) Are you still here?
[Scene  Ross' office. Ross is pacing and Benjamin enters]
Ross  Oh hi! Hello! Uh, have you come to ask me some more paleontology 
  related questions? Uhm... your grandmother's nickname, perhaps? (Now yelling) 
  Aunt Margaret's pants size?
Benjamin  I've come here to apologize. I think I may have 
  let my feelings for Charlie interfere with the interview process.
Ross  (Sarcastic) No! Stop!
Benjamin  Anyway, I've decided to offer you the grant.
Ross  (Skeptical) Really?
Benjamin  Well... there is just one small... stipulation...
Ross  I have to break up with Charlie?
Benjamin  Hey, you got one right!
Ross  You're crazy.
Benjamin  Crazy, or... romantic?
Ross  Crazy!
Benjamin  Ooor...
Ross  (Yelling) Get out! (Benjamin leaves)
[Scene  Joey and Rachel's apartment.]
Rachel  O-oh my God!
Joey  (enters from his bedroom) What?
Rachel  Joey, what... is... this...thing... doing here?
Joey  I got it from Monica. She sold it to me for a very 
  reasonable price.
Rachel  Joey, we're not keeping this!
Joey  But it's an original Buffay...
Rachel  Alright, fine. You can keep it. As long as you don't 
  mind that she's haunted.
Joey  Hey? what? what? wey! whoo! what? what!?
Rachel  Well, legend has it Joey, that... she comes alive 
  when you're asleep.
Rachel  She climbs out of the frame, and then drags her half-a-body 
  across the floor, just looking for legs to steal. (in a spooky, slow voice) 
  And then with her one good hand, she slo-o-owly re-e-a-aches up and turns your 
  doorknob.
Joey  GET THAT LEGLESS WITCH OUT OF HERE!
Monica  Hey! I sold that to Joey.
Rachel  Well, why I told him it's haunted. Two can play at 
  this game. (gives Gladys to Monica)
Monica  No, too late. You can't give it back! (she pushes 
  the painting back to Rachel)
Rachel  Yes I can! (pushes her back again)
Monica  No you can't. She's yours!
Rachel  She's yours!
Monica  SHE'S YOURS!
Rachel  She's yours!
Phoebe  Hey! (there's a pause)
Rachel  She's mine!
Monica  She's m-i-i-ne!
Rachel  She's mine!
Monica  She's mine!
Phoebe  You guys! You guys! You don't have to fight over her 
  anymore. (she goes out into the hallway and enters with an even more hideous 
  painting/collage. One of those faceles mannequins heads wearing a blueish dress 
  and orange gloves reaching out into the room. Around the head 3 small dolls 
  are hovering.) Whoever doesn't get Gladys gets Glynnis. (Rachel and Monica are 
  gasping for air at the sight of this monstrous piece of art.)
Rachel  I want Gladys!
Monica  She's mine!
Rachel  She's mine!
Monica  She's mine!
Rachel  She's mine!
[Scene  Rachel and Joey's. Joey's home alone, reading a Sports 
  Illustrated magazine when Chandler enters.]
Chandler  Look, I'm sorry I didn't give them your tape. And 
  I promise, next time to submit you whether I think you are right for the part 
  or not.
Joey  That's not the point Chandler. The point is that you 
  lied.
Chandler  I know. You're right. What's it gonna take for you 
  to forgive me?
[Scene  Central Perk. Monica, Phoebe and Rachel are on the couch.]
Monica  Oh my God!
Rachel  Excellent!
Joey  Now, what do you say?
Chandler  Lying is wrong!
Joey  And?... AND?
Chandler  I'm a pretty little girl.
Phoebe  I knew it!
[Scene  Central Perk. Some time later that day. The group has 
  left and Charlie is there when Ross enters.]
Ross  Your ex-boyfriend is insane.
Charlie  Did you get the grant?
Ross  No I didn't, and you want to know why? Because your 
  ex-boyfriend is still in love with you.
Charlie  What?
Ross  Yeah. He wouldn't give me the grant, because I wouldn't 
  give you up.
Charlie  Benji isn't in love with me. I mean, he broke up 
  with me. And besides, he's a very ethical man.
Ross  Really? Is it ethical to ask someone in a grant review, 
  who was the voice of "Underdog"?
Charlie  I'm sure he was just joking, Ross.
Ross  If you don't believe me, let's go talk to him, okay? 
  I'm telling you, he didn't ask me one paleontological question.
Charlie  Seriously?
Ross  Oh, I'm sorry, no. He did ask me one. Uhm... How do 
  you spell Mboscodictiosaur?
Charlie  Well, if it's like the lake Mbosco in Congo, then 
  M-B-O...
Ross  Damnit!
[Scene  Benjamin's office. Ross and Charlie are entering.]
Benjamin  Dr. Geller...? Charlie... What are you... what are 
  you doing here?
Ross  I want you to tell her everything. About the deal you 
  tried to make with me, about the crazy questions you... Wally Cox! That's the 
  voice of Underdog!
Benjamin  Like I tried to tell you in the interview Ross, 
  this grant is not based on your knowledge of pretty useless trivia.
Ross  No, no, no. Don't do that! I want you to look her in 
  the eyes, and tell her the truth.
Charlie  Benji?
Benjamin  Alright, it's true. I behaved horribly. But it's 
  only because I still love you. And I would do anything to have you back in 
  my life.
Ross  Too little, too late, Benji!
Charlie  I can't believe this.
Benjamin  I never should have broken up with you. I think 
  about you all the time. I mean, do you ever still think about me?
Ross  (indignant) No!
Charlie  Yes!
Ross  What?
Charlie  I don't know what to say, Benji. This is all so.... 
  romantic.
Ross  or...
Benjamin  Listen, I know, I may be way out of bounds here, 
  but is there any chance you will take me back?
Charlie  Maybe...
Ross  Sweetie, this conversation is starting to make me a 
  little uncomfortable.
Charlie  Oh God! I am so sorry, but... (she puts her hand 
  on Ross's cheek) I mean it's... there's so much history between us, you know...
Benjamin  (puts his hand on Ross's other cheek) I'm sorry 
  too...
Benjamin  I love you!
Charlie  I love you too! (and they start to kiss)
Ross  Okay, that's it. WE ARE SEEING OTHER PEOPLE!
[Scene  Joey's bedroom. Joey's asleep with Hugsy, the penguin 
  right next to him.]
Joey  Gladys?
Rachel  Ha ha ha, third time this week. Man, this does not 
  get old.
Joey  You're mean!
Rachel  Oh, don't be such a baby!
[Scene  Central Perk]
Ross  Hey you guys!
Phoebe  Hey!
Ross  Hey, what are you doing?
Mike  Oh, figuring out our wedding plans.
Chandler  That's funny, we were doing the same thing!
Ross  Yeah!
Phoebe  It's really crazy! The hall, the dress, the food... I-I had no idea 
  how expensive this stuff was!
Chandler  Yeah it is really pricey. I mean, I freaked when I first heard the 
  numbers.
Phoebe  So what did you two do about it?
Chandler  It was pretty simple actually, I came up with a couple of cost-cutting 
  solutions, wrote out a list and Monica told me to go to hell.
Ross  There's no way around it Pheebs, you just gonna have to accept the fact 
  that this is gonna cost you a lot of money.
Mike  I heard that weddings are like a 40 billion dollar a year industry.
Ross  Yeah, and I'm responsible for just like half of that.
Phoebe  But really, it does seem like this money could be put to better use?
Mike  Are you serious?
Phoebe  Yeah! Now, how would you feel if we gave all the wedding money to charity 
  and we just got married at City Hall?
Mike  I think it would make me wanna marry you even more. (he kisses her)
Ross  I've got to say you guys, that's an incredible gesture!
Chandler  (to Ross) Maybe you do that next time you get married!
Ross  No, no, no. The next time it's gonna be a Hawaii at sunset. [pause] But 
  maybe the time after that!
[Scene  Monica and Chandler's apartment]
Joey  Hey!
Chandler  Hey!
Joey  What's going on?
Chandler  Our adoption social worker is coming by today so we are cleaning 
  the apartment.
Monica  (sarcastically) We?
Chandler  You know you don't want me to help. You can't have it both ways!
Joey  Hey, is this person who decides whether or not you... get a baby?
Chandler  Kind of. She's coming by to interview us and see where we live.
Monica  And it has to go perfectly, because if she doesn't like something about 
  us she can keep us off every adoption list in the state.
Joey  Hey, maybe I should stop by! She could be a soap opera fan! It's very 
  impressive when the little people know a celebrity.
Chandler  (pointing at himself) Little people?
Joey  (pointing at himself) Celebrity.
Monica  Ok, so I think I'm just about done here, unless you have any bad stuff 
  hidden somewhere, like... porn or cigarettes?
Chandler  What...? NO!
Monica  Chandler?
Chandler  (he stands up and he feels very offended) I don't, and I'm offended 
  by the insinuation!
Monica  Ok, so there's not a magazine under the couch, or a pack of cigarettes 
  taped to the back of the toilet tank, or a filthy video in the VCR?
Chandler  I'll admit to the cigarettes and the magazine, but that tape is not 
  mine.
Monica  It isn't mine!
Joey  (going out with the VCR in his hand) Well, I guess we'll never know whose 
  it is!
[Scene  The New York City Children's fund hallway.]
Charity guy  May I help you?
Phoebe  Yes. We're here to make a rather sizeable donation to the children.
Charity guy  Well, any contribution, large or small, is always appreciated.
Phoebe  Well, I think you're gonna appreciate it the crap out of this one (she 
  gives him a check)
Charity guy  Well, this is very generous!
Phoebe  And we don't want any recognition. This is completely anonymous.
Mike  Completely anonymous. From two kind strangers.
Phoebe  Mr. X and Phoebe Buffay.
Charity guy  Well if you like, we can include your names in our newsletter.
Mike  Not necessary.
Phoebe  Buffay is spelled B-U-F-F-A-Y.
Mike  And "X" is spelled uhm... "Mike Hannigan".
Phoebe  Sure, I so glad we did this. It feels so good!
Mike  It does. It feels really good!
Phoebe  Oh, look! And we get these free t-shirts! (she takes a t-shirt which 
  was on the counter)
Charity guy  Oh, actually, that's the shirt I wore to the gym.
Phoebe  Mhm... it's moist.
[Scene  Joey and Rachel's apartment.]
Ross  (he enters) Hi!
Rachel  Hi! Emma will be up in a minute!
Ross  Oh, good!
Rachel  Oh hey Ross... Listen, I heard about you and Charlie. I'm really sorry.
Ross  Oh, that's OK. I'm sure there are tons of other beautiful paleontologists 
  out there.
Rachel  Absolutely.
Ross  There was one! She's it! All the rest look like they should live under 
  a bridge!
Rachel  So, uhm... what are you gonna do today?
Ross  Well, I was thinking of taking Emma to the playground!
Rachel  Oh my God, what!?
Ross  Like I said I was thinking of taking Emma to the museum of knives and 
  fire!
Rachel  Ok, look, Ross. I do not want Emma going to the playground.
Ross  Be-caaauuuse...
Rachel  (upset) All right, well, if you must know... I had a traumatic... swing 
  incident... when I was little.
Ross  Seriously?
Rachel  Yes, I was 4 years old and I was on the swing and then all of a sudden 
  my hair got tangled in the chain. And to get me out my mom had to-had to cut 
  a big chunk of my hair! (crying) And it was uneven for weeks!
Ross  (sarcastic) And you made it through that? I wonder who's gonna play you 
  in the movie!
Rachel  Ok, fine! You can make fun of me. I do not want Emma going there. And 
  I was thinking Claire Danes.
Ross  Look, I'm sorry to hear about your tragedy, ok? But the swings are perfectly 
  safe, and besides Emma loves them. You know what, you should come with us and 
  you'll see!
Rachel  Ross, those things go like 40 miles an hour! Ok? When you're... and 
  there is that moment when you are at the top, when you just don't know if you're 
  gonna return back to earth!
Ross  Space is filled with orbiting children. (pause) Look, please, just come 
  on, you know, when you’ll see the look on Emma’s face, I swear you 
  won’t regret it.
Rachel  All right!
Ross  Good, you don’t want to be one of those mothers who pass on their 
  irrational fears on their children, do you?
Rachel  Irrational, huh? All right, well, I’ll remember that the next 
  time you freak out about a spider in your apartment!
Ross  Oh, yeah, that’s the same, I am sure there are thirty different 
  species of poisonous swings!
[Scene  Monica’s apartment. Somebody knocks the door]
Chandler  Ok, ok, here we go.
Monica  Ok.
Chandler  Here we go. Stand up straight. (smiling) Big smile. (opens the door 
  and both are smiling exaggeratedly)
Phoebe  Hello, is this the creepy residence?
Monica  We’re waiting for the adoption lady, but, hey, I’m glad 
  you’re here. I was cleaning this morning and I found this (she puts a 
  box on the table and opens it). I don’t know if you wanna use it, but…
Phoebe  Awe, this is so sweet of you! But you know what? I won’t be needing 
  a veil, I actually won’t be wearing a dress at all!
Monica  I told you! I am not coming to a naked wedding!
Phoebe  No, no, no, we’re not having a big reception, we took the money 
  we were gonna spend on a wedding and we donate them to the children charity.
Monica  That’s crazy! (Phoebe looks bewildered). I am sorry. I just can’t 
  imagine giving up my one wedding day like that!
Phoebe  We, you know, we’re different! We don’t care about having 
  a huge party. (She picks up the veil) This is really nice for you, but, oh, 
  please, I put this on? (she puts it on) And, ow, I look (she looks her reflex 
  image on a toaster), why, well, radiant. (pause) All right, well, who cares, 
  I don’t need a pretty veil and a fancy dress.
Monica  That’s right. You’re making a commitment and that’s 
  the same, whether you do that at the Plaza or, where are you gonna do it?
Phoebe  City Hall.
Monica  Ow! (Chandler slaps her on her back) Oh, that sounds nice! I am just 
  there for jury duty. They really spruce that place up!
Phoebe  It’s ok, it’s ok. I made my decision. What I really want 
  is a great big wedding (she covers her mouth)
Monica  Yay!
Chandler  But you already gave all your money to charity!
Phoebe  Well, I’ll just ask for it back!
Chandler  I don’t think you can do that!
Monica  Why not! This is her wedding day, this is way more important than some 
  stupid kids!
Chandler  That’s sweet, honey, but save something for the adoption Lady.
[Scene  The playground. Ross put Emma on the swing and they’re 
  ready to play]
Rachel  Ok, careful.
Ross  Ok.
Rachel  Careful, watch her hair. WATCH HER HAIR!
Ross  Rach, she’s got like three hairs!
Rachel  I know (she touches Emma’s head) but they’re just so beautiful! 
  Oh, my God, I just pulled one out.
Ross  I promise you she’s safe! No watch how much she loves this.
Rachel  Ok.
Ross (to Emma)  Ready sweety?
Rachel  Ok.
Ross  Here we go! (He starts pushing Emma)
Rachel  Ok, careful, ok. (Emma giggles) Oh, she’s smiling! Oh my God, 
  she does like it!
Ross  See, I told you!
Rachel  Awe! (Emma laughs) Oh my God! Looks, she’s a little dare-devil! 
  Oh, let me push, can I push?
Ross  Oh, absolutely!
Rachel  Ok. Oh God. (To Ross) Get the camera, it’s in the diaper bag.
Ross  Ok! (he takes the camera and walks backwards to take a shot) See? Scared 
  of swings, I bet you feel pretty silly (a swinging boy knocks him down) Ow!
[Scene  The New York City Children's fund ]
Mike  We’re seriously asking for our money back?
Phoebe  It’s for our wedding day! Right, now, is this guy gay or straight, 
  because one of us gonna have to start flirting.
Charity guy  Wow! Are you here to make another donation the same day? I don’t 
  think that that’s ever happened before.
Phoebe (to Mike)  Gay, go.
Mike (to the charity guy)  Oh my God, I love your shirt!
Phoebe  The donation we made earlier, we k…, we w…, we want it 
  back.
Charity guy  Excuse me?
Phoebe  Yeah. See, that money was for a big wedding, that we thought we didn’t 
  want, but it turns out we do.
Charity guy  So you’re asking us to refund your donation to the children?
Mike  Yeah! This feels really good.
Phoebe  I am sorry. I am, but this wedding is just really important to me.
Charity guy  Hey, it’s not my business, (he takes their check from a 
  drawer) besides it’s probably a good thing. We really would have been 
  spoiling the children, all those food, and warm clothing…
Phoebe  Hey, that’s not fair! A person’s wedding is important! 
  And especially to me! Ok? I didn’t have a graduation party! And I didn’t 
  go to Prom. And I spent my sweet sixteen being chased round a tire yard by an 
  escaped mental patient who is his own words wanted to “kill me” 
  or whatever. So I deserve a real celebration and I am not gonna let some sweaty 
  little man make me feel badly about it.( She storms out)
Mike  She could have been talking about either one of us.
[Scene  Monica’s apartment. Somebody knocks the door]
Laura  Hi, I am Laura, I am here for your adoption interview.
Monica  Hi, I am Monica and this is Chandler. Please come in.
Laura  Thank you!
Monica  Would you like something to drink?
Laura  Oh, water would be fine.
Monica  Ok. Great. I am so glad that you are here. We’re really excited 
  about getting this process started.
Chandler  Oh, because we love kids. Love ‘em to death.Well, not actually 
  to death, that's just a figure of speech - we love kids the appropriate amount... 
  as allowed by law.
Laura  Your place is just lovely.
Monica  Ah, thank you. This building does have a wholesome family feel to it.
Laura  You know, I... I feel like I've been here before. Are any other couples 
  in the 
  building adopting?
Monica  Is that that couple on the first floor? Because we should get a baby 
  before 
  them. Yeah! That guy tried to sell me drugs. (Laura looks shocked)
Chandler  But other than that... wholesome, wholesome building.
Laura  Oh...
Chandler  What?
Laura  I just realized why I remember this place.
Monica  Really? What is it?
Laura  Oh, it's nothing. I went on a date with a guy who lived in this building 
  and it 
  didn't end very well.
Monica  Ohh... that wouldn't by any chance be... Joey Tribbiani?
Laura  Yes!
Chandler  Of course it was!
Laura  Yeah, we had a really great night and in the morning he promised he 
  would call 
  me and he didn't.
Chandler  RAT BASTARD!
Laura  So you're not friends with him?
Monica and Chandler  OH GOD NO! Nope, no, no, no. No! No, no. Nope! No, no, 
  no, no, no, no, no, no, no. NO! (finally Monica concludes) No!
Laura  Well, I'm sorry I brought it up. So, are either one of you planning 
  on staying at 
  home with your child... (someone knocks on the door)
Joey  (form the other side of the door) Hellooo? Anybody in there order a celebrity? 
  
  (He starts to enter the apartment and Chandler runs to the door and shuts it 
  back in 
  his face) OW!
Laura  What was that?
Chandler  Oh, it's just some crazy guy who roams the halls here. He's great 
  with 
  kids though.
[Scene  Ross and Rachel are at the playground with Emma. Rachel 
  in putting her back in the stroller and Ross is tending to his wound]
Rachel  Oh, oh Ross, oh my God, are you okay?
Ross  SON OF A BITCH! (turns to his right to see three kids staring at him) 
  (To the 
  kids) Oh relax! I didn't say the 'F' word! (They go away)
Rachel  Ross, see! I told you, those swings are evil! Alright, that is it. 
  That is 
  the last time Emma is getting on one of those things for her entire life.
Ross  No! No, no, no, no, okay, it wasn't the swing's fault. It was my fault 
  and kind 
  of that (point to the kid that kicked him) kids fault. Who is still laughing. 
  Nice.
Rachel  Ross, c'mon, please. Can we just get out of here, before somebody else 
  gets 
  hurt?
Ross  No wait, okay, okay, I have an idea. I want you to get on the swing, 
  okay? And 
  you'll see that there's nothing to be afraid of.
Rachel  (looks at him suspiciously) I know what this is all about... You've 
  always been 
  jealous of my hair.
Ross  Look, I just think you're an adult, okay? And you should get over your 
  silly 
  fears.
Rachel  Alright fine. I'll do it.
Ross  Good.
Rachel  If you hold a spider.
Ross  (He freaks out and starts jumping around brushing his sweater) WHAT? 
  WHERE? WHERE?
Rachel  IF you hold a spider.
Ross  I know. (Rachel bends down to Emma and Ross looks over his shoulder again, 
  
  afraid)
[Scene  Chandler and Monica's apartment. Chandler is still leaning 
  against the door, keeping Joey out, who is still banging and shouting on the 
  other side.]
Joey  Guys? Everything ok? It's me, Joe...
Chandler  (Screams to interrupt Joey) AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA......AAAaaa-doption!!
Laura  What's going on?
Chandler  Oh, just like I said. That crazy... Bert... roaming the halls. (Joey 
  bangs on 
  the door again)
Joey  Guys!?
Monica  Keep on roaming Bert! We don't want any crazy today!
Joey  What's going on?
Chandler  WE'LL TALK TO YOU LATER, BERT. EVERYTHNG'S FINE!!
Joey  Everything doesn't sound fine!
Laura  Is he alright out there by himself?
Chandler  Oh yeah! He has a caretaker. His older brother... Ernie.
Laura  Bert and Ernie!
Chandler  (nervous smile) You can't make this stuff up!
[Scene  Central Perk. Phoebe and Mike enter]
Mike  You never told me about that guy on your sweet sixteen. Oh, ugh. I'm 
  sorry about 
  that.
Phoebe  (Lightly) Oh! It ended okay. One of my friends shot him.
Mike  Well, hey, at least you're getting a proper wedding. I mean, you really 
  deserve that.
Phoebe  Yeah, I really do. You know, I had nothing growing up. (thinks for 
  a few 
  seconds) Just like the kids I took the money from.
Mike  No! No, no. I see where this is going. Don't make me go back there.
Phoebe  Look, I can't have a wedding with this money now. It's tainted.
Mike  Alright, fine. We'll give the money back.
Phoebe  And if that guy at the charity gives us a hard time, my friend hasn't 
  shot 
  anyone in a really long time.
[Scene  Monica and Chandler's. They are preparing 
  to show Laura around. Laura is standing with her back to the window, Chandler 
  and Monica are standing on either side of her, facing each other.
Laura  Well, I must say, this seems like a lovely environment to raise a child 
  in.
Monica  Oh, by the way, you are more than welcome to look under any of the 
  furniture, 
  because, believe me, you won't find any porn or cigarettes under there!
Laura  Oh! Well, actually, before we look around, let me make sure I have everything 
  I need 
  up to here...
Monica  (Pulls Laura into the spare room) Why don't I show you the baby's room?
Chandler  What the hell are you doing?
Joey  Well, you wouldn't let me in, so I thought you were in trouble.
Chandler  Well, we're not.
Joey  But you called me 'Bert'!? That's our code word for danger!
Chandler  We don't have a code word.
Joey  We don't? We really should. From now on, 'Bert' will be our code word 
  for danger.
Monica  So that was the baby's room. (They come out and Chandler throws Joey 
  behind 
  the couch and puts his foot on him. Monica looks at Chandler)
Monica  (To Chandler) What room should we see next?
Chandler  Any room that isn't behind this couch! (laughs nervously)
Monica  (laughs nervously as well, Laura looks confused) (To Laura) Some people 
  don't 
  get him, but I think he's really funny! (She takes Laura to their own bedroom).
Joey  (quivering with anger) I did not care for that!
Chandler  (escorting Joey to the door) You have to get out of here. You slept 
  with 
  our social worker and you never called her back and she is still pissed, so 
  she can't 
  see you.
Joey  Ok, ok! (He leaves)
Chandler  Ok!
Chandler  What?
Joey  I forgot my bat.
Laura  Oh my God!
Chandler  And for the last time, we do not want to be friends with you! And 
  we don't want to buy your bat! (Joey lowers his bat)
Laura  What are you doing here?
Joey  (to Chandler) Bert! Bert! Bert! Bert!
Laura  Are you friends with him?
Chandler  I can explain... Joey...
Joey  Uhm... ok... uhm... Well, yeah... You have got some nerve, coming back 
  here. I can't believe you never called me.
Laura  Excuse me?
Joey  Oh... yeah... Probably you don't even remember my name. It's Joey, by 
  the way. And don't bother telling me yours, because I totally remember it... 
  lady. Yeah! I waited weeks for you to call me.
Laura  I gave you my number, you never called me.
Joey  No, no! Don't try to turn this around on me, ok? I'm not some kind of... 
  social work, ok, that you can just... do.
Laura  (embarrassed towards Chandler and Monica) Well, I'm pretty sure I gave 
  you my number.
Joey  Really? Think about it. Come on! You're a beautiful woman, smart, funny, 
  we had a really good time, huh? If I had your number, why wouldn't I call you?
Laura  I don't know... Well, maybe I'm wrong... I'm sorry...
Joey  No, no, hey, no! Too late for apologies... ok? You broke my heart. You 
  know how many women I had to sleep with to get over you? (and he leaves the 
  apartment, leaving her shocked)
Laura  Joey, wait!
Joey  (acting sad) NO! I waited a long time, I can't wait anymore... (and closes 
  the door behind him)
Laura  (laughing nervously) I'm sorry that you had to see that. I'm so embarrassed...
Chandler  Oh, that's really ok.
Monica  Yeah, that we totally understand. Dating is hard.
Laura  Boy, you people are nice... And I've got to say... I think you're going 
  to make excellent parents.
Joey  LAURA! (and points to her, very confident)
[Scene  The New York City Children's Fund building. Phoebe and 
  Mike are entering.]
Phoebe  (to the Charity guy) We're back!
Charity guy  Are you here to take more money? Because, I think what you're 
  looking for is an ATM.
Mike  No, no, we're here to give the money back.
Phoebe  Yeah, because you know what, it's... it's all about the children.
Phoebe  Although... it's also about the wedding... Ugh, alright... here. (she 
  gives the check and pulls it back again) No... Oh God... Oh!
Charity guy  If I haven't said so already sir, (sarcastically pointing to Phoebe) 
  congratulations!
Mike  (takes the check from Phoebe) Ok, look! Enough! Alright? I'm stepping 
  in. I'm putting my foot down! As your future husband I'm going to make this 
  decision for us. (thinking) Now... what do you think we should do?
Charity guy  You know what? It's not your decision anymore.
Mike  What?
Charity guy  On behalf of the Children of New York, I reject your money.
Phoebe  But... but... but we're giving you this!
Charity guy  Yeah... And I'm giving it back to you... Come on! Consider it 
  a contribution. (gives the check to Phoebe)
Phoebe  (looks at the amount on the check, and gasps) Well, this is very generous!
Charity guy  Please, take the check, go have a great wedding and a wonderful 
  life together.
Mike  Well, I mean... It sounds good to me. And that way we can save up, come 
  back in a few years and make an even bigger donation.
Charity guy  Absolutely! And when you do, make sure you ask for Brian.
Phoebe  Oh, is that you?
Charity guy  No!
[Scene  Chandler and Monica's apartment. They are sitting in 
  their living room when the phone rings.]
Monica  Hello...? Oh hi... Oh my God...! Really...? I can't wait to tell Chandler... 
  Ok, goodbye. (hangs up)
Chandler  Wrong number?
Monica  It was Laura... She gave us a great report and we are officially on 
  the waiting list.
Chandler  That's great!
Monica  Now we just have to wait for a call and... and someone tells us there's 
  a baby waiting for us. Oh...
Chandler  Hello...? Have you seen Joey's bat?
[Scene  The playground. Ross, Rachel and Emma are still there. 
  Rachel comes walking to Ross and Emma with something between her hands.]
Rachel  Ok... I got a spider. There were two, I picked the bigger one.
Ross  (nervously) Ok...
Rachel  Ok... (and passes the spider to Ross who holds it in between his hands)
Ross  (Gasps and speaks at a higher pitch) This feels perfectly normal. Ok, 
  get on the swing!
Rachel  (reluctantly) Ok... O-k...
Rachel  (more confident) Ok...
Rachel  whoo... ok... wow... ok... OH!
Ross  See?
Rachel  A-alright! I can do this.
Ross  There you go! Good for you! And you know what, I'm actually getting used 
  to this little guy. I don't really even feel him in here anymore.
Rachel  That's because he's on your neck.
Ross  Well... (realizes, screaming like a little girl, trying to get rid of 
  the spider) Whaa... aaah... aaahhh...
Rachel  ROSS!
[Scene  Central Perk. Monica and Chandler enter, the others are sitting on the couch.]
Monica  Hey guys!
Rachel  Hi!
Phoebe  Hey!
Monica  We need to talk to you about something.
Chandler  Yeah. We don't feel like we can host Thanksgiving this year.
All  What?
Phoebe  Hey!
Ross  Are you kidding?
Chandler  Well, it's just with uhm, work and the stress of adoption, we just don't feel like we have the energy. Plus, we don't think it's fair that every year the burden falls on us.
Ross  (skeptical) That doesn't sound like you... That's Monica talking!
Chandler  No, no! We made this decision together.
Ross  She's putting words in your mouth!
Joey  Don't you put words in people's mouths, you put turkey in people's mouths!
Rachel  I can't believe this! This is Emma's first Thanksgiving!
Monica  No, it's not!
Rachel  It's not? (whispering to Ross) When was she born?
Phoebe  Well, personally I think it's great you're giving yourself a break.
Monica  Thank you, Pheebs!
Phoebe  Sure. It's just as well... I mean, last year wasn't very good. I think she's losing her touch.
Monica  What? You are way off, lady!
Phoebe  Am I? Really? Am I? Well, why don't you cook Thanksgiving dinner and prove me wrong! Well, think about it, think about it, you'll be trying to top than you did last year. You'd be in competition... with yourself.
Monica  That's my favourite kind! Okay, we are doing this!
Chandler  Don't let yourself get manipulated this way!
Monica  Hey, stay out of this, Chandler! This is between me... and ME!
Chandler  We are supposed to make these decisions together! Did you not watch the Doctor Phil I taped for you?
[Scene  Joey and Rachel's apartment. Rachel and Monica are in there, and Phoebe enters]
Phoebe  Hey!
Rachel  Hi! Happy Thanksgiving!
Phoebe  Oh, yeah, happy needless-turkey-murder day.
Monica  You guys, I ordered some chocolate pies from that bakery on Bleecker. Could you pick them up for me?
Phoebe  You're not making the pies yourself?
Monica  No, no, no, I don't make chocolate pies. When I was younger I-I enter in this pie-eating contest. I ate so many that just the thought of them made me sick.
Rachel  Did you at least win the contest?
Monica  2 minutes, 12 pies and a part of one tin! Okay, I see you guys at 4.
Rachel  Can't wait!
Monica  This dinner is gonna be so great! In your face, last year "me"!
Phoebe  Hey Rach.
Rachel  Yeah.
Phoebe  What's Emma doing today?
Rachel  Well, let's see... uh... I know that she has a meeting with her lawyer and then she has to make a very big poop. Why?
Phoebe  Well, I wanna enter her in a baby beauty pageant.
Rachel  Oh my God! That's the creepiest thing I've ever heard!
Phoebe  Okay, but, well, before you say no, my friend Susanne is entering her kid and compared to Emma she's a real dog!
Rachel  Oh! Phoebe, all babies are beautiful!
Phoebe  (sarcastic) Oh... okay.
Rachel  Phoebe, just the idea of pitting one baby against another, I mean, you know, and judging who's cuter just for a trophy...
Rachel  And a thousand dollars.
Rachel  ...is something I'm very interested in! Oh please, do not tell Ross. He still believes that (in a deep voice, mocking Ross) what's in the inside is important...
Phoebe  Okay, oh, and Emma needs a cowgirl outfit for the competition.
Rachel  Where am I gonna get a cowgirl outfit on Thanksgiving?
Phoebe  Well, I was thinking...
Rachel  Oh, take the clothes of Joey's Cabbage Patch Kid.
Phoebe  Yeah!
[Scene  Monica and Chandler's apartment. Chandler is watching TV and Monica is cooking]
Monica  (Chandler's laughing) Did someone drop the baton again?
Chandler  Why come all the way from Kansas to do that?
Monica  (she tastes what she has cooked) I don't get older. I just get better!
Chandler  You know what just occurred to me? This could be our last Thanksgiving just the two of us. I mean, we could be getting a baby soon!
Monica  You don't know that.
Chandler  Somebody is gonna pick us.
Monica  Yeah, but we haven't heard a thing from the adoption agency and it has been weeks!
Chandler  I'm telling ya! It's gonna happen. Next year it's gonna be you, me and the little Hemingway Bing. (pause) What, he's my favourite author!
Monica  Name one of his books.
Chandler  (after a long pause) "The Firm"?
Monica  Ok, let's see... uhm, okay, the turkey is in the oven, the stuffing is ready...
Chandler  You know, you always cook this meal all by yourself. Let me help this year.
Monica  Oh, Chandler, that's sweet. But you don't have to do everything Doctor Phil tells you to do.
Chandler  I'm serious, let me do something, just not the turkey or the stuffing, nothing "high profile".
Monica  Ok, let's see... Oh, the cranberry sauce, it is easy to make and no-one really cares about it.
Chandler  Tell me more.
Monica  Okay, I'm gonna go check on something across the hall. You start by washing these (she gives Chandler a bowl with cranberries. Then, while she's going outside, she sees him with a bottle of soap in his hands) Not with soap!! (she leaves)
Chandler  You obviously haven't tasted my Palmolive potatoes!
Ross  Hey! Hey, guess what Joey has!
Joey  Three tickets to today's Rangers game!!
Ross  Dude, I wanted him to guess.
Joey  Oh.
Chandler  Oh my God!
Joey  Yeah, they're great seats too!
Ross  Guess where they are?
Joey  Center ice.
Ross  Did I do something to you?
Chandler  Hmm, the game's at one.
Ross  So?
Chandler  Dinner is at four, we'll never gonna make it back.
Joey  So we'll leave before it's over, we'll be back in time.
Chandler  You say that now, but it could take us a long time to get back home. Plus Joey could get lost and and they could have to page us to go pick him up.
Joey  Dude, two times that happened!
Chandler  Look, Monica has been working hard all day, she didn't wanna host this thing in the first place, we shouldn't go!
Ross  He's right, man.
Joey  Right, I guess. Alright, so see you at four.
Chandler  Okay. (pause) And get ready to taste my very special cranberries. Or should I say... chanberries!
Joey  That's some gentle comedy, dude. (he and Ross leave)
Ross  We're still going at the game, right?
Joey  Yeah!
Ross  Yeah.
[Scene  Baby beauty contest]
Host  This is contestant number sixteen, Rebecca...
Phoebe  Hey.
Rachel  Oh Phoebe, listen. Well, I think we gotta go. This place is really freaking me out. I've been watching this guy over there, I don't think he came with a kid!
Phoebe  We can't leave now! There was this one baby, Haley, who was favourite to win and she got croup, so she had to stay home! This competition just blew wide open, folks!
Rachel  Phoebe, I think... It's just too weird, I just saw a one year old running around with pantyhose on!
Phoebe  Oh, I know, we should have been more prepared. (she looks around) It's okay. Now, the way I see it, our real competition now is Cameron. Oh my God, they just took her sweater off. Look at those arms! Hello Michelin Man.
Rachel  Oh, Phoebe! Come on! You know what, it's already three o'clock and they haven't even gotten to Emma's group yet. We gotta go, we got dinner!
Phoebe  (panicking) But Emma's got what it takes, she could go all the way!
Rachel  Phoebe, you have to calm down.
Phoebe  Okay. Rachel, the hottest babies in the Tri-State Area are in this room right now! I overheard one of the judges say that not one of them holds a candle to Emma!
Rachel  Really?
Phoebe  Yeah!
Rachel  You heard them say that?
Phoebe  Yeah!
Rachel  All right, okay. Alright, let's give to these babies something to cry about!
Phoebe  Good! Oh yay! Let's get down to business! Emma needs some makeup!
Rachel  No, what?
Phoebe  Well, she's gonna look all washed out next to the other contestants!
Rachel  No Phoebe, I am not letting you put makeup on my baby!
Phoebe  Why not!
Rachel  Because I already did!
[Scene  Madison Square Garden]
Joey  Oh, Bob, get off the guy!
Ross  Oh! What a game, huh?
Joey  I know, yeah.
Ross  I can't believe Chandler is missing this!
Joey  Yeah. I am sorry he's not here too, but I got to say, (takes some nachos from a plate on the seat where Chandler should have been) I am really enjoying Nacho Chair.
Ross  Yeah, I'd probably enjoy it more if you didn't keep batting my hand away.
Joey  Ohhhh! These seats are great!
Ross  I know, I know! When I was here for Holidays on Ice (Joey looks around worried hoping no one heard that) I was sitting so far away Michelle Kwan couldn't read my banner!
Joey  (looks at the time) Wow, hey, we'd better get going. If we don't leave right now, we'll be late for dinner.
Ross  Oh, but it's a kind game! So we're a little late, you know, the girls will be there, let's stay just for one more goal.
Joey  I don't know...
Ross  One more fight!
Joey  Okay.
Ross  Okay.
[Scene  Chandler and Monica's apartment.]
Monica  Where is everybody? They're forty-five minutes late!
Chandler  I can't believe they are not here! I slave and I slave for what? They've ruined cranberry day!
[Scene  The corridor. Ross and Joey have just arrived.]
Joey  How late are we?
Ross  Forty-five minutes.
Joey  Wow (He opens his apartment door and throws their stuff in.)
Ross  (handing him his coat) Here!
Joey  Okay. Rachel and Phoebe are already there, okay? So they probably started without us. We could just slip in and no-one needs to know where we were! (he raises his hands and on his right one there's a Rangers foam finger)
Ross  You may want to lose the foam finger!
Joey  Oh, no, no, no, no, no. You just want to put it on your hand!
Ross  Hey!
Phoebe  Oh!
Joey  You are not at Thanksgiving?
Rachel  No...
Phoebe  No, we're late!
Rachel  What are you doing here!
Ross  We're late too! (Rachel screams)
Joey  We figured we could be late because you guys were gonna be on time (he points the foam finger at the girls)
Phoebe  Don't point that thing at me, Tribbiani!
Ross  So, nobody's here? Monica's gonna kill us!
Joey  Yeah, where were you!
Ross  Yeah, yeah, what's with the trophy!
Phoebe  Uh, we were at the Spelling Bee!
Rachel  And I won!
Ross  You won an adult Thanksgiving day spelling bee.
Rachel  Yes! (spells it) Y-E-S. Yes!
Ross  Let me see this... (he takes the trophy from Rachel's hands) Grand Supreme Little Darling, New York Division.
Rachel  Yeah. That's me!
Ross  You entered Emma into a Beauty Pageant?
Phoebe  And it looks like she put makeup on her!
Joey  Wait a second, wait a second, where have I seen that cowgirl outfit before...
Ross  I can't believe this, she's our daughter! That you would treat her like some kind of showdog is inexcusable!
Rachel  She won a thousand dollars!
Ross  So this is an annual thing?
Joey  (realizing) Oh! That's Alicia Mae Emory's outfit!
Phoebe  You guys, there are people in there who are not getting any happier!
Ross  Yeah. What are we gonna do?
Rachel  Well, I don't know, you guys figure it out, I got to put Emma down for a nap.
Joey  All right. Hey Rach, while you're in there, throw something on Alicia Mae.
Phoebe  Alright, what are we gonna say?
Ross  Ooh, we'll say that we were mugged! You can't get mad at someone who's been mugged!
Phoebe  Oh, good, that's good, but you don't look like you were mugged!
Joey  No. Here (he tears off the pocket from Ross' shirt, and tears off everything below that as well.)
Ross  (to Joey) HEY!
[Scene  Monica's apartment.]
Monica  Do you hear something? (Chandlers stands up and goes to the door to look out from the peephole)
Chandler  (peeping) They're out there!
Monica  Ohhh! Let me see! Oh God, I can't believe this! They're an hour late and they're just staying out there, talking!
Chandler  (peeping) Everything is so distorted! Looks like Joey has a giant hand! Which says "Rangers" on it. They went to the game!
Monica  (gasps) Oooh! They are in for a world of pain!
Chandler  (looking through the peephole again) Ross' shirt is torn.
Monica  Oh! They're late and they're sloppy!
Rachel  Alright, Emma is napping... (then to Ross) what happened to your shirt?
Ross  I got mugged. And they stole my pocket.
Ross  (sarcastic) That would be a good way to get rid of all the PCP we have lying around.
Rachel  You know what, we just say that she said it was 5 o'clock. We'll just act casual. We're not late, we're right on time. (When she finishes talking, a note is pushed from under Monica's and Chandler's door, into the hall. Ross picks it up and reads it out loud)
Ross  (Reading the note) We know you're out there. (Rachel gasps)
Joey  (whispering) Who do you think its from?
Rachel  Oh, God. This is bad. This is so bad.
Ross  Well, let's just go in there and face them.
Phoebe  Well, I'm not going in first. I bet that vein on Monica's forehead is popping like crazy.
Joey  I hate that thing, it's like a... bolt of lightning.
Rachel  Oh, hey, I have an idea. Why don't we play rock-paper-scissors, and whoever loses goes in first. (they all agree) Ready? (they do the rock-paper-scissor thing with they hands and Rachel has paper, Phoebe and Ross both have rock, while Joey is doing a strange upward wiggling with his fingers. They all look a him confused).
Joey  (smiling from ear to ear) Ah-haah! I win!!
Ross  What is that?
Joey  That's fire. Beats everything.
Phoebe  Oh, really? Does it beat water balloon? (She places her hand over his "fire" and mimics a bursting water balloon, thus putting the fire out).
Joey  Ooh! Well played, Phoebe Buffay, well played.
Rachel  Alright, enough, enough, come on. Let's just all go in at the same time.
All  Alright, okay. (Phoebe reaches for the door, and tries to open it but it's locked)
Phoebe  It's locked.
Rachel  Alright, come on... (starts to knock on the door) Alright, you guys. We're so sorry we're late. Please let us in, so we can have dinner together.
Monica  No! Everything's cold. The turkey's dried out and the... the stuffing is all soggy.
Chandler  Yeah, and there's a bowl of cranberry sauce that... (speaking lower to Monica) what happens to cranberry sauce?
Monica  (Rolling her eyes) Nothing. It's fine.
Chandler  (relieved) Oh thank God!
Ross  Come on you guys, we're sorry, alri...? Our subway broke down.
Chandler  (looking through the peephole) That's a lie, you went to the game, I can see Joey's hand.
Ross  (to Joey, who is wearing a blue, 3 foot hand) FOR THE LOVE OF GOD TAKE IT OFF!! (takes it off his hand and throws it on the floor)
Rachel  You guys, come on, it doesn't matter why we're late. We're all here now, please let us in so we can have some of your delicious turkey. (A slice of turkey on a piece of aluminum foil is slid under door)
Joey  I had a dream once about a fax machine that did that. (Ross picks it up)
Monica  That's all the turkey you're gonna get.
Ross  How are we gonna decide who gets this?
Joey  (holds his fist up) WATER BALLOON! (he stuffs the slice in is mouth and gives the foil back to Ross)
Phoebe  What are we gonna do? I'm starving.
Rachel  (gasps) Oh, I just remembered. We do have something to eat. Monica put something in our oven this morning.
Phoebe  Oh yeah!
Monica  Hey, you touch that and you will be sorry.
Chandler  Guys, I'd listen to her. The vein is bigger than I've ever seen it. (Monica looks at Chandler)
Rachel  Huh... OH MY GOD IT'S BRUSSELS SPROUTS. (they all look appalled)
Ross  That's worse than no food.
Chandler  HA-HA! All you got was Monica's stinky Brussels sprouts!
Monica  Stinky?!
Chandler  Please let me stay on this side of the door.
Rachel  Oh, I know... I still have my old key! (She goes in to get it and comes back with her keys) We can just unlock the door.
Phoebe  Well, I don't know if that's such a good idea. They clearly don't want to be with us.
Rachel  You know what? I don't want to be with them either, but it's Thanksgiving and we should not want to be together, together. (Goes to unlock the door)
Joey  (to Ross) Just get in there and make a face to face apology, you know? Look them in the eye. I know I can get them to forgive us.
Ross  I don't know...
Joey  I'm telling ya... (his eyes open wide and he looks like his eyes are about to pop out. He stares at Ross like this without blinking) I can do it.
Ross  (Staring back, and then breaks off) (To Phoebe and Rachel) Yeah, he can do it!
Rachel  Oh!
Chandler  The cranberries...?
Monica  Oh! Enough! A monkey could have made 'em!
Joey  (still with his door wedged in the door gap, now opens his eyes wide and stares at Monica and Chandler as he did with Ross earlier in the hall) Hey listen guys, we feel really terrible.
Chandler  He's doing that weird eye contact thing. Don't look at him, don't look at him! (They both look away)
Joey  Come on you guys, we want you to know we're (His eye widen even more) very very sorry. (Monica and Chandler are now covering their eyes with their hands) (then to the others in the hall) Right guys?
Ross  I feel terrible.
Phoebe and Rachel  So, so sorry.
Joey  (smiling) Now let's not ruin this day. You worked so hard. Let's move past this and try to have a nice meal all together, huh?
Chandler  The floating heads do make a good point.
Monica  Yeah, they do seem to feel pretty bad.
Rachel  So bad.
Ross   So bad.
Phoebe  So bad.
Monica  (Gets up) Okay, okay. You two (to Phoebe and Rachel) go get the dessert. And I'll let you in.
Rachel  Dessert?
Monica  Yeah, I asked you and Phoebe to pick up the pies. You did remember, right?
Phoebe  Pies, oh, we thought you said priiiize (goes to the hall and comes back with Emma's trophy in her hand). Here! (gives it to Monica).
Monica  Grand Supreme Little Darling?
Rachel  Congratulatioooons!
Monica  Oh my God! YOU FORGOT THE PIES? Well, I cannot believe this. You force me to make dinner, then you're an hour late and you forget the one little thing that I asked you to do.
Ross  Really girls, not cool.
Chandler  Well, you manheads aren't any better. You lied about going to the game. You knew it would make you late, and you still went anyway.
Joey  Hey! I'm getting a little tired of this okay? We said we're sorry. It's Thanksgiving for Pete's sakes! A day of forgiveness!
Ross  It's a day to be thankful.
Joey  (to Ross, mouthing) Don't make me come up there!
Monica  It's too late for apologies.
Joey  Fine! Let's just go. I don't need your stupid dinner.
Chandler  That would be a lot more convincing if you weren't drooling.
Rachel  Ewww, is that what that is?
Joey  Sorry!
Phoebe  Come on you guys, let's just do our own Thanksgiving.
Rachel  Yeah! I'll cook!
Ross  Yeah! Let's go out.
Rachel  Hey!
Joey  Yeah! You three have a nice Thanksgiving.
Monica  The three of us?
Joey  Yeah! You, Chan, and the vein!
Joey  Ha!
Joey  Oh-oh! I'm stuck!
Monica  Joey, that is not gonna work.
Joey  No seriously... I'm really wedged in here.
Phoebe  I'll pull you through.
Ross  Okay.
Joey  (in agony) aaw-ahhh-aaahhh STOP! STOP! I'm worried about damaging my head.
Chandler  A little late for that.
Joey  Alright, hurry up, you gotta do something.
Monica  Alright, well, this does not change anything. (to Chandler) Okay, we need to get something to grease the sides of his face.
Chandler  Uhm, we've got turkey grease.
Monica  Bring it.
Joey  I just wanna say that I'm sorry I referred to the vein as a seperate person...
Monica  Here you go!
Joey  Oh, that smells good!
Joey  Okay.
Monica  Okay, try it.
Joey  It isn't working.
Monica  Alright, we're gonna have to unscrew the chain.
Joey  Well hurry, I can't feel my ears!
Chandler  Can you ever feel your ears?
Joey  Interesting...
Monica  Chandler, where are your tools?
Chandler  (sarcastically) Oh, I left them on my bulldozer... I don't have tools!
Monica  I do, but Rachel borrowed them.
Rachel  I lent them to Ross.
Ross  I gave them to Joey.
Joey  I left them at the park.
Monica  Oh!
Ross  (looking at Joey's butt) I'm finding it really hard not to mess with him.
Phoebe  I've already stuffed a bunch of Brussel sprouts down his pants.
Ross  Nice!
Monica  Okay, I have to get that. Now when I get back, I want you and your friends to be gone. Thanksgiving is over. The Vein has spoken.
Joey  It's really starting to hurt.
Chandler  Okay, look, I'm gonna pull on the door and you guys push as hard as you can. Maybe we can get enough room to wiggle him out, okay? Okay, so PUSH!
Phoebe  Just a sec., we're kind in the middle of something here.
Joey  Ooh! Stop putting things down my pants!
Chandler  Come on guys, PUSH!
Joey  Yeah! Come on!
Joey and Chandler  PUSH! PUSH! PUSH!
Chandler  My cranberries!
Joey  (looking at himself) Man, I've got food all over me.
Chandler  Argh! I can't believe what you did. Monica's gonna kill you!
Chandler  (to Monica) Look! Look! Look what the... Look what... Look what the floating heads did!
Monica  (very emotional) I don't care.
Chandler  What's going on?
Monica  That was the adoption agency...
Chandler  And?
Monica  WE'RE GETTING A BABY!
Chandler  Are you serious? (they hug)
Monica  There's a pregnant woman in Ohio, and she picked us!
Rachel  I'm so happy for you!
Monica  This Thanksgiving kicks last Thanksgiving's ass!
[Scene  Chandler and Monica's apartment. The table is set, and there's food on the tables again. They're all there, toasting.]
Rachel  To Monica and Chandler... and that knocked up girl in Ohio.
Ross  I'm just so happy you guys are finally getting a kid.
Phoebe  I know. Have you considered pageanting?
Monica  I can't believe they called, and we're actually getting a baby. (she kisses Chandler)
Joey  Oh, I know how you feel...
Rachel  Really?
Joey  Sure. I went through the exact same thing with Alicia Mae Emory... The waiting, the wandering... Then one day... I get that call from Toys "R" Us... She was in stock!
Chandler  That is the exact same thing.
[Scene  Central Perk. Everyone's sitting on the couch.Monica and Chandler enter]
Chandler   Hi!
Ross  Hey!
Monica  Hey!
Chandler  We're just here to say goodbye, we're off to Ohio.
Phoebe  Oh, right! Your adoption interview!
Monica  Yep, we're gonna meet the lady who could be carrying our baby.
Joey  I can't believe it. When you guys come back, you're gonna have a baby! That is so weird!
Chandler  And so incorrect!
Monica  She's only a couple of months pregnant. She liked our application but who knows if she's gonna like us.
Ross  Come on, she's gonna love you guys!
Chandler  Uhm, thank you, but we're really trying not to get our hopes up.
Monica  And a lot could still get in our way.
Chandler  Yeah. I mean, this girl could decide against adoption or she could like another couple better..
Phoebe  What are you gonna name the baby?
Chandler  I can develop a condition in which I talk and talk and no one hears a word.
Joey  But just think, ok? What if everything goes right? What if this woman does pick you guys?
Monica  Oh my God. She's gonna pick us!
Chandler  So we're standing firm on the 'not getting our hopes up'?
Monica  You know, I know that things could still go wrong but if they don't? If this works out, we're gonna have a baby Chandler, a baby!
Chandler  Yes, but...
Monica  Oh my God, it's gonna WORK! We're gonna make it work! I'm gonna be a mummy and (to Chandler) you're gonna be a daddy! All right, I'll see you suckers. I'm gonna get me... A BABY! {she leaves)
Chandler  Oh, screw it, I'm gonna be a daddy!!
[Scene  Central Perk. Phoebe's speaking to a girl.]
Rachel  (to Joey) Hey, who's Phoebe with?
Joey  I'm gonna say someone I'm gonna have sex with. (the girl leaves and Phoebe goes toward the couch) (to Phoebe) Hey!
Phoebe  Hey!
Joey  So... who's your friend?
Phoebe  Oh, that's Sarah. No, no. Don't you get any ideas, ok? No, I'm not setting you up with any more of my friends!
Joey  OW, why, why, why?
Phoebe  Because you'll date her once, sleep with her and then forget she exists!
Joey  Oh, name one friend of yours that I did that with.
Phoebe  Mandy.
Joey  Mandy, uh? Uh... really hot blonde, big boobs?
Phoebe  No.
Joey  I know why I don't remember her, huh? (he winks at Rachel)
Rachel  Do you think I'm someone else?
Joey  Ok, I may not have treated your friends well in the past, but I have grown up a lot, really. Honest, Rach?
Rachel  Well, believe it or not, it's true. When Joey and I were together, he was wonderful. He was thoughtful and mature. And for the one week that we went out, he didn't sleep with anybody else!
Joey  (pointing at himself) Growth!
Phoebe  Fine, I'll give you her number.
Joey  Ok, thank you. And I promise you I will not forget this one. (he starts writing on his hand) Mandy.
Phoebe  SARAH!
Joey  Saraaah.
Ross  (entering) Hey!
Rachel  Hi!
Ross  Hey you guys, I need some fashion advice.
Rachel  Oh!
Ross  (he takes a baby blue beret out of a shopping box and puts it on) How does this look?
Rachel  Well, it's a little low... pick up a little... (Ross picks it up) a little bit more... (he picks it up again) a little bit more... (he takes it off) There you go! (pause) Now throw it away!
Ross  C'mon! This looks good!
Rachel  Ross, please, trust me. I buy 30 fashion magazines a month. Now, I don't know who's running for president or who that... NATO guy is, but I do know that you have to get as far away as you can from that hat.
Ross  Damnit! I have this date tomorrow night and I have to look cool!
Phoebe  Well, you know, if you want fashion help, Rachel and I are going shopping tomorrow. You're more than welcome to come with us, right?
Ross  Really? That would be great. I mean, I have to do something, she kinda teased me about how I dress.
Joey  I can see why, nice shirt!
Ross  You're wearing the same shirt.
Joey  Stupid Gap on every corner!
[Scene  The Adoption Agency in Ohio. Monica and Chandler are entering with a man.]
Agency guy  Please, make yourself comfortable and I will back in a moment with Erica.
Monica  Ok, thank you.(the man leaves) Uh, well this is it. Are you OK?
Monica  Uh, we're gonna be great.
Chandler  You're gonna be great.
Monica  Well... obviously!
Agency guy  (he enters with Erica) Monica, Chandler. I'd like you to meet Erica.
Monica  Hi. It is so, so nice to meet you.
Erica  (whispering) Hi...
Chandler  Thank you so much for agreeing to see us.
Erica  Hi.
Agency guy  I'll let you get acquainted.
Chandler  Ok.
Erica  So, it's Monica and Chandler. I only know you as file 0W33815-D.
Chandler  That's what our friends call us.
Erica  Gosh, you know, you're just such an amazing couple. It's... kind of intimidating.
Monica  I don't know about that.
Erica  You're kidding me? I mean, it's enough that you are a doctor. But on top of it, you're married to a reverend?
Chandler  (astonished) I don't think that's exactly...
Monica  (overlapping) Let her finish, doctor.
[Scene  Central Perk]
Joey  Hey.
Phoebe  Oh, my friend Sarah had a great time last night.
Joey  Well...
Phoebe  Yeah! So you're gonna call this one back?
Joey  Nope.
Phoebe  What are you talking about? Sarah's great!
Joey  Oh, really? You know what your great friend did? We're out to dinner, ok? (he starts talking about the date and we can see what happened through a flashback video) We're getting along, having a really nice time. I was thinking she was really cool. And then, out of nowhere...
Phoebe  That’s it? That’s why you won’t go out with her again? So, she took some fries, big deal!
Joey  Hey, hey, look! It’s not about a few fries... it’s about what the fries represent.
Phoebe  What?
Joey  ALL FOOD!
Phoebe  I’m sorry, I can’t believe I set you up with such a MONSTER!
Joey  Hey, hey, hey, hey. Look. I take a girl out, she can order whatever she wants! The more, the better! All right? Just don’t order a Garden salad and then eat my food! That’s a good way to lose some fingers!
Phoebe  (to Rachel) Oh
Rachel  Hi
Phoebe  Thank God you’re here. Listen to this!
Rachel  what?
Phoebe  Joey and my friend were out last night and having dinner and she reaches over and takes a few of his fries...
Rachel  Oh! Oh, no!
Phoebe  What? You know about the plate thing?
Rachel  Oh, yeah. Joey doesn’t share food. I mean, just last week we were having breakfast and he had a couple of grapes on his plate and ...
Phoebe  (to Joey) You wouldn’t let her have a grape?
Rachel  Oh no! Not me! Emma!
Joey  (mad and pointing a finger to himself) JOEY DOESN’T SHARE FOOD!
Phoebe  Well, I still think that it’s a stupid reason not to call someone again. You are calling her! And if you need to, just get an extra plate of fries for the table!
Joey  (he thinks a little, considering the option and seems to be quite satisfied) I like that! A sharing buffer! Yeah! I’ll order some extra fries! Maybe a plate of onion rings. Yeah. And a shrimp cocktail. And some buffalo wings. Maybe an individual pizza, uh? And some mozzarella sticks. (he looks absorbed in his food thoughts) What were we talking about?
[Scene  A clothes store. Ross and Phoebe are shopping]
Ross  You know, we should just go, I’m not gonna find anything here! This stuff is ridiculous!
Rachel  Ah, this place is great!
Phoebe  Wow!
Ross  Rach, come on, I’m not gonna wear any of this! (he picks up a shirt) Nothing silver. (Rachel sighs). Ok? Nothing with hair! (Rachel sighs again) And nothing with padlocks on it! (Rachel heaves a long disappointing sigh).
Rachel  Ross, look, I know that some of this stuff is out there, but I mean, come on, look at this, look at this sweater! (she picks up a blue sweater). I mean, this is just beautiful!
Ross  (feeling the fabric) Wow, this is really soft (he looks the price). Three hundred and fifty dollars?
Rachel  Yeah, down from seven hundred, you are saving like two hundred bucks!
Ross  Both logic and math are taking a serious hit today.
Phoebe (walking to Ross carrying a black leather jacket)  Hey, check this out! It’s totally you!
Ross  Wow!
Phoebe  Yeah!
Ross  Actually this looks like pretty good! Yeah!(he turns and watches his back and there’s a sign on the back of the jacket, “boys will be boys”) Boys will be boys?
Phoebe  What? They will be!
Ross  All right, that’s it, I’m getting out of here.
Rachel  No, no, no, no! Ross, wait! Come on! You know, there’s other stuff. Here’s a nice shirt, look at these nice pants...
Ross  Uh, actually these might look pretty good on me.
Rachel  Yes, they will! You know what you should do? Just go take a walk, all right? I know your size and I’m... I’m gonna pick up some really good stuff for you.
Ross  Really?
Rachel  Yes! And I know what looks sexy on guys. Please, just wear what I suggest, and she’s gonna go nuts for you.
Ross  So, you’re saying, uh, if I wear these pants I might be getting into hers?
Rachel  (to Phoebe) Why do men keep talking to me like this?
[Scene  The Adoption Agency in Ohio. Monica and Chandler are still talking with Erica.]
Chandler  So, the fact that I am a doctor, and my wife’s a reverend, that’s important to you?
Erica  Yeah, I read some great applications, but then I thought “who better then a minister to raise a child!”
Monica  Amen.
Chandler  Plus I thought the baby would be in good hands with a doctor!
Monica  Uh, good hands. (she holds Chandler hands) Healing hands.
Erica  Reverend, can I ask? Does the bible say anything about adoption?
Monica  It says “Do it!”. And behold she did adopt onto them a baby. And it was good.
Erica  Wow.
Chandler  Yeah, wow.
Erica  I was wondering you both have such serious jobs. (to Monica) Would you have time to take care of a baby and your flock?
Monica  Oh, you know, my flock is good, I mean, yeah, my flock pretty much takes care of themselves at this point. Good flock. Flock, flock, flock.
Erica  (to Chandler) Being a doctor must take up a lot of time.
Chandler  No-ot for me it doesn’t.
Agency guy  So, how’s everything going in here?
Erica  We’re great, I think I may have asked all my questions.
Agency guy  Do you have any question for Erica?
Chandler  Yeah, actually. So, you read a file that you liked and you gave the agency the serial number and they contacted us?
Agency guy  Yes, our system assures total anonimity. We’re very proud of it.
Chandler  You should be. You’re really on top of stuff..
Agency guy  (to Erica) Well, then if there’s nothing else, then the two of us should talk.
Erica  Actually, I don’t think we have to.
Monica  We don’t?
Erica  Yeah, when I read about you two, I was pretty sure I wanted you, but I just thought we should meet face to face. (to the agency guy). I've made my decision. I choose them.
Monica  Oh my God, this is great! This is so great! (to Chandler, who looks bewildered). Did you hear that?
Chandler  Yeah, I did.
Monica  (to Erica) Hey, thank you. Thank you so much. (they hugs). You are SO going to Heaven!
[Scene  Joey’s apartment. Rachel and Phoebe walk in, loaded with bags.]
Rachel  We got some really great stuff!
Phoebe  Yeah, yeah but I am not sure about some of the bra's I got.
Rachel  Oh! Really? Do you wanna try some of them on for me?
Phoebe  Oh! okay. Wait, are we in Joey's imagination?
Rachel  (looking into one of her shopping bags) Oh no! I took one of Ross' bags by  
  mistake, and one of mine is missing.
Phoebe  oh, well, Ross probably has it, you can get it from him later.
[Scene  Ross walks into Central Perk, wearing a pink and white ladies shirt. Joey is on the couch]
Ross  (to Joey) So? What do you think? (Shows himself - Joey observes him with a strange look on his face.)
Joey  I think were not wearing the same shirt anymore!!
Ross  (not getting it) Yeah! Yeah! Rachel picked it out for me. She told me to trust her and you know what? I'm glad I did! I turned quite a few heads on my way over here.
Joey  (now laughing a little) Dude, I really don't think you should be wearing that.
Ross  Oh, I see, somebody is afraid of a little competition with the ladies?
Joey  (looking a little agitated now) Looks like someone IS the ladies!!
Ross  You're just jealous because you couldn't pull this off. Yeah, now if you'll excuse me (getting up and taking his coat) I have a date. (As he is walking out, everyone turns and stares at him) See? (To Joey) ALL eyes on ME!
[Scene  Monica and Chandler's hotel room. They enter.]
Chandler  We are NOT signing those papers.
Monica  Why not?
Chandler  It's wrong. They made a mistake. They think we're somebody else.
Monica  God works in mysterious ways.
Chandler  You have gotta stop!
Monica  But she liked us.
Chandler  She likes Doctor Chandler and Reverend Monica.
Monica  Well, if you think about it, I am kind of like a Reverend. I mean, as a chef, I serve God, by feeing the hungry and poor. (looks very convinced about what she just said)
Chandler  Your Veal Chop is $34,95!
Monica  C'mon Chandler, I think we have been given an opportunity. I mean, the mistake has already been made. They are writing up the paper right now.
Chandler  But we are not the one she chose! How can you feel okay about this?
Monica  (very emotional) Because... We may not be who she thinks we are but no-one will ever love that baby more than us.
Chandler  I know..
Monica  I mean, who knows how long it's gonna take for someone else to give us a baby? What if, what if no one ever picks us?
Chandler  oh, honey..
Monica  (Almost crying) Please.. please, we are so close.
Chandler  So, we'll tell the truth and who knows, maybe she'll like us for us.
Monica  (sniffing) Maybe she will. Uh! Why couldn't I have been a Reverend?
Chandler  You're Jewish.
Monica  Technicality!
[Scene  A restaurant. Joey is on his date with Phoebe’s friend, Sarah. They are sitting opposite each other on a table for two. Their waiter approaches with two plates.]
Waiter  A garden salad for the lady (sets the plate down)
Joey  Oh, that looks great! Good ordering!
Waiter  Seafood platter for the gentleman and extra fries. Enjoy!
Sarah  Mmmh, those fries look delicious.
Joey  oh, I didn't know you liked French fries. Help yourself! What's mine is yours. (Sarah reaches over and takes a few fries)
Sarah  (looks over at Joey's platter) Oh wow, are those stuffed clams?
Joey  Uuuh.. yes, they are my stuffed clams.
Joey  How about those fries though, huh? (Holds the plate between Sarah’s fingers and his plate, thus blocking her from reaching his)
Sarah  They are delicious (takes a few from the plate, puts one in her mouth and places the rest on her plate, then starts to reach over to Joey's platter again)
Joey  (Spotting her movements takes her hand into his own) You are beautiful, you know that?
Sarah  Oh, that is so sweet..
Joey  Oh (grinning, trying to hold in his impatience with her) okay.. (she takes her hand back)
Joey  (Visibly annoyed) NOW look what you did!!
Sarah  What? what is the matter with you?
Joey  I don't like it when people take food off of my plate, okay?
Sarah  But you just said "What's mine is yours"?
Joey  WELL, I DIDN'T MEAN IT!
Sarah  Fine, I'm sorry, I didn't think it was that big a deal.
Joey  I'm sorry, I'm overreacting. Okay, It's just when it comes to food, I have certain rules, okay, I mean (bends down and with his plate and his hands, scrapes the dropped dinner back onto the plate and puts it back on the table) There are things you do..and you now, things.. (takes something from the plate and blows it a little) that you don't do (He takes a bite from it).
[Scene  Ross and his date walk into a lobby. They are both wearing their jackets]
Girl  Wow, this place looks great.
Ross  Oh! You are gonna love it! (The girl is looking in the other direction as Ross is taking off his own coat, revealing the pink and white ladies shirt) and I'm so glad, we're finally doing this.
Girl  Me too! (starts to take her coat off)
Ross  Here (gets behind her to help. When the coat comes off we see she is wearing the exact same shirt Ross is wearing. They look at each other, shocked. They abruptly put their coat back on) So this was fun! (They leave the room and head into opposite directions)
[Scene  Back at the restaurant with Joey and Sarah. Joey is holding Sarah's hands]
Joey  I really am sorry about, you know..before. I just want to make sure you know that I really do like you.
Sarah  Sure (smiling) Just not as much as clams.
Joey  (Jokingly) Well, stuffed clams.
Waiter  Chocolate Torte for the lady, cheesecake for the gentleman.
Joey  Uh, excuse me sir, there seems to be some sort of red crap on my cheesecake.
Waiter  Yes, that's Raspberry coule.
Joey  (More to himself than anyone else) So stupid, ordering cheesecake, trying to  
  be healthy. (pushes it aside)
Sarah  (tasting hers) Oh my God! (Looks at the waiter and then to Joey)
Joey  Oh, all right, I'll just have what she's having instead.
Waiter  Oh, I'm sorry sir, that was our last piece.
Sarah  Mmmm! Mmm!
Sarah  Oh, no! This is work. I should call in. Can you excuse me?
Joey  Oh yeah, sure. No problem.
Sarah  What are you doing? I thought you don't share food.
Joey  Sure I do. (holding up his own dessert) Coule?
Sarah  (laughing) No. If I can't have your clams, you can't have my dessert. This is a two way street.
Joey  (laughing) Really?
Sarah  Really! Now this all better be here when I come back. (puts her plate back at her side of the table)
Joey  Yeah, of course. I can control myself. (laughs uneasily and Sarah leaves the room)
Joey  (to the torte) Stop staring at me!
Joey  Why, just a tiny little...
Joey  Oh-oh!
Joey  I'm not even sorry.
[Scene  The Adoption Agency in Ohio. Monica and Chandler are entering.]
Erica  Hi!
Adoption Agency guy  Hey.
Chandler  Hey.
Agency guy  So, these are the preliminary forms for an open adoption. There's a lot to go over, but I'll explain everything as we go through it.
Monica  (pointing to a picture on the table) I-Is... Is that a picture?
Erica  Yeah. It's a sonogram they took of the baby last week. I thought you might want to see it. (gives it to Monica, who looks at it for a long time, and then shows it to Chandler)
Monica  Look, doctor!
Agency guy  I don't understand.
Chandler  The agency must have made some mistake. My wife is not a reverend and I'm not a doctor.
Erica  What?
Agency guy  That's impossible.
Chandler  I could perform an operation on you and prove it if you'd like.
Agency guy  I'll go check your file. Excuse me.
Erica  So who are you?
Chandler  Well, our names really are Monica and Chandler. We're from New York.
Monica  Yeah, but the important thing to know about us, is how much we would care for this little baby. (holds up the sonogram)
Erica  So you lied to me before?
Monica  Well, we... (makes quotation signs in the air) "bore false witness"... See I could be a reverend.
Erica  I can't believe this.
Monica  But we were hoping that since we told you the truth that you still might consider...
Erica  Giving you my baby? You think I'd give you my child after this?
Monica  Well, you don't have to decide right now, but if you could just look at our file...
Erica  I don't want to look at your file! This is over.
Chandler  Erica wait!
Erica  I've nothing to say to you. (walks a few paces)
Chandler  You have every reason to be upset. We did lie. But only because we've been waiting and trying to have a baby for so long. Now we don't know how long it's gonna be before we can get another chance again.
Erica  Why don't you ask the reverend to pray on it?
Chandler  Erica, please. Just consider us. Ask them to see our file. Our last name's Bing. My wife's a chef and I'm in advertising.
Erica  Oh yeah. I actually liked you guys. But it doesn't matter, because what you did was wrong. (walks away again, but Chandler catches up with her again)
Chandler  But you did like us. And you should. My wife's an incredible woman. She's loving and devoted and caring. And don't tell her I said this but the woman's always right... I love my wife more than anything in this world. And I... It kills me that I can't give her a baby... I really want a kid. And when that day finally comes, I'll learn how to be a good dad. But my wife... she's already there. She's a mother... without a baby... Please?
Chandler  You still want that baby?
Monica  God bless you Chandler Bing!
[Scene  Central Perk. Joey's on the couch when Ross walks to him, with his jacket closed.]
Ross  Turns out this sweater is made for a woman.
Joey  (nods) So, why are you still wearing it?
Ross  Because it's soft... Hey, so how was your date?
Joey  Ooh... Not so good.
Ross  Well, looks like it's just the two of us tonight, huh old buddy?
Joey  Yeah, and you know what? We could do a lot worse.
Joey  (shouting to Ross) JOEY DOESN'T SHARE FOOD!
Monica  (really excited) Mmh... this cake is amazing!
Rachel  My God, get a room!
Monica  I would get a room with this cake. I think I could show this cake a good time!
Phoebe  If you had to, what would you give up, food or sex?
Monica  (with no hesitation) Sex!
Chandler  (looking at her) Seriously, answer faster!
Monica  Oh, I'm sorry honey, you know, but when she said "sex" I wasn't thinking about "sex with you"!
Chandler  (to Phoebe) It's like a giant hug.
Phoebe  Ross, how about you. What would you give up, sex or food?
Ross  Food.
Phoebe  Ok, how about... uhm... sex or dinosaurs?
Ross  Oh my God. It's like Sophie's Choice.
Rachel  Oh God. What about you, Joe? What would you give up, sex or food?
Joey  Uhm... oh... I don't know, it's too hard.
Rachel  No, you gotta pick one!
Joey  Oh... food. No, sex. Food! Sex! Food! Se-I don't know! Good God, I don't know, I want girls on bread!
[Scene  Central Perk. Rachel and Phoebe are looking at some photos and they're sitting next to the window.]
Rachel  You gotta see these latest pictures of Emma.
Phoebe  Oh, how cute!
Rachel  Yeah.
Phoebe  Oh, she looks just like a little doll!
Rachel  Oh, no, no. That is a doll.
Phoebe  Oh, thank God, 'cause that thing's really creepy! (looking outside the window) Look, there's Chandler. (he's on the street, talking to a woman)
Rachel  Oh. Who is the blonde, she's pretty.
Phoebe  OH! He's having an affair.
Rachel  He's not having an affair!
Phoebe  You know, I'm always right about these things.
Rachel  No, you're not! Last week you thought Ross was trying to kill you!
Phoebe  Well, I'm sorry but it's hard to believe that anyone would tell a story that dull just to tell it! (looking outside) See, there's something going on with them. Look, he's getting into the car with her!
Rachel  Oh, that doesn't mean anything.
Phoebe  Oh yeah? Well, let's see. (she takes her mobile phone) Ok, duck down. (they both get down to hide themselves. Phoebe calls Chandler)
Chandler  (picking up the phone) Hello.
Phoebe  Oh, hi Chandler. It's Phoebe. Uhm... I know that Monica is working today so...(back to Central Perk) ...I was wondering if you want to come to the movies with me and Rachel.
Chandler  Oh, uhm... I have to work too. Yeah, I'm stuck at the office all day.
Phoebe  (shocked) Oh, well, it's a shame that you-that you miss the movie 'cause we were gonna see, you know, either "Liar, Liar" or "Betrayal", or... "An Affair To Remember".
Chandler  Those are all really old!
Phoebe  Ok, then maybe it'll be, uhm...
Rachel  (whispering) "Dude, Where's My Car?"
Phoebe  (glancing at her) What?
Rachel  They're in a caaar...
Phoebe  (to Chandler at the phone) Okay, we-we'll talk to you later. Okay, bye.
Rachel  Geez!
Phoebe  Ok. Quick. We gotta find a cab and follow them.
Rachel  Oh, yeah, ok. Let me just grab my night vision goggles and my stun gun.
Phoebe  (patting her bag) I got them!
[Scene  Monica’s apartment. Chandler enters the door.]
Chandler  Hi!
Monica  Hey! You smell like perfume and cigarettes.
Chandler  I was in the car with Nancy all day.
Monica  Nancy doesn’t smoke!
Chandler  Well, at least the perfume is not mine, be thankful for that!
Monica  So? What do you think of the house?
Chandler  It’s perfect. It’s everything we’ve been looking for.
Monica  Isn’t it? Then what about the amazing wainscotting and the crown molding and the dormer windows in the attic?
Chandler  And the wiggle wharms and the zip zorps? (pause) What were the things you said?
Monica  Don’t you love the huge yard?
Chandler  And the fireplace in the bedroom.
Monica  And Nancy said that it's really under price, because the guy lost his job and has to move in with his parents!
Chandler  This is bringing out a lovely color in you!
Monica  So? Do you think we should get it?
Chandler  I don’t know. What do you think?
Monica  I think we should.
Chandler  I do too.
Monica  This is huge!
Chandler  I know.
Monica  How bad you wanna smoke, right now.
Chandler  I don’t know what you mean, giant talking cigarette! Oh, by the way, Phoebe called just as I was getting into Nancy’s car, so if she asks you, I was at work all day.
Monica  Gotcha. When do we tell them about this?
Chandler  We don’t. Not until it's a hundred percent. I mean, why upset everybody over nothing.
Monica  Okay. Right. Oh my God that is gonna be so hard.
Chandler  I know. Gooooood luck with it.
[Scene  Joey’s apartment. Everybody except Monica and Chandler is there.]
Ross  I just can’t see Chandler cheating!
Rachel  I’m telling you guys, we followed them out to a house in Westchester, the went in for like forty-five minutes and then they came out looking pretty happy!
Joey  Chandler? Forty-five minutes? Well, something is not right. I just can’t believe he would do this to Monica!
Ross  I know, and with the baby coming?
Phoebe  So, should we tell her?
Ross  I don’t know. Phoebe, if one of us saw Mike with another woman would you want us to tell you?
Phoebe  Why? Who’d you seen him with?
Ross  No one, I’m just saying if... (Phoebe starts pinching him in his neck)
Phoebe  TELL ME WHAT YOU KNOW!
Ross  (yelling in pain) I know nothing! Mike’s a great guy, it was hypothetical!
Phoebe  All right. (she releases him). He is a good guy. You’re right, he wouldn’t cheat.
Ross  Believe me, if I did see with someone, there’s no way I... (Phoebe starts pinching him again)
Phoebe   WHO DID YOU SEE HIM WITH?
[Scene  Monica’s apartment. Monica is cleaning with a vacuum and then she cleans it with a dust buster. The guys enter the room.]
Rachel  Oh, look at her, so happy!
Monica  If only there were a smaller one to clean this one!
Joey  Hey, is uhm... is Chandler here?
Monica  No, he’s picking up dinner, why, what’s up?
Phoebe  Well, look, whatever happens, we’re here for you and we love you.
Monica (puzzled)  All right...
Ross  We think Chandler might be having an affair.
Monica  What?
Rachel  Phoebe and I saw Chandler with a blonde woman today outside on the street and then we followed them to a house in Westchester.
Phoebe  They went in together. So sorry.
Monica  Oh my God! Oh my God that’s awful! What did you think of the house?
Phoebe  What?
Joey  (walking towards her to hold her and support her) Monica, you understand what we are saying, right?
Monica  Yeah, sure... uhm, I'm devastated, obviously... (to the rest) Did you think the neighborhood was homey? (Chandler enters)
Chandler  Hey!
Joey  (to Chandler) You son of a bitch!
Chandler  Is it me, or have the greetings gone downhill around here?
Monica  (goes to Chandler) Phoebe and Rachel saw you with Nancy today and... em... they think you're having an affair.
Rachel  Who's Nancy?
Ross  What's going on?
Monica  (turns to them) Ok, alright, you guys, you'd better sit down, this is pretty big.
Chandler  Yeah (motions them to sit and they do) I'm not having an affair. Nancy is our realtor.
Joey  I knew he couldn't be with a woman for 45 minutes!!
Phoebe  Why do you have a realtor?
Monica  Uhm, she has been showing us houses outside of the city.
Joey  (clearly shocked) What?
Rachel  Are you serious?
Monica  When we found out that we're gonna get this baby, Chandler and I started talking and we decided that we didn't want to raise a kid in the city.
Phoebe  So you're gonna move?
Ross  Oh my God.
Joey  Shouldn't we all vote on stuff like this?!
Rachel  What is wrong with raising a kid in the city? I'm doing it, Ross is doing it, Sarah Jessica Parker is doing it!
Monica  And that's great for you guys, but we want a lawn and a swingset...
Chandler  ...and a street where our kids can ride their bikes and maybe an ice-cream truck can go by.
Ross  (sarcastic) So you wanna buy a house in the 50's?
Phoebe  Have you thought about what you would be giving up? You can't move out of the city, what if you want Chinese food at 5am? Or a fake Rolex that breaks as soon as it rains or an Asian hooker sent right to your door?
Ross  You know what, if you wanna look for a house, that's okay.
Joey  No, no, it's not, don't listen to him! (to Ross) I'm gonna thump you! (points his fist at him)
Ross  (to Joey) It's ok, because they have to get it out of their system, okay (back to Mon and Chan), but you're going to realize, this is the only place, you wanna be.
Chandler  Actually, we already found a house we love.
Ross  What?
Monica  And about an hour ago, we made an offer.
Chandler  Bet you wish I was having an affair now, huh?
Ross  You put an offer on a house?
Monica  (smiling) It's so sweet. It really is. It has this big yard that leads down to this stream and then there's these old maple trees... (gets cut off)
Phoebe  Wha..? Again with the nature, what are you? Beavers?
Chandler  I know this is really hard and we're really sorry.
Joey  Is this because I come over here without knocking and eat your food? (Walks towards the fridge) Because I can stop doing that, (looks at the fridge) I really, really think I can!
Chandler  (goes towards Joey) You know that's not the reason Joe. (Joey hugs him and after, he takes something from the fridge and puts it in his mouth. He goes back to where he was standing before)
Monica  We think if you saw it, you'd understand. I mean you guys were there. (Points to Rachel and Phoebe) It is beautiful, isn't it?
Rachel  Yeah it is.
Joey  What the hell are you doin'?
Phoebe  Yeah, but so is this.
Ross  Yeah, I mean, if you moved there, you have to leave here. I mean, how can you leave this place?
Rachel  (talking on the phone) C'mon Daddy, listen to me! All of my life, everyone has always told me, 'You're a shoe! You're a shoe, you're a shoe, you're a shoe!'. And today I just stopped and I said, 'What if I don't wanna be a shoe? What if I wanna be a- a purse, y'know? Or a- or a hat! No, I don't want you to buy me a hat, I'm saying that I am a ha- It's a metaphor, Daddy!
Ross  You can see where he'd have trouble.
Rachel  Well maybe I'll just stay here with Monica.
Monica  Well, I guess we've established who's staying here with Monica...
Ross  That money is mine, Green!
Rachel  You're fly is open, Geller!
Phoebe  You guys, you know what I just realized? 'Joker' is 'poker' with a 'J.' Coincidence?
Chandler  Hey, that's...'joincidence' with a 'C'!
Phoebe  [looking outside the window] Eww, look. Ugly Naked Guy lit a bunch of candles.
Rachel  Ow, that had to hurt!
Phoebe  Hey, it’s your Thanksgiving too, y'know, instead of watching football, you could help.
The Guys  We will. (they don’t move)
Monica  Okay, Rachel, you wanna put the marshmallows in concentric circles.
Rachel  No Mon, you want to put them in concentric circles. I want to do this.
Monica  Every year.
Joey  (he has a turkey on his head) It's stuck!!!
Phoebe  (walks him to the kitchen) Easy. Step. How did it get on?
Joey  I put it on to scare Chandler!
Phoebe  Oh my God! Monica's gonna totally freak out!
Joey  It smells really bad in here.
Phoebe  Well, of course it smells really bad. You have your head inside a turkey's ass!
Monica  Hey, did you get the turkey bast-Oh my God! Oh my God! (She sees someone is stuck in the turkey.) Who is that?
Joey  It's Joey.
Monica  I got it! How about, if we win, they have to get rid of the rooster?
Rachel  Oooohh that’s interesting.
Chandler  If you win, we give up the birds.
Joey  (shocked) Dah!! (Chandler motions for him to calm down.)
Chandler  But if we win, we get your apartment.
Joey  Oooooh!
Monica  Deal!
Ross  What was Monica’s nickname when she was a field hockey goalie?
Joey  Big fat goalie.
Ross  Correct. Rachel claims this is her favorite movie…
Chandler  Dangerous Liaisons.
Ross  Correct. Her actual favorite movie is...
Joey  Weekend at Bernie’s.
Ross  Monica categorizes her towels. How many categories are there?
Joey  Everyday use.
Chandler  Fancy.
Joey  Guest.
Chandler  Fancy guest.
Ross  Two seconds...
Joey  Uhh, 11!
Ross  11, unbelievable, 11 is correct. (The guys celebrate.)
Ross  (to the girls) Chandler was how old when he first touched a girl’s breast?
Rachel  14?
Ross  No, 19.
Chandler  Thanks man.
Ross  Joey had an imaginary childhood friend. His name was?
Monica  Maurice.
Ross  Correct, his profession was?
Rachel  Space cowboy!
Ross  Correct! What is Chandler Bing’s job?
Rachel  Ow...Oh Gosh!
Ross  10 seconds, you need this or you lose the game.
Monica  It’s umm, it has something to do with transponding.
Rachel  Oh-oh-oh, he’s a transponce—transpondster!
Monica  That’s not even a word!
Monica  NOOOOOOOOO!!!!!
Rachel  Y’know what, you are mean boys, who are just being mean!
Joey  Hey, don’t get mad at us! No one forced you to raise the stakes!
Rachel  That is not true. She did! She forced me!
Monica  Hey, we would still be living here if hadn’t gotten the question wrong!
Rachel  Well it stupid, unfair question!
Ross  Don’t blame the questions!
Chandler  Would you all stop yelling in our apartment! You are ruining moving day for us!
Ross  Chandler!!! Chandler!!! (He opens the door to the apartment but is stopped by the chain; Chandler and Monica quickly stop making out and try to get dressed.) Chandler, I saw what you were doing through the window! Chandler, I saw what you were doing to my sister! Now get out here!
Chandler  (To Monica) Wow! Listen, we had a good run. You know, what was it? Four? Five months? I mean, that's more than most people have in a lifetime! So, good-bye, take care, bye-bye then! (He kisses her and starts to climb out the balcony window)
Monica  (She opens the door.) Hey Ross. What's up bro?
Ross  What the hell are doing?!!
Rachel  (running from the guy's apartment with Joey in tow) Hey, what's-what's going on?!
Chandler  Well, I think, I think Ross knows about me and Monica.
Joey  (panicking) Dude! He's right there!
Ross  (To Chandler) I thought you were my best friend, this is my sister! My best friend and my sister! I-I cannot believe this!
Chandler  Look, we're not just messing around! I love her. Okay, I'm in love with her.
Monica  I'm so sorry that you had to find out this way. I'm sorry, but iit-t's true, I love him too.
Ross  (happily) My best friend and my sister! I cannot believe this. (He hugs them both.)
Monica  Well, this is the last box of your clothes. I’m just gonna label it, "What were you thinking?"
Rachel  Funny, because I was just gonna go across the hall and write that on Chandler.
Phoebe  Ok, you guys, I don’t mean to make things worse, but umm, I don’t want to live with Rachel anymore.
Monica and Rachel  What?!
Phoebe  You’re just so mean to each other! And I don’t want to end up like that with Rachel. I still like you!
Rachel  Well, Phoebe that’s fine because I’m not moving.
Monica  Whoa-whoa-whoa, Phoebe you gotta take her! Y’know, I-I-I said some really bad stuff about her, but y’know Rachel has some good qualities that make her a good roommate. She gets tons of catalogs and umm, she’ll fold down the pages of the things she thinks that I’d like.
Phoebe  What else?
Monica  When I take a shower, she leaves me little notes on the mirror.
Rachel  Yeah, I do. I-I do, do that.
Phoebe  That’s nice. I like having things to read in the bathroom.
Monica  When I fall asleep on the couch after reading, she covers me over with a blanket.
Rachel  Well y’know, I don’t want you to be cold.
Monica  And when I told her that I was gonna be moving in with Chandler, she was really supportive. (To Rachel) (Starts to cry) You were so great. You made it so easy. And now you have to leave. And I have to live with a boy!! (They both break down in tears.)
Chandler  (entering) Hey.
Monica  She really left.
Chandler  I know. (He kisses her.)
Monica  Thank you.
Chandler  No problem roomie. (She turns around and hugs him.)
Monica  Can I ask you a question?
Chandler  Sure!
Monica  What the hell is that dog doing here?! (She notices the dog sitting in the living room.)
Chandler  Little toast here. I know this isn't exactly the kind of Thanksgiving that all of you all planned, but for me, this has been really great, you know, I think because it didn't involve divorce or projectile vomiting. Anyway, I was just thinking, I mean, if you'd gone to Vail, and if you guys'd been with your family, if you didn't have syphilis and stuff, we wouldn't be all together, you know? So I guess what I'm trying to say is that I'm very thankful that all of your Thanksgivings sucked.
All  That's so sweet.
Ross  And hey, here's to a lousy Christmas.
Rachel  And a crappy New Year.
Chandler  Here, here!
[Scene  We're back to the present. Chandler and Monica's. They're all still at the kitchen table.]
Rachel  You can't move. You just... you just can't.
Joey  Rachel's right. This is where you guys belong.
Phoebe  Yeah, you don't wanna live in Westchester. That's like the worst of the Chesters.
Ross  You know, sometimes when I'm alone in my apartment, I look over here and you guys... are just having dinner or... watching TV or something, but... it makes me feel better. And now when I look over, who am I gonna see? The Gottliebs, the Yangs? They don't make me feel so good. (Joey pats Ross on his back)
Rachel  Yeah. So don't move, okay? Just stay here and... (nods towards Ross) maybe close your blinds at night.
Chandler  Hello? It's Nancy, they responded to our offer.
Monica  And?
Chandler  (to Nancy) Okay, thanks... (to Monica) They passed. They said they wouldn't go a penny under the asking price.
Monica  We can't afford that.
Chandler  I know.
Monica  Well, there you go.
Joey  I'm really sorry you guys.
Ross  Yeah. I'm sorry too. I'm even more sorry that that phone call didn't come before I told you about looking through the window.
Rachel  Yeah, we're gonna let you be alone.
Phoebe  (to Monica) You're gonna be okay?
Monica  Yeah, we'll be okay.
Ross  Love you guys. (he kisses Monica, he, Rachel and Phoebe leave.)
Joey  You know, I'm really sorry I wasn't more supportive before.
Chandler  That's okay, we understand.
Joey  And about this Nancy thing... If you're not sleeping with her, should I?
Monica  I know there'll be other houses, but it's just so... I love that one so much.
Chandler  Yeah... Well, it's a good thing we got it then.
Monica  What?
Chandler  We got the house.
Monica  Oh my God!
Chandler  I just didn't want to tell you in front of them.
Monica  Oh my God! My God! We've got the house !?
Chandler  We're getting the house. (they hug) We're getting the house.
Monica  And a baby...
Chandler  We're growing up.
Monica  We sure are.
Chandler  So who's gonna tell them?
Monica  (quickly) Not it!
Chandler  Not it! Damn it!
[Scene  Central Perk. The entire gang is there, and Chandler and Monica are handing out presents.]
Monica  Rachel, this is yours.
Rachel  Aah! Why? What are these for?
Chandler  You'll see.
Monica  All right, everybody open them!
Rachel  Ooh! Oh wow this is so beautiful. (she got a scarf)
Phoebe  Oh! These are the ones I was looking at in the store. (she got earrings)
Monica  I know.
Ross  I love this. (he got a sweater)
Joey  A meatball Sub? Thanks! (he got a meatball sandwich)
Ross  Seriously you guys, what's going on? What are these for?
Chandler  Well, I didn't know how to tell you before, but... We got the house.
Monica  Enjoy!
Joey  (speaking with his mouth full, enjoying his sandwich) What did they say?

[Scene  Central Perk. Everyone's sitting on the couch. Monica and Joey enter.]
Joey  Hey guys!
Monica  Hey, let me tell them!
Joey  Sure.
Monica  Joey is gonna be a celebrity guest on a game show!
Phoebe  Great!
Ross  Really? Which one?
Monica  (stopping Joey from answering) Ohh! Fish, seaweed, a sunken ship.
Ross  Things you find in the ocean, (to Joey) You're gonna be on "Pyramid"!!
Monica  Oh, that was our favourite game show ever!
Ross  Except for "Match game"...
Monica  Or "Win, Lose or Draw".
Chandler  What did I marry into?
Joey  Would you guys want to come down tomorrow and watch me tape the show?
Monica  Oh, I can't. We're throwing Phoebe a bachelorette party.
Phoebe  Yeah, sorry boys, this ride's closing.
Ross  Oh, and Chandler and I have this stupid college alumni thing. I can't believe you get to meet Donny Osmond.
Joey  Seriously?
Ross  (very excited) Yeah-uh!
Monica  Ross and I always wanted to be Donny and Marie.
Chandler  You guys just keep getting cooler and cooler!
Monica  Yeah, we used to perform for our family and friends.
Rachel  Oh God, that's right. I blocked that out.
Monica  (singing) "I'm a little bit country"...
Ross  (singing) "...and I'm a little bit rock 'n' roll"!
Chandler  (to Monica) I'm leaving you.
[Scene  Class of '91 reunion. Ross and Chandler enter.]
Ross  So weird to see all these people again... Oh my God, look, there's Geoffrey Cleric.
Chandler  Who?
Ross  He was roommates with John Rosoff. He went out with Andrea Tamburino. She dumped him for Michael Skloff.
Chandler  (looking around) Did I go to this school?
Ross  Hey, there's Missy Goldberg. You gotta remember her.
Chandler  (looks over at her) Sure, nice.
Ross  Dude. You're married to my sister.
Chandler  You're right, by saying "nice" I'm virtually licking her.
Ross  Hey, I hear she's single again, d'you think I should ask her out?
Chandler  Are you asking permission to break the pact?
Ross  Yes please.
Ross  Hey. Hey, check out the flyers for the band. I made 'em on a Macintosh in the computer room!
Chandler  Awesome, the name really stands out.
Ross  Thanks to a little something called "Helvetica Bold 24 point"!
Chandler  Man, we're gonna rock that Asian student union!
Missy  Hey guys!
Chandler  Hey!
Ross  Hey, Missy...
Chandler  You know, our band is playing on Friday.
Ross  Yeah, yeah. You should come check us out. We're called "Way! No Way!".
Missy  No way!
Chandler and Ross  Way!
Missy  Right. I'll be there. (she leaves)
Chandler  Fresh!
Ross  Boss!
Chandler  Mint!
Ross  She's gone.
Chandler  I know it. You know, I'm totally gonna ask her out.
Ross  Dude, I was gonna ask her out.
Chandler  I said it first, bro.
Ross  Well, I thought it first, Holmes.
Chandler  (angrily) Look, if you did...
Ross  Woha! Wait... What are we doing? What we have is too important to mess it up over some girl. I mean, we can get laid anytime we want.
Chandler  Totally. I had sex in High school...
Ross  Me too. I'm good at it.
Chandler  All right, I'd say we make a pact. Neither of us will go out with Missy Goldberg.
Ross  You got it.
Chandler  All right, so that's Missy Goldberg, Phoebe Cates and Molly Ringwald, who neither of us can go out with.
Ross  Those are the pacts!
Chandler  Oh, and Sheena Easton. But we probably couldn't get her anyway.
Ross  Oh, oh... maybe not you!
Chandler  Well, I officially give you permission to break the pact.
Ross  Thank you. (they shake hands) All right, here I go. Hey, remember how scary it used to be going up to girls in college?
Chandler  Your hands are shaking.
Ross  I know, and I can't stop sweating. (he walks towards Missy)
[Scene  The "Pyramid" Studio.]
Voice  Five! Four! Three! Applause!
Donny Osmond  Yeah! Welcome, it is Soap Opera week here on Pyramid, let's meet our contestants. First, Gene Lester is a database specialist, he's gonna be playing with "Days of Our Life's" star Joey Tribbiani! (Joey's amazed at the place and he keeps looking around till he realizes the audience is applauding him)
Joey  (to Gene) I know it could be intimidating for regular people to be around celebrities but... relax, I'm just like you! (pause) Only better looking and richer.
Donny  ...should be playing with the star of "General Hospital" Leslie Charleson. (applause) Welcome everybody. Good luck to all of you. Let's play Pyramid. All right? Now... we flipped a coin before the show, Gene, you won the toss, so you're gonna start. Which category would you like?
Gene  I'll take "You crossed the line".
Donny  You crossed the line. Joey, describe for Gene these things that have lines. Give me 20 seconds on the clock, please. Ready, go!
Joey  (on the screen there's the word "Supermarket") Uhm... ok. It's a store, like a supermarket. (there is a sound indicating he made a mistake as he shouldn't have said 'supermarket'. The next word appears, "notebook") Oh! I see-I see what I did. Yeah, ok, ok, uhm... I'm writing in my...
Gene  Diary.
Gene  Cafeteria.
Joey  Yeah! But that is not what they're looking for. (time's finished) OOOH!
[Scene  Monica's apartment, where Phoebe's bachelorette party is taking place.]
Phoebe  (to Rachel) Thank you so much for this.
Rachel  Oh, d'you like it?
Phoebe  Oh my God, it's all so elegant! When's the dirty stuff starting?
Rachel  What?
Phoebe  You know, the strippers, and the guys dancing, and you know, pee-pee's flying about.
Rachel  Pheebs, I... there isn't gonna be any flying about! We actually thought we were a little too mature for stuff like that.
Phoebe  Oh, ok. I see what you're doing, that's fine. This is all there is, just tea, uh, ok. (she drinks her tea) Hmmmm... raunchy!
Rachel  Seriously Pheebs, it's not gonna be that kind of a party.
Phoebe  Really? So this is... this is my big send off in the married life? Rachel this is the only bachelorette party I'm ever gonna have! I've got a big wad of ones in my purse! Really? I mean, really? It's just tea?
Rachel  Nooo! Phoebe, of course there is more! I mean, I'll just go and talk to Monica and get an ETA on the pee-pee's!
[Scene  Joey's at the game show "Pyramid" with host Donny Osmond.]
Donny  Now Gene I must remind you, you need all six of these to stay in the game, all right? Describe for Joey things you find in your refrigerator.
Joey  Ahaha, he might as well just give us the points.
Donny  Give me twenty seconds on the clock. Ready? Go!
Gene  You put this in your coffee.
Joey  A spoon. Your hands. Your face!
Gene  It's white!
Joey  Paper, snow, a ghost!
Gene  It's heavier then milk!
Joey  A rock, a dog, the earth.
Gene  Pass!
Gene  You put this on a sandwich.
Joey  Salami, anchovies, jam!
Gene  It's white!
Joey  Paper, snow, a ghost!
Gene  It's made from eggs!
Joey  Chickens?
Gene  Pass!
Joey  Oh!
Gene  You put this on a hamburger!
Joey  Ketchup!
Gene  Yes!
Joey  Relish!
Gene  Stop!
Joey  Oh.
Donny  Oh, time's up! Joey! You were, uh, almost on a roll there...
Joey  Yeah...
Donny  Uh, Gene, you're gonna have a chance to go to the winner circle in the second half. But right now Henrietta you are going to the winner circle to try your luck for ten thousand dollars, right after this, don't go away.
Stage Manager   And we're out!
Joey  Oh, so we didn't win, but it's fun to play the game, right?
Gene  Hey! I got a kid starting college. I've to get surgery on my knee, you just lost me ten grand!
Joey  Oh, wow! I'm so sorry, ok? I promise, we'll do better next time!
Gene  Well, I will, because I won't be playing with you.
Joey  Hey, you know, some of those are pretty hard! Like why would there be a ghost in my fridge? (pause). Yeah!
[Scene  College reunion party. Ross is talking to Missy.]
Ross  So, Saturday night!
Missy  I'd love to!
Ross  Great!
Missy  So how come it took you so long to ask me out?
Ross  Oh, well, uh, this is gonna sound kinda silly, but, do you remember my roommate Chandler Bing?
Missy  Sure, he was in your "band"? (she air quotes band)
Ross  It's been sixteen years but the air quotes still hurt.
Missy  Sorry.
Ross  That's ok. Uh, anyway, well he and I both really liked you a lot, uhm, but we didn't want anything to jeopardize our friendship, so we kinda made a pact, that neither of us could ask you out!
Missy  Really?
Ross  Yeah, why?
Missy  Well, Chandler and I used to make out! A lot!
Ross  You did?
Missy  Yeah. We'd go to the science lab after hours!
Ross  (angrily) AND ON MY TURF?
[Scene  Monica's apartment. The bachelorette party.]
Monica  (to Rachel) Hey, where is this guy, it's been over an hour!
Rachel  Well, he's coming from Jersey, he said he would get here as fast as he could!
Monica  Who is it?
Man  It's the police!
Rachel  (pretends to be shocked) Uh! The police!
Phoebe  (Excited, running back to her seat) Oh!
Man  That's right, it's officer Goodbody.
Monica  What's the matter, officer? Has someone been bad? (looks over to Phoebe and she opens the door, and to their dismay, the stripper is an old, short, fat guy who looks exhausted)
Roy, the male stripper  (coughs) Whoo, that's a lot of stairs!
Roy  Ooh, boy. You should warn people there's no elevator! I should not have had that Mexican food for lunch.
Monica  Are you gonna be ok, officer, uhm,...
Roy  Goodbody!
Monica  ...If-you-say-so.
Roy  So where's the young lady who I'm supposed to take (he shakes his hips) downtown! (Monica points Phoebe)
Phoebe  Oh, God!
Roy  All right, somebody show me where to plug in my box, and we'll get this party started! (he thrusts his pelvis towards Phoebe) Whaaaa... (walks back to plug in his cd player) Here? All right.
Phoebe  Rachel?
Rachel  Yeah?
Phoebe  Are you kidding?
Rachel  All right, look, we did not know that you wanted a stripper so we went to the phonebook and we got the first name we could find!
Phoebe  How old is your phonebook?
Monica  Oh my God, this man is gonna get naked in my apartment!
Phoebe  Oh God no, I don't wanna see him take his clothes off!
Roy  Are you talking about me?
Monica  Oh, no! I mean, obviously we want to see you take your clothes off! You big piece of eye candy!
Roy  Ok, ok, ladies! Can I have your attention, please? (pause) Did someone call for the long arm of the law? (He extends his arm from around his crotch and then upward and outward, towards Phoebe) I should warn you, I have a concealed weapon! (Puts his hands over his crotch) I hope you're familiar with the States penal code, ok, ok, enough teasing. Now for some pleasing!
Roy  Whoa, whoa, whoa (he turn off the music). She cringed!
Phoebe  This is how I look when I'm turned on!
Roy  You were talking about me before! Look, I don't need this! I'm outta here! Where's my hat? (goes to get it) Look, I've been in this business for a long time!
Phoebe  Shocking!
Roy  Now if you just pay me my three hundred dollars, I'll be on my way!
Phoebe  Three hundred dollars, are you kidding?
Rachel  No, that's ok, let's me just get my check book!
Phoebe  No, you're not gonna pay him, he didn't do anything!
Roy  Didn't do anything? I took a bus all the way from Hoboken. I climbed ... I dunno... like a billion stairs... It's not like I can take them two at a time!
Phoebe  I don't care. We're not paying you 300 dollars for this.
Roy  Well, look - it's not my fault if you're too uptight to appreciate the male form in all it's glory.
Phoebe  Oh yeah, okay. I'm uptight. Yeah, that's why I don't want to watch a middle aged guy dance around in what I can only assume is a child halloween costume! (turns to look at Monica and Rachel who look like they feel very sorry for the stripper)
Roy  I may have borrowed this from my nephew, but let me assure you, what's underneath (points at his groin)... is all man.
Phoebe  I'm sorry, did you say all man or old man?
Roy  (making a crying face) Oh, you're mean!
Monica  (walks towards Phoebe and the stripper) Uh, look, officer... uhm Sir...
Roy  Damnit. OH! (To Phoebe) Big surprise! The hunk of beef has feelings!
[Scene  At Pyramid. Joey is with the woman now.]
Donny  Ok Henrietta, you've picked Jack and Jill went up the hill.
Joey  (To Henrietta) My friend Rachel has a kid. I totally know nursery rhymes! (makes a thumbs up sign)
Donny  Joey describe these things associated with the United States congress. (Joey goes form looking very confident to looking very shocked the instant the word congress is said) Give me 20 seconds on the clock please. Ready? Go!
Henrietta  Uvula!
Donny  O-kay... Henrietta, you didn't get all the points you needed, so that means Gene, you are going to the winners circle to try for ten thousand dollars! (Gene is clapping his hands looking very happy and so is Joey) And you're gonna be going there with Joey Tribbiani (Both of their smiles fade away instantly)
[Scene  Class of '91 reunion. Ross is walking angrily towards Chandler, who is talking to two other guys.]
Ross  (To Chandler) You made out with Missy Goldberg. How could you do that, after you promised me?
Chandler  (to the two guys) Excuse me. (Chandler and Ross move away from them). That didn't make us sound gay at all!
Ross  You broke the pact!
Chandler  Ross, that was 16 years ago!
Ross  That doesn't matter! We're talking about the foundation of our friendship.
Chandler  I believe the foundation of our friendship was unfortunate hair. (Ross just stares at him) All right, look, if we're really gonna do this... it's not like you never broke one of the pacts.
Ross  I didn't.
Chandler  Oh really?
Ross  No.
Chandler  Oh really!?
Ross  NO!
Chandler  ADRIENNE TURNER!! (A girl behind them turns around)
Adrienne  Yes?
Chandler and Ross  Hey! Hey Adrienne. (They move away from her)
Ross  I never did anything with Adrienne Turner.
Chandler  Oh please, and you knew how much I liked her.
Ross  I don't know what... you're talking about.
Chandler  Really?
[Flashback scene  80's College party.]
Present Chandler's voice  Remember that big party? Freshman year? A week before Christmas vacation? I do. You had some visitors.
Monica  I can't believe we are at a real college party! (Rachel laughs excitedly) I have to pee so bad!
Rachel  This is so awesome! College guys are so cute!
Monica  Hey, you've got a boyfriend!
Rachel  I know. But if some guy who looks like Corey Haim wants to kiss me tonight, I'm sooo gonna let them! (They spot Chandler)
Monica  Look, there's Chandler. You knew, that stupid friend of Ross'. Said I'm fat. You know I've already lost 4 pounds!
Rachel  It... You can so totally tell.
Monica  I KNOW!
Rachel  Well lets see. Maybe he knows where Ross is. (They walk towards Chandler) Hey, how's it going (tries to look as un-interested in him as possible - checking out her nails).
Chandler  Aren't you...?
Rachel  Yeah, Rachel. And this (points to Monica) is Ross' sister, Monica. We met at Thanksgiving. (looks around the room as if searching for something more interesting to do).
Chandler  (smiling at Monica) Right. (to Rachel) So how're you doing?
Rachel  Bitchin'
Chandler  Hi Monica.
Monica  Hi Chandler. It's really nice to see you (rolls her eyes) NOT. (she and Rachel giggle a little and Chandler looks unimpressed)
Chandler  O-kay. I'll see if I can find Ross. (Goes off to find Ross.)
Monica  Oh my God Rach. Bean bag chairs.
Rachel  Oh.
Monica  Do NOT let me sit in one of those. We'll be here for days.
Ross  Listen Adrienne, you can't tell Chandler about this.
Adrienne  Oh believe me, Ross, I won't be telling anybody about this.
Ross  Cool! (They start kissing again and Chandler looks shocked)
[Scene  We cut back to the present. The reunion where Chandler and Ross are talking.]
Ross  I didn't know you knew about that.
Ross  (looks disappointed in himself) Man... I... I'm sorry.
Chandler  Look (hands him a drink) it was a lo-o-ong time ago.
Ross  So, eh. I made out with Adrienne and you made out with Missy. Well I guess we're even.
Chandler  (smiling a little nervously) Hmm mmmhm..
Ross  We are even, right?
Chandler  (sighs) Just one more thing. I was so pissed at you that night that I wanted to get back at you. So I thought, who does Ross like the more than anybody?
Ross  (thinks about it for a few seconds) What did you do to my mom?
Chandler  Not her!
[Flashback scene  We cut back to the 80's party. Rachel and Monica are "dancing".]
Rachel  I am sooo drunk.
Monica  That's weird. I've had the same number of beers as you and I don't feel anything at all. (Chandler approaches)
Chandler  Soo... you girls having fun?
Monica  For your information, ass munch, I've lost four pounds. Maybe even five with all the dancing. (A guy enters holding a pizza box)
Pizza guy  SOMEBODY ORDER A PIZZA?
Monica  Oh THATS ME! (she runs to the pizza guy)
Rachel  (finishing the last of her drink) I am soo not going to do good on my SATs tomorrow.
Chandler  Well maybe if you go to school here next year we can totally hang out.
Rachel  (sarcastic) Oh yeah. There is a plan! Why don't I just start taking my smart pills now?
Chandler  Well, maybe you can get in on a beauty scholarship.
Rachel  (blushing) Oh, what a line. (walks towards the drinks table with her back towards Chandler and whispers "Oh my God!")
Chandler  So where are you applying to?
Rachel  Oh well, You know, I think it's kinda really important that I go somewhere where there's sun, so I'm sort of... (Chandler leans in an kisses her) (She pulls away) Hey!
Chandler  I'm in college and I'm in a band.
Rachel  (She considers it for a second) Yeah okay. (She puts her hands around his neck and they start kissing again)
[Scene  Monica's apartment. The stripper is sitting at the kitchen table. Monica, Rachel and Phoebe are standing around him]
Roy  What's the matter? You never saw a 50 year old stripper cry before?
Phoebe  You know, it's fine. We'll pay you.
Roy  No, no, you're right. Who am I kidding? I should have hung up that breakaway jockstrap years ago. What am I gonna do? I mean, this has been my life for thirty two years. Taking my clothes off in front of people is all I know.
Rachel  No, wait. No there's gotta be something else that you can do. I mean, what skills do you have?
Roy  I don't know... I can make my pecs dance... I can pick up a dollar bill with my butt cheeks... I can go to that special place inside me where I feel no shame.
Rachel  So maybe something in an office.
Phoebe  Or you could teach stripping. You know, share your gift, pass the torch.
Roy  You know, actually that's not a bad idea. I can do it out of my apartment. I don't think my mom would mind.
Phoebe  There you go. Okay, do you think you're gonna be okay?
Roy  Yeah, yeah, yeah... This is so weird. I mean, you never know when it's gonna be your last dance. And I didn't even get a chance to finish it.
Phoebe  (after a pause) Finish it!
Roy  What?
Phoebe  Your last dance. Do it for us.
Roy  Really?
Rachel  (to Phoebe) Really?
Phoebe  Yeah, yeah. He deserves to do the thing he loves one last time.
Roy  Okay, all right... Get ready ladies!
Phoebe  Oh this is so ho-o-ot!
Phoebe  Oh no, no, no, don't stop!
Roy  (out of breath) Have to...
[Scene  The game show studio. Joey and Gene are sitting in the winner circle.]
Donny  Well, welcome to the Winner Circle. Joey and Gene, you guys ready?
Joey  (nervously) Yeah...
Gene  (irritable) Sure. (Joey gets even more nervous)
Donny  Okay. Give me sixty seconds on the clock please... Ready, GO! (runs off)
Gene  Oak, maple, elm, birch...
Joey  I-I-I don't know. Types of trees?
Gene  Uhm... Buenos días, enchilada, por favor...
Joey  (sympathetic) Oh, I'm so sorry. I don't know any Spanish words.
Gene  A match, a candle...
Joey  Things that go "tssst" when you put them out.
Gene  A torch, a bonfire... (Joey seems lost) uhm, your pee...
Joey  Things that burn.
Gene  "I'd like to go for a walk", uhm "scratch my belly".
Joey  Dude, dude! I think you're losing it.
Gene  Uhm, "I have fur", "I like to bark".
Joey  Oh, oh, oh... What a dog says.
Gene  Pepperoni...
Joey  (instantly) Pizza toppings, next!
Gene  Cindy Crawford, Christie Brinkley, Heidi Klum, Claudia Schiffer...
Joey  Oh, oh, oh... (5 seconds left)
Gene  Christie Turlington, Kate Moss...
Joey  Girls Chandler could never get?
Gene  (irritated) Supermodels!
Joey  Where? (looking around)
[Scene  Chandler and Monica's apartment. Monica's there and Ross and Chandler walk in.]
Ross  Hey, where's Rachel?
Monica  She and Phoebe took the stripper to the hospital.
Ross  Did you know Chandler kissed Rachel?
Monica  What? When was this?
Ross  Nineteen Eighty Seven. The weekend you guys visited me at school.
Monica  Oh my God! That's wild!
Chandler  Yeah, but it was like a million years ago, so it doesn't matter.
Ross  Well, it matters to me.
Chandler  Why?
Ross  Because... the night you kissed Rachel was the night I kissed Rachel for the very first time.
Chandler  You kissed her that night too?
Monica  Two guys in one night? Wow, I thought she became a slut after she got her nose fixed.
Chandler  Seriously, where did this happen?
Ross  Okay, after you told me she was passed out in our room, I went in there to make sure she was all right. She was lying on my bed, all buried in peoples coats. Well, I went to kiss her on the forehead, you know. But it was so dark, I accidentally got her lips. I started to pull away, but then I felt her start to kiss me back. It was only for a second, but... it was amazing. And now, now I find out that you kissed her first.
Chandler  Oh wait... What bed did you say she was on?
Ross  Mine.
Chandler  I'm pretty sure I put her on my bed.
Ross  No, she was definitely on my bed.
Chandler  Why would I kiss a girl, and then put her on your bed?
Ross  Well, then who was on my bed?
Monica  (screeching) OH! Oh, oh! (holding her hand in front of her mouth)
Ross  (realizing) NO! No, no!
Monica  YES! (Chandler gets an "oh no!" look on his face)
Ross  You were under the pile of coats?
Monica  I was the pile of coats!
Ross  OH MY GOD!
Monica  You were my Midnight Mystery Kisser?
Ross  You were my first kiss with Rachel?
Monica  You were my first kiss ever?
Chandler  What did I marry into?
[Scene  Back at the party in 1987. People are dancing to "Disco Inferno" by The Trammps.]
Monica  Oh, crap!

Phoebe  Oh, hey Joey.
Joey  Uh, hey.
Phoebe  Listen, I need to ask you something. Ok, you know how my step dad's in prison.
Joey  (afraid) Yeah.
Phoebe  Yeah. Well, uhm... listen he was supposed to get a weekend furlough, so he'd come to the wedding tomorrow, but he just called and... uhm... well, apparently stabbing Iceman in the exercise yard just couldn't wait till Monday.
Joey  So he can't come?
Phoebe  No, and so there's no one to walk me down the aisle and... well, I would just really love it if you would do it.
Joey  Seriously?
Phoebe  Yeah, you've... you know, sort of been like a dad to me. I mean, you've always, you know, looked out for me and shared your wisdom...
Joey  I am pretty wisdomous.
Phoebe  So... what do you say?
Joey  Are you kidding? Phoebe, I would be honored. (they hug)
Phoebe  Oh, thank you. I hope... I hope you know how much you mean to me.
Joey  (takes her hand) Listen, I hope... that you know... (has difficulty saying it) I don't want you to see your father cry, GO TO YOUR ROOM!
[Scene  Central Perk. Phoebe and Joey are sitting on the couch. A waitress brings a coffee and Phoebe wants to pay.]
Phoebe  Oh.
Joey  Oh no, no, no, let your dad get this.
Phoebe  (her mobile phone rings) Oh, it's my wedding planner. She's driving me crazy! (she answers) Hello... Hey, ok, stop screaming! Ok? So, halibut. All right, so salmon, either way. I don't-I don't... it doesn't matter to me!
Monica  (she enters with a headset on and she's speaking into the microphone) Well, it matters to me!
Phoebe  Well, I don't care, so you pick!
Monica  Did you just hung up on me? (she hangs up too) All right, look, I need you at the rehearsal dinner tonight at 1800 hours.
Phoebe  Uh-uh. Ok. What time is that.
Monica  You don't know military time?
Phoebe  Why, I must have been in missile training the day they taught that.
Monica  Just subtract twelve.
Phoebe  Ok, so... 1800 minus twelve is... one thousand, seven hundred and...
Monica  (screaming) Six o'clock!
Phoebe  Ok.
Monica  Ok. Hold on. (her mobile phone rings) Geller here! No! I said it has to be there by 4 o'clock. Goodbye. (she hangs up) Oh, how hard it is to make an ice sculpture?
Phoebe  Ice sculpture? That sounds really fancy! I told you I just want a simple wedding.
Monica  Please... honey, leave the details to me. Now I wanna make this day as special for you as I can. Now, ok, I was thinking that the harpist should wear white.
Phoebe  What harpist? My friend Marjorie is playing the steel drums.
Monica  Ooh... she backed out.
Phoebe  She did? Why?
Monica  I made her. (Phoebe looks shocked) Steel drums don't really say "elegant wedding". Nor does Marjorie's overwhelming scent.
Phoebe  (looking angry) Hey! She will shower when Tibet is free.
[Scene  The wedding rehearsal dinner.]
Chandler  Hey!
Phoebe  Hey!
Chandler  You look great. I'm so glad we're having this rehearsal dinner, you know, I so rarely get to practice my meals before I eat them.
Phoebe  Okay, what did we say was your one gift to us?
Chandler  No stupid jokes. I thought that was for the actual wedding.
Phoebe  Rehearse it!
Ross  Hi! (he kisses Phoebe)
Mike  Thanks for coming you guys.
Ross  Oh, (he goes towards Mike in order to shake hands but Mike hugs him) hey, oh... I... I was-I was going for a hand shake.
Mike  Is that why your hand is pressed against my crotch?
Ross  That is why!
Mike  Yeah.
Phoebe  So Rach.
Rachel  Yeah.
Phoebe  Where is Emma?
Rachel  Oh, Monica made me send her to my mother's. Apparently babies and weddings don't mix.
Monica  (coming) Are you still crying about your damn baby? Pheebs, you gotta keep the line moving, remember, 20 seconds per person. Your see these clowns all the time! (she takes off)
Joey  Hey, you're Mike's parents, right?
Mike's mother  Yes, we are.
Joey  Ah, our little ones are growing up fast, uh?
Mike's father  How's that?
Joey  You know, on the one hand you're happy for them, but on the other hand it's hard to let go.
Mike's father  Who in God's name are you?
Joey  Hey, I'm not that fond of you either, ok buddy? But I'm just trying to be nice for the kids!
Chandler  (to Rachel) You know what I just realized? We have no idea what we're doing in the wedding tomorrow.
Ross  Yeah, I thought we'd be groomsmen, but wouldn't they have asked us by now? When did they ask you to be their bridesmaid?
Rachel  Uh... November?
Ross  I wanna say it's not looking good.
Rachel  Hey Pheebs...
Phoebe  What's up?
Rachel  Uhm... you haven't told these guys what they're doing in the wedding yet.
Chandler  Heh.
Phoebe  Uhm... well, they're not in the wedding.
Ross  What? (Ross and Chandler don't know what to say, so there's an embarrassing long pause)
Rachel  Well, this is really awkward (staring at the floor) Oh, and I can leave!
Phoebe  I'm sorry you guys but, you know, Mike's got his brother and his friends from school so... you know, you were-you were... if it helps you, you were next in line, you just-you just missed the cut.
Ross  Oh, man!
Chandler  This is like figure skating team all over again. (Phoebe and Ross glare at him astonished) I mean synchronized swimming. (they continue to glare) I mean- I mean the balance beam. (to Ross) Help me!
Ross  FOOTBALL!
Chandler  Thank you.
Monica  (looking at Phoebe eating something) Pheebs, spit that out, that has pork in it.
Phoebe  Oh! I though the pot stickers were supposed to be vegetarian!
Monica  Yeah, I changed them. I-I sent you a fax about it!
Phoebe  I don't have a fax machine.
Monica  Ah, well then there are gonna be a few surprises!
Ross  I can't believe we're gonna be the only people that aren't in this wedding.
Chandler  I know, I hate being left out of things.
Ross  And it's a wedding! It'd be weird if I'm not in it...
Mike  Hey guys, how is it going?
Chandler  Fine. We're just sitting here. Alone. Doing nothing. It's our rehearsal for tomorrow.
Mike  Yeah look, about tomorrow, I... I've got a question for ya. I just found out that one of my groomsmen had had an emergency and can't make it.
Chandler  What happened?
Ross  Who cares, AND?
Mike  ...and I was wondering if... you know, maybe one of you guys... (Ross stands up)
Ross  I'll do it!
Chandler  (standing up too) M-Me-me-me!
Mike  You both wanna do it? Uhm... there's only room for one.
Chandler  Pick me, I look great in a tux and I will not steal focus.
Ross  No, Mike, no, no. You wanna pick me, I mean... watch! (he mimics the groommens way of walking down the aisle with a bridesmaid) Huh?
Mike  You know, I really don't feel very comfortable making this decision. You know, Phoebe knows you better, I'm gonna let her choose. (he leaves)
Ross  (to Chandler) Well, if Phoebe's choosing, then say hello to Mike's next groomsman.
Chandler  Oh, I will. But I will need a mirror... as he is me!
Ross  Please, you're going down!
Chandler  You are going downer!
Ross  Is that what they say on the Figure Skating Team?
Chandler  (almost crying) I wouldn't know, I didn't make it! (they hug)
[Scene  Wedding rehearsal dinner. Joey and Mike are talking.]
Joey  So, you know I'm filling in for Phoebe's step dad, tomorrow, right?
Mike  Yeah, yeah. Hey, thanks for doing that.
Joey  Oh, hey, my pleasure. (he suddenly becomes very serious) So what are your intentions with my Phoebe?
Mike  I intend to marry her.
Joey  Oh, a wiseacre. (Mike looks bewildered). No, no, no, I understand you plan to support your wife by playing the piano? Isn't that kind of unstable?
Mike  No more so than acting.
Joey  Strike two!
Mike  You're right. She probably will support me. Hey, unless we move in with you, dad?
Joey  Strike three! You only get one more, Mike!
Ross  So, what did you decide?
Phoebe  I decided to pee.
Chandler  Mike didn't tell you? You have to chose one of us to be in your wedding. One of his groomsmen fell out.
Phoebe  Oh no, no. I can't choose between you two! I love you both so much!
Chandler  Just not enough to put us in the original wedding party.
Phoebe  Oh, I don't wanna choose! It's (Rachel is walking by). Oh okay, wait. Rach! Listen I have a very special bridesmaid task for you today.
Rachel  (excited and clapping her hands in front of her face) Goody, what is it!
Phoebe  Well, there's a spot open for only one groomsman and you have to choose between Ross and Chandler. So good luck with that.
Rachel  What, what, what, no, I don't wanna do that.
Phoebe  All right, I guess I'll have to find a new bridesmaid.
Ross  I'll do it! (Monica approaches)
Monica  Ok, it's 2100 hours. (to Phoebe) Time for your toast. (Mike appears)
Mike  Do I have a minute to go to the bathroom?
Monica  You had a bathroom break at 2030. Pee on your own time, Mike! (to Phoebe and Mike). Now, in regard to the toast, okay, you wanna keep them short, nothing kills a rehearsal dinner like long speeches. Okay. You just get in, do your thing and get out!
Mike  Is that what you say to Chandler?
Monica  (very serious) It's 2101 and I am not amused. (pause). Ok, the bride and groom have a few words they'd like to say. (Everyone sits and Phoebe gets up)
Phoebe  Ok. Hello everyone and thank you all for being here tonight. So tomorrow's the big event and some of you might not know, but Mike and I didn't get off to the best start. (she reads a note). My friend Joey and I decided to fix each other up with friends so I, I... (Monica is twirling her hands in order to make Phoebe speed up her speech) oh I... hum... I gave it a lot of thought and I fixed him up with my friend Mary Ellen who couldn't be here tonight because... (Monica is tapping her watch with her finger) it's not important... she is in rehab. Anyway, so, ok, Joey said that he was fixing me up with his friend Mike, only he didn't have a friend Mike so he just brought, uhm, my Mike and, and (Monica clears her throat) but despite, you know... it got... it got good. Ok, I wanna take a moment to mention my mother, who couldn't be here...
Monica (rolling her eyes)  oh God.
Phoebe  And... moment's over! (Rachel, Joey and Chandler all turn and look disapprovingly towards Monica but she just shrugs it off) So, ok, uh, I can forget that. I can forget that and uhm... (she's flipping cards skipping half of them) Oh this is funny! Oh, but you need to know that to... that, to... Oh, ok, well, uhm, I (Monica is miming CUT). Ok, ok, I, ok, I.... MONICA I CAN'T DO IT LIKE THIS! THIS IS MY WEDDING! OKAY, I DON'T WANT THIS (she mimes Monica's when she was twirling her hands) OR THIS (she taps her watch) OR THIS (she mimes CUT) OK? I JUST WANTED A SIMPLE WEDDING! WHERE MY FIANCEE CAN GO TO THE BATHROOM ANYTIME HE WANTS! (pause) You know what? You're done.
Monica  What?
Phoebe  YOU'RE FIRED! (mimes the CUT again) (pause and she raises her glass) Cheers! (Chandler raises his, smiling and Monica stares at him and he puts down his glass.)
[Scene  Joey's apartment. Joey's having breakfast; Phoebe enters the room carrying her wedding dress.]
Phoebe  Hey!
Rachel  Happy wedding day!
Phoebe  Oh, happy my wedding day to you!
Rachel  Ok-dokey, Joey, listen. This is gonna be bridesmaid central, all right? We're gonna have hair and make-up going on in the bathroom and oh, I had to move a couple of things in the fridge to make room for the corsages.
Joey  Oh, man! I wouldn't have had breakfast if I knew there was going to be corsages!
Monica  Hi. About last night... I know you are under a lot of stress and even though the things you said hurt me a little bit... My point is, uh, well, I'm willing to take my job back.
Phoebe  Oh, well that's ok. I think you and I will do much better if you're just... here as a bridesmaid.
Monica  Oh, is that so? Ok. If that's really what you want, then here... I give you the headset. Well, I don't really want to give you the headset. Well I guess if you're taking over, you should probably return these messages. (hands her a stack of papers with messages and calls to return)
Phoebe  Wow, this is a lot!
Monica  Uh-huh, but I'm sure you can handle this. I mean, I have won awards for my organizational skills, but, uh, I'm sure you'll do fine.
Phoebe  You won awards?
Monica  Mm-mh. I printed them out on my computer.
Ross  Hey!
Monica  Hi.
Ross  Where's Rach?
Monica  She's in her room, why?
Ross  I have to talk to her about this groomsman situation, ok? I'm not gonna watch Chandler up there while I'm sitting in the seats like some chump! (he goes to Rachel's room, knocks the door and enters the room). (very fake gasp) Oh! My God! You're breathtaking!
Rachel  What d'you want?
Ross  You haven't by any chance chosen a groomsman yet, have you?
Rachel  Oh, Ross, c'mon, please! Don't make this harder than it already is!
Ross  I'm not! I'm making it easier! Pick me!
Rachel  Well, Chandler said that it's really important to him too!
Ross  Listen, listen. Whoever you pick is gonna walk down the aisle with you! Now, I promise I won't say a word, but if you pick Chandler he's gonna be whispering stupid jokes in your ear the whole time!
Rachel  Oh, you are the lesser of two evils!
Ross  (waving his fist in the air in triumph) YES, YES!
[Scene  Joey's apartment. Phoebe is talking at the phone, Monica is listening amused.]
Phoebe  Sven I don't understand what you're saying! What is wrong with the flowers? Lorkins? What the hell are lorkins?
Monica  I know.
Mike  Hey.
Phoebe  Listen, Mike, if you were Swedish and you were saying the word "lorkins" what flowers would that be?
Mike  (thinks a moment) Orchids?
Phoebe  Right there! That's why I'm marrying you!
Joey  (to Mike) Hello Michael.
Mike  Joseph.
Joey  May I have a word with you, please?
Mike  (looking around the room) This is... great...
Joey  Have a seat. (Mike sits on his bed, and Joey towers over him. He starts talking in an Italian godfather-type voice) Last night, I tried to welcome you into my family... and instead, you disrespect me... (shakes his head) I cannot allow this.
Mike  (not amused) Are you rehearsing for some really bad mafia movie?
Mike  Joey, I kinda have a lot to do today, what do you want?
Joey  I want you to take this seriously! Phoebe is very very important to me, ok? And I wanna make sure that you are gonna take care of her.
Mike  (gets up) Joe, I love Phoebe. She's the single most important thing in my life. I'd die before I let anything happen to her.
Joey  (very satisfied and smiling) That's what I wanted to hear! Because she's family, ok, and now you're gonna be family, and there is nothing more important in the whole world, than family.
Mike  That must have been one lousy movie.
Joey  (almost crying) That was ME!
[Scene  Monica and Chandler's apartment. Chandler is pacing and Rachel walks in.]
Rachel  Hi
Chandler  Hey, can I talk to you about this groomsman thing? If you pick Ross, he'll walk you down the isle just fine. But if you choose me, you'll be getting some comedy!
Rachel  Even so, I think I'm gonna pick Ross.
Chandler  Let me tell you why you need to pick me. (Goes to sit on the couch facing backwards to the kitchen. Rachel gets a chair and sits opposite him) See, when I was a kid, I was always left out of everything, you know, and it really made me feel... insecure. You know, I was always picked last in gym. Even behind that big fat exchange student who didn't even know the rules to baseball. I mean, this guy would strike out and then run to third. Anyway, If I'm the only one left out of this wedding, I just know that all those feelings are gonna come rushing back.
Rachel  All right fine, I pick you.
Chandler  (Getting up and raising his fist in victory) Y-Y-YEEESSS! Make "groom" for Chandler.
Rachel  (not amused by his pun but forcing a smile anyway) Oh my...
[Scene  Joey and Rachel's apartment. Phoebe is on the phone and Monica is nonchalantly "minding her own business".]
Phoebe  No! We're gonna do it my way. (listens) Because your way is stupid! Alright I gotta go, I have another call, Reverend. (switches calls) Hello?
Joey  I'm glad we had this little talk.
Mike  Yes. Yeah and thanks for all the wedding night advice. (walks away) That didn't make me uncomfortable at all! Alright, so I'll see everybody tonight?
Phoebe  Okay.
Monica  Bye.
Mike  Uhm, did you guys know that there is a giant ice sculpture in the hall?
Phoebe  Oh my God, what's it doing here?
Monica  (Obviously enjoying this setback) Ugh, I guess it got sent to the billing address as opposed to the shipping address. (by now she can barely keep herself from smiling) Uh! What a pickle.
Phoebe  (starting to panic) Oh my God, everything is such a mess. Why is this happening to me?
Joey  (staring at the ice sculpture) How bad do you want to stick your tongue on that? (They all glare at him)
[Scene  Central Perk. Ross is getting coffee at the counter. Chandler walks in.]
Chandler  How's it going?
Ross  (smiling to himself) Good. I'm just getting some coffee. So I'm alert for the wedding.
Chandler  (smiling to himself too) That's what I was doing too.
Ross  (barely containing himself at this point) Well, you have fun tonight.
Chandler  You too.
Ross  Oh, I will.
Chandler  Me too.
Ross  Wait a minute, I know why I'm being such an ass, why are you?
Chandler  I'm not supposed to tell you.
Ross  I'm not supposed to tell you!
Chandler  You told us both we could be in the wedding? (they both stare at Rachel)
Rachel  Well, in my defense, you were not supposed to tell each other.
Ross  Rachel, only one of us can do it, you have to choose. You and me together again. (he winks at her and Rachel looks disgusted)
Chandler  Rach, Rach, knock knock.
Rachel  Who's there?
Chandler  I'll tell you at the wedding.
Rachel  Uh.
Mike  Hey, I forgot my scarf.
Rachel  You know what, I can't do this. I don't know which one of you guys to pick.
Mike  Oh, you haven't picked yet. Oh good, 'cause I had an idea. I thought it would be fun if the third groomsman was my family dog. Chappy.
Ross  What? A dog? No! Rachel gets to choose.
Rachel  (sarcastic) Wow, this is a tough one. I think I'm gonna have to go with the dog.
Phoebe  Alright, wait, so what you're saying is that the chef is at the Hamilton Club, but the food is not and the drinks are there, but the bartender is not? Are you, are you FREAKING KIDDING ME!?
Monica  (enjoying what she's seeing) How's it going?
Phoebe  (to Monica) Help me.
Monica  What?
Phoebe  I want you to be Crazy Bitch again.
Monica  (Sounds moved) Really?
Phoebe  (Nearly in tears) Please?
Monica  You really want me to come back?
Phoebe  More than I wanna get married.
Monica  Ok people, we are back in business! (Gets her headset out of her purse) Oh God, we've missed you soo much! (takes all the notes from Phoebe) Ok, go and get your hair and make-up done, and I'll take care of everything.
Joey  Hey, what are you guys gonna do?
Phoebe  (sounds scared already) About what?
Joey  The blizzard. I just saw on the news, it's like the worst snow storm in 20 years! They already closed all the bridges and tunnels. (Opens the curtains to reveal a snow storm outside)
Monica  Ooh! But the band and the photographer are coming all the way in from New Jersey!
Joey  I don't think they are.
Ross  (to Rachel) Haha! Looks like you're not going to be in the wedding either. (Looks at Phoebe) So sorry Pheebs.
[Scene  Monica's apartment. They are all sitting around.]
Monica  (Putting down her phone) Well, the club lost it's power.
Joey  Yeah according to the news, most of the city did.
Rachel  Since when do you watch the news?
Joey  Uh, for your information, since they hired a very hot weather girl.
Ross  (To Phoebe and Mike) I can't believe you guys aren't going to be able to get married today.
Phoebe  I know.
Rachel  Wow, you know, it's so beautiful out there. You always wanted to get married outside. Why don't you guys just do it on the street?
Phoebe  What?
Rachel  Well, look, it's hardly snowing anymore. I mean you couldn't ask for a more romantic setting. This could be the simple wedding you've always wanted!
Phoebe  (Turning to Mike) What do you think?
Mike  I think I wanna get married to you today.
Phoebe  Me too! (turning to Monica) Monica, do you think we could do it?
Monica  (thinking) AFFIRMATIVE!
[Scene  Outside. They are a bunch of people arranging chairs, shoveling snow and making other preparations.]
Monica  (walking around with her headset still on) OK LET'S GET THESE CHAIRS OUT HERE! Gunther, hit the Christmas lights. (He does so and the lights above the chairs light up. Monica looks satisfied) Okay, who left the ice sculpture (picks up a piece of ice from the ground) ON THE STEAM GRATE? (nobody answers)
Mike's mom  Michael!
Mike  Hey! You made it. Great! Chappy! Hi! (kisses his dad) Hi! (kisses his mom) Mom, I know getting married in the street isn't something you approve of...
Mike's mom  No... It's lovely. The lights and the snow. I could look at them forever.
Mike's dad  (leans in towards Mike) I crushed a pill and put it in her drink... (to his wife) Come on, sweetheart.
Mike  (to Chandler and Ross) You know, Chappy's too small to handle all this snow. Someone's gonna have to walk him down the aisle.
Chandler  So technically, would this person be in the wedding?
Mike  I guess.
Chandler and Ross  I'll do it!
Ross  No, but Chandler, hello... Aren't you scared of dogs?
Chandler  I'm not scared. (moves towards Mike and Chappy) I'll just take little Chappy and... (he backs out) HE CAN SENSE MY FEAR. MY THROAT IS EXPOSED.
Ross  (takes Chappy from Mike) Well, I guess I'm in the wedding then. Ha haaa... (smells Chappy) He stinks!
Monica  Level 1 alert. I repeat, level 1. This is not a drill. Okay we've got a situation. The minister just called. He's snowed in. He can't make it.
Mike  Oh, no!
Joey  Oh hey, don't worry. I'm still ordained from your wedding.
Monica  Really?
Joey  Yeah, you'd think I'd give up being a minister and start paying to ride the subway? Huhuh...
Ross  Uhm, ministers don't ride the subway for free.
Joey  I had to read the Bible pretty carefully, but... yeah we do.
Monica  Okay, if Joey does the ceremony, then we have to find someone else to walk Phoebe down the isle.
Chandler  (quickly) I'll do it.
Ross  I'll...
Chandler  (to Ross) Na ha ha... (to Chappy) Ne he he... (Ross moves Chappy to Chandler, who quickly backs away) Ah ah...
Monica  Okay, Mike and Joey, get in position. Chandler, come with me. (they walk off, Ross looks down to Chappy, who he's holding and he gets a whiff of the dog's smell. He is clearly disgusted by it.)
Monica  Okay, Joey's doing the ceremony and Chandler's giving you away.
Phoebe  Oh, okay. Hi new dad. (Chandler waves)
Monica  So, you're ready to do this?
Phoebe  Uhuh, uhuh... Oh my God! This is really happening.
Rachel  Oh Phoebe, I'm so happy for you honey. (she gives her a kiss)
Phoebe  Oh, thank you.
Monica  I love you. (Phoebe leans in to kiss her.) Oh, wait, wait, wait! No hugs. The dresses... Oh what the hell. (the girls hug)
Phoebe  I love you guys.
Rachel and Monica  I love you.
Monica  Okay. (in her microphone) It's zero hour. All teams execute on my count. (to all) Let's get this bad boy on the road.
Chandler  (to Monica) Is it okay that I want you to wear that head set in bed tonight?
Monica  (checking her clipboard) I have you scheduled for nudity at 2300 hours.
Chandler  Oh yeah! (Monica walks outside)
Monica  Okay Marjorie, hit it.
Rachel  Geez Ross, you could have showered.
Ross  It's the dog.
Monica  Groomsman, groomsman, why are you just standing there, where is your bridesmaid? (into microphone) We've got a broken arrow. Bridesmaid down! (realizes) Oh, that's me.
Chandler  Ready?
Phoebe  (nervously) Okay.
Chandler  Okay.
Phoebe  Oh wait, oh no. Wait.
Chandler  Wow! Aren't you gonna be cold?
Phoebe  I don't care... I'll be my something blue.
Chandler  You look beautiful.
Phoebe  Thank you.
Mike  My God! Aren't you freezing?
Phoebe  Na-ah.
Joey  Friends, family, dog... Thank you all for being here to witness this blessed event. The cold has now spread to my special place... so I'm gonna do the short version of this. Phoebe and Mike are perfect for each other. And I know I speak for every one here... when I wish them a lifetime of happiness. Who has the rings?
Joey  (whispering to Phoebe) Okay...
Phoebe  When I was growing up, I didn't have a normal mom and dad, or a regular family like everybody else, and I always knew that something was missing. But now I'm standing here today, knowing that I have everything I'm ever gonna need... You are my family. (She puts the ring on Mikes finger)
Mike  Phoebe you're so beautiful. You're so kind, you're so generous. You're so wonderfully weird. Every day with you is an adventure, and I can't believe how lucky I am, and I can't wait to share my life with you forever. (He puts the ring on Phoebe's finger.)
Phoebe  Oh wait, oh I forgot... and uhm... I love you... and you have nice eyes.
Mike  I love you too.
Ross  Uh Joey...
Joey  Yeah?
Ross  Chappy's heart rate has slowed way down.
Joey  Oh, okay. Phoebe, do you take this man to be your husband?
Phoebe  I do.
Joey  Mike, do you take this woman to be your wife?
Mike  I do.
Joey  I now pronounce you... husband and wife.
Phoebe  I got married! (everyone applauds) Could someone get me a coat, I'm freaking freezing.
[Scene  The hallway between the two apartments. Chandler and Joey are walking up the stairs.]
Chandler  That really was an incredible wedding.
Joey  It was, yeah. I kind of don't want it to end. Hey, you wanna come in for a drink and a bite of corsage?
Chandler  I'd love to, but it's 2300 hours and I'm about to have the most organized sex anyone's ever had.
Joey  Nice. Oh hey, what about Ross?
Chandler  I don't know. Maybe he hooked up with that hot girl he was talking to.
Ross  Come on Chappy, do your business. MAKE! MA-AKE! I did not sign on for this.

[Scene  Central Perk. Everyone's sitting on the couch and Phoebe enters.]
Phoebe  Hi
All  Hey! Hi!
Rachel  How was the honeymoon?
Rachel  Oh!
Chandler  So, where's Mike?
Phoebe  Oh, he's at the doctor, he didn't poop the whole time we were there!
Joey  Well anyway, I'm glad you're back, I really need your help.
Phoebe  Oh, why? What's up?
Joey  I have an audition for this play and for some of it I have to speak French. Which, according to my résumé, I'm fluent in.
Ross  Joey, you shouldn't lie on your résumé.
Monica  Yeah, you really shouldn't. (to Ross, sarcastically) By the way, how was that year-long dig in Cairo?
Ross  (whispering) It was ok...
Rachel  I did not know you spoke French.
Phoebe  Oui, bien sur je parle Français! Qu'est-ce que tu penses alors?
Rachel  Oh... you're so sexy!
Joey  Well, so, will you help me? I really wanna be in this play.
Phoebe  Sure! Tout le plaisir est pour moi, mon ami.
Rachel  Seriously stop it, or I'm gonna jump on ya.
[Scene  Monica and Chandler's apartment.]
Chandler  Hey.
Monica  Hey.
Chandler  Why are you wearing my apron?
Monica  I'm making cookies for Erica. And oh, by the way, we have to leave for the airport soon, her plane comes in about an hour.
Chandler  Oh, hey, when she gets here, is it ok if I introduce you two as "my wife" and "the woman who's carrying my child"? (she's not amused) No? Divorce?
Ross  (he enters) Hey.
Monica  Hey.
Ross  You guys know where Rachel is?
Monica  No, we haven't seen her since this morning.
Ross  So unbelievable. She was supposed to meet me half an hour ago with Emma. (he tries to take a cookie but Monica slaps his hand)
Monica  Hey!
Ross  Hey!
Monica  These are for Erica!
Ross  What? She's gonna eat all those cookies?
Monica  Well, I want he baby to come out all cute and fat!
Ross  So, why is Erica coming to visit?
Monica  Well, because we want to get to know her better and she's never been to New York so she wants to see all the tourists' spots... you know, Statue of Liberty, Empire State Building...
Chandler  Oh, those places! There's always so many people, their being corralled like cattle, and... you know, there's always some idiot who goes "Mooooo"!
Monica  Well, if it annoys you so much, then why do you do it?
Ross  (looking at Rachel entering with Emma) Oh, hi! Hi! Thanks for showing you up thirty minutes late!
Rachel  Ross...
Ross  No, no, no, I'm sure you have a great excuse, wh-was it a hair appointment, a mani-pedi or was there a sale at Barney's?
Rachel  My father had an heart attack... (crying) ...while I was at Barney’s.
Ross  Oh my God.
Monica  Honey.
Chandler  I'm so sorry...
Ross  Is-is he ok?
Rachel  Yeah, they said he's gonna be fine, but he's still heavily sedated.
Ross  Ok, ok. I'm gonna come out to Long Island with you, I mean, you can't be alone right now.
Rachel  No, come on, I'm totally ok. (hugging him) I don't need you to come! I can totally handle this on my own.
Ross  Still-still, let me come... for me.
Rachel  Ok. If you really need to.
Ross  I bet someone could use one of Monica's freshly baked cookies.
Rachel  Oh, I really could.
Ross  Oh!
Rachel  Ohh... (Ross mouths HA-HA at Monica and takes two cookies and she looks at him angrily)
[Scene  Central Perk. Phoebe's trying to teach Joey French, so she's sitting in front of him with the script in her hands.]
Phoebe  All right, it seems pretty simple. Your first line is "My name is Claude", so, just repeat after me. "Je m'appelle Claude".
Joey  Je de coup Clow.
Phoebe  Well, just... let's try it again.
Joey  Ok.
Phoebe  Je m'appelle Claude.
Joey  Je depli mblue.
Phoebe  Uh. It's not... quite what I'm saying.
Joey  Really? It sounds exactly the same to me.
Phoebe  It does, really?
Joey  Yeah.
Phoebe  All right, let just try it again. Really listen.
Joey  Got it.
Phoebe  (slowly) Je m'appelle Claude.
Joey  Je te flouppe Fli.
Phoebe  Oh, mon Dieu!
Joey  Oh, de fuff!
Monica  (entering with Erica and Chandler) Hey you guys.
Phoebe  Hi!
Joey  Hey.
Monica  I want you to meet someone really special. Phoebe, this is Erica. And this is the baby!
Phoebe  Oh!
Monica  Joey. Erica, baby!
Joey  Hi.
Monica  Everyone. Erica, baby!
Chandler  Monica. Calm, self.
Erica  Thank you. It's really nice to meet you guys, I can't believe I'm here!
Joey  Welcome to New York City! Or should I say "ghe deu flooff New York City"?
Chandler  Why would you say that?
Phoebe  Ok. What are you gonna be doing today?
Erica  I wanna see everything! Times Square, Coney Island, Rockefeller Center...
Joey  Oh, you know what you should do? You should walk all the way at the top of Statue of Liberty.
Erica  Oh yeah, let's do that!
Chandler  Great! (to Monica) This baby'd better to be really good.

Rachel  (stopping a nurse who's coming out of a room) Oh, uhm, excuse me, I'm here to see my father. My name is Rachel Green.
Ross  And I'm Doctor Ross Geller.
Rachel  Ross, please, this is a hospital, ok? That actually means something here.
Rachel  Can somebody please go in?
Nurse  Absolutely.
Ross  Rach, I think I'm gonna wait out here, because my throat is feeling a little scratchy, I don't want to infect him.
Rachel  Ross, please, don't be so scared of him!
Ross  I'm not scared of him, I'm really sick!
Nurse  He's under sedation, so he's pretty much out.
Ross  I'm feeling better.
Rachel  Oh! (They enter. Rachel sees his father, lying on a bed, with tubes, drip and everything) Oh! Oh my God! Ohhh, ohhh, wow, that ear and nose hair trimmer I got him was just money down the drain, huh?
Nurse  Miss Green, your father's doctor is on the phone if you'd like to speak to him.
Rachel  Oh, great, Are you gonna be ok?
Ross  He's unconscious, I think we'll be just fine!
Rachel (leaving)  Ok.
Ross  Did the TV wake you?
Dr. Green  No, when you put your feet up in my bed, you tugged on my catheter.
Ross  Ouchy.
Dr. Green  What are you doing here, Geller?
Ross  Well, I came with Rachel, who should be back any second! (pause) So what's new?
Dr. Green  Ooh, I have a little heart attack.
Ross  Right, is it painful?
Dr. Green  What, the heart attack or sitting here talking to you?
Dr. Green  So what's new with you, uh, knocked up any more of my daughters lately?
Ross  Nope, just the one. RACH!
[Scene  Joey's apartment. Phoebe is trying to teach Joey French.]
Phoebe  Je m'appelle Claude.
Joey  Je do call blue!
Phoebe  Noooo! Ok, maybe if we just break it down. Ok, let's try at one syllable at a time. Ok? So repeat after me. "je".
Joey  je.
Phoebe  m'ap
Joey  mah
Phoebe  pelle
Joey  pel.
Phoebe  Great, ok faster! "je"
Joey  je.
Phoebe  m'ap
Joey  mah
Phoebe  pelle
Joey  pel.
Phoebe  Je m'appelle!
Joey  Me pooh pooh!
Phoebe  Ok, it's too hard, I can't teach you!
Joey  What are you doing?
Phoebe  I, I have to go before I put your head through a wall. (she leaves)
Joey  (he goes out calling her) Don't move! Don't go! I need you! My audition is tomorrow! Shah blue blah! Me lah peeh! Ombrah! (he gives up). Pooh.
[Scene  Green's mansion. Rachel's Room. Rachel's is combing her hair; Ross's coming into the room]
Ross  Hey!
Rachel  Hi!
Ross  I was gonna make us some dinner but all I found in your dad's fridge was bacon and heavy cream. (pause) I think we solved the mystery of the heart attack.
Rachel  Uh. (pause) Did you call your parents?
Ross  Oh, yeah. Emma's doing great.
Rachel  Oh good.
Ross  Wow.
Rachel  What?
Ross  Just can't believe I'm in Rachel Green's room.
Rachel  What do you mean? You've been in my room before!
Ross  Yeah, sure, right! Like I've ever been in Rachel Green's room.
Rachel  Ok I gotta tell ya, it's really weird when you use my whole name.
Ross  Sorry. (Rachel sits on her bed). You ok?
Rachel  Yeah.
Ross  You had a rough day, uh?
Rachel  Yeah, just so weird seeing him like that, you know? I mean he is a doctor, you don't expect doctors to get sick!
Ross  But we do! (pause) It's gonna be ok, Rach!
Rachel  (she's sad) Ow. I don't want him to wake up alone! I should go to the hospital!
Ross  What? No, no! Hey, hey, hey look...
Rachel  What?
Ross  They gave him a lot of medication, ok? He wouldn't even know if you were there. Look, we'll go see him first thing in the morning, ok?
Rachel  Really, I shouldn't feel guilty?
Ross  No, God! Hey, Rach, you've been an amazing daughter, ok? Right now you just need to get some rest.
Rachel  Ok, maybe you're right.
Ross  (he kisses her on her forehead) Good night.
Rachel  Wait, wait, wait, wait. Would you stay here with me for a little while?
Ross  Sure!
Rachel  Ok. (She sits on the bed and Ross sits near her) Thank you for coming with me today.
Ross  Oh, of course...
Rachel  Rachel Green is very happy you're in her room!
Ross  Me too. Come here. (They hug)
Rachel  I just don't want to be alone tonight.
Ross  Ok, well, uh, I can maybe grab a sleeping bag, or...(There's one of those moments. They're staring at each other, no word uttered, and then she leans toward him in order to kiss him, but he ducks and avoids her more than once.) Oh, oh. (he then hugs her and when she tries to kiss him again, he stands up and she falls down on the bed). No, Rach! I'm sorry, I just don't think this, this, this is a good idea.
Rachel  Wait, we won't know that until we do it, will we?
Ross  No, look, uh. You are upset about your father and you're feeling vulnerable and I just don't feel it would be right, I'd feel like I'd be, you know, taking advantage of you.
Rachel  Taking advantage? I'm giving you the advantage, enjoy!
Ross  Look, I'm sure it would be great, but I-I think one of us has to be thinking clearly, so, I'm gonna go!
Rachel  Wow. Ok.
Ross  I'll see you in the morning (he leaves).
Rachel  Mhm-mh!
Ross  (outside her room, talking by himself) Haven't had sex in four months, I should get a medal for that!
[Scene  Monica's apartment. Monica and Erica have just arrived.]
Erica  Thanks so much for taking me to all those places. I had a great time.
Monica  Oh, I'm glad. Listen, I want to apologize about Chandler, though. I just did not see this coming.
Chandler  (enters the room wearing an "I love New York" t-shirt, a "Statue of Liberty" hat and carrying bags) New York is awesome!
Monica  What is with you?
Chandler  Yeah, I've been to these places before, but I've never really seen them, you know.
Monica  Yeah, you miss alot, when you're moo-ing.
Erica  Thanks so much for showing me around.
Monica  Oh! It was our pleasure. We are so much enjoying getting to know you.
Erica  Well, if there is anything else you wanna know... (Monica and Chandler look at each other)
Chandler  Oh, uhm, okay, uhm, do you mind if we ask you some questions about the father?
Erica  Oh, sure. Yeah, well, he was my high school boyfriend. Captain of the football team, really cute and he got a scholarship and went off to college. (Monica and Chandler are smiling from ear to ear)
Chandler  That's great.
Erica  Yeah... it's almost definitely him. (Monica and Chandler look confused now)
Monica  How's that now?
Erica  Well, there is a chance it's another guy. I mean, I have only ever been with two guys, but they sorta overlapped.
Chandler  So, what does the other guy do? Does he go to college too?
Erica  No, he's in prison. (More shocked looks from Monica and Chandler)
Monica  Was he falsely accused of something? (They look hopeful)
Erica  No... he killed his father with a shovel. (Monica and Chandler's jaws drop) But other than that, he's a great guy.
Chandler  I'll bet his dad doesn't think so.
Monica  Are you awake?
Chandler  Of course I'm awake. Assume from now on that I'm always awake! (He turns the light on)
Monica  Alright, we don't know that it's him. I mean, it could be the football guy.
Chandler  Honey, it's us. Of course it's the shovel-killer.
Monica  Alright, lets say that it is him, would we not want the baby? No! Would we treat him any differently?
Chandler  I'd keep an eye on him! We have to find out which one the father is.
Monica  How?
Chandler  I dunno, aren't there tests for these things, right?
Monica  Yeah, but maybe we're just over-reacting.
Chandler  Pff, easy for you to say, he's a father killer. He probably loves him mommy. He's probably got a tattoo that says "mom" on his shovel-wielding arm!
[Scene  Joey's apartment. He is sitting on the barcalounger holding a French study book and listening to a French learning tape.]
Tape  We will now count from one to five. Un, deux, trois, quatre, cinq.
Joey  Huh, un, blu, bla, flu, flenk!
Tape  Good job.
Joey  Thank you.
Phoebe  Hey Joey.
Joey  Hey!
Phoebe  Listen, I feel really badly about yesterday and I thought about it a lot and, and I know, I was too impatient. SO lets try it again.
Joey  Oh, no, that's okay, I don't need your help. I worked on it myself and I gotta say, I am pretty good!
Phoebe  Really, can I hear some of it.
Joey  Sure, sure. Ok, (clears his throat and starts to read from his script. He starts talking in a fake French accent, making gestures with his hands) "Bleu de la bleu, de la blu bla bleu" (Phoebe looks astonished, annoyed and disgusted, Joey seems very proud though) See?
Phoebe  Well, you're not, (she tries to smile and contain her anger, but loses it) You're not... you're not... again, you're not SPEAKING FRENCH!
Joey  (offended) Oh well I think I am, yeah and I think I'm definitely gonna get the part.
Phoebe  How could you possibly think that?
Joey  For one thing, the guy on the tape said I was doing a good job!
[Scene  The hospital. Rachel is pouring her self a cup of coffee. Ross approaches from behind.]
Ross  Hey Rach, can you grab me a cup of coffee?
Rachel  (She turns around very slowly, looks at him for a second and then turns back to her coffee) Sure. (She gives him the cup she was pouring for herself without looking at him)
Ross  You've been quiet all morning. Is everything okay?
Rachel  Hmm-hmm. (starts to pour herself a cup of coffee, never looking at Ross)
Ross  You sure you're alright?
Rachel  (coldly) Yep.
Ross  (knowing she's not alright) O-kay. Well, I'm gonna go grab us some breakfast. (He starts to leave)
Rachel  FYI..
Ross  (knew this was coming) There it is... (he comes back)
Rachel  In the future, when a girl asks for some ill-advised sympathy sex... just do it. (she smiles fakely at him)
Ross  (half amused) Wait, wait, (looks around a little) You're mad at me about last night? I was just trying to do the right thing.
Rachel  (sarcastically) Really? Well, it seems to me if you'd done the right thing, I would not have woken up today feeling stupid and embarrassed, I would have woken up feeling comforted and satisfied!
Ross  (acknowledging the last part of her sentence) Well...
Rachel  Oh stop that!
Ross  I can't believe this. I was just being a good guy. I treated you with respect and understanding.
Rachel  (sarcastic) Oh, that is so hot. She walks around him to the other side)
Ross  Hey, I was looking out for you.
Rachel  Oh, really, well Ross, you know what? I am a big girl. I don't need someone telling me what is best for me.
Ross  I gotta say, I have not had sex a lot of times before, this is the worst ever.
Rachel  Oh, really, really? Well, it wasn't very good for me either. (She turns to leave and Ross over takes her and stands infront on her, his back to the row of doors leading to the hospital rooms)
Ross  Hey you know what? You know what? To avoid this little thing in the future, let's just say, you and me, never having sex again.
Rachel  What?
Ross  That's right, sex is off the table. (The door starts to open behind him and Dr. Green emerges) I am never having sex with you again. (Rachel stays quiet and after a few moments Ross realizes what has happened. He turns abruptly) Dr. Green, are you feeling better? (Rachel's dad glares at him with a deadly look)
[Scene  Monica and Chandler's apartment. Monica and Erica enter, Chandler is in the kitchen.]
Chandler  Hey! How was lunch?
Erica  (To Chandler) We had a good time. By the way, I wanted to ask you something. It would really mean a lot to me, if the baby was a boy, that you name him after my father, Jiminy Billy Bob (Monica smiles at Chandler and his he looks shocked and scared, getting no support from his wife)
Chandler  (struggling) Oh, really?
Erica  No! (To Monica) You we're right, that was fun! I'm gonna go finish packing.
Chandler  O-okay. (steps closer to Monica and speaks softly) So, is she gonna take the test?
Monica  Nope, she doesn't have to, I found out who the father is.
Chandler  Oh God. It's shovely-Joe, isn't it?
Monica  (smiling) No it's not.
Chandler  How do you know?
Erica  Well, it turns out that Erica didn't pay much attention in Sex Ed class, because the thing she did with that prison guy... it'd be pretty hard to make a baby that way.
Chandler  Oh God! What was it? The thing that we hardly ever do or the thing we never do?
Monica  The thing we never do.
Chandler  (nods in appreciation) Shovely Joe!
[Scene  The theatre where Joey is auditioning. Phoebe enters when Joey's on stage and she sits down. He hasn't seen her.]
Director  Whenever you're ready Joey.
Joey  Right. (clears his throat) Dja bu bu Claude. Uh, c'est la pu les la lu blah bloo.
Casting assistant  I'm sorry, what's going on?
Joey  Dude, come on! French it u-up!
Director  Joey, do you speak French?
Joey  Toutes la smore! Bu blu-ay bloo blah ooh! Pfoof!
Director  You know what. I think this audition is over. (Joey looks disappointed, but understands.)
Phoebe  (in a French accent) Uh, excuse me. Uh, I am Reginé Philange. I was passing by when I heard this man speaking the regional dialect of my French town of Estée Lauder.
Director  You really think this man is speaking French?
Joey  Sa-sa-saw!
Director  (to Joey) Good job, little buddy. That was some really good French. But I think we're gonna go with someone else for the part.
Joey  Ah. All right. But my French was good?
Director  It was great.
Joey  (to Phoebe) Oh-hoh! Ha-hah! See!
Joey  Yeah-hah. Toute-de-le-fruit.
[Scene  Joey and Rachel's apartment. Rachel is sitting at the kitchen counter and Ross enters from Rachel and Emma's room.]
Ross  Emma's down for the night.
Rachel  Oh, good.
Ross  So uh... I guess I wanna take off.
Rachel  Okay... Hey listen, just before you go I-I again, I just wanna say "thank you" for coming with me.
Ross  Oh, no problem.
Rachel  And also, you know I uh, I was thinking about what you said, you know, about the whole sex thing and... it's probably not a great idea to go down that road again.
Ross  Thank you. I'm glad you agree.
Rachel  It's a shame though, I mean, when we did it, it was pretty good.
Ross  Yeah... Yeah, that's true.
Rachel  Hey uhm, do you remember that one really great time...?
Ross  Oh, ye-ah!
Rachel  You know it was you're uhm... birthday...
Ross  ...Valentine's day...
Both  (long pause, they realize) Oh yeah!
Rachel  Well, I guess that's all in the past, now.
Ross  Hmmm-mmmm.
Rachel  (after a pause) Not even one more time?
Ross  Not even once.
Rachel  No matter how much we want it.
Ross  Even if we want it really bad.
Rachel  That's what we decided.
Ross  Uhm, right!
Rachel  ...It's kinda hard though!
Ross  Yeah.
Rachel  You know, when two people have a connection, you know, that's... just seems like such a... waste.
Ross  ...I hate waste.
Rachel  ...Ross?
Ross  Yes?
Rachel  Just so you know... With us... it's never off the table. (she enters her room and closes the door.)
Ross  Damn it. It's never off the table. (he leaves the apartment)
[Scene  Joey and Rachel's apartment. Phoebe and Joey are "updating" Joey's resumé.]
Phoebe  Okay, can you really tapdance?
Joey  No.
Phoebe  It's off the resumé. (she strikes it through with a pencil)
Phoebe  Archery?
Joey  No.
Phoebe  Horseback riding?
Joey  Would fall off a lot.
Phoebe  You can drink a gallon of milk in 10 seconds?
Joey  That I can do.
Phoebe  Come on! You can drink a gallon of milk in 10 seconds?
Joey  All right, watch me! (he takes a full container of milk from the fridge) Okay, you time me. Ready?
Phoebe  Ready... GO!
Phoebe  (checking her watch) You did it!
[Scene  Chandler and Monica's apartment. They are having a diner party with Phoebe and Mike.]
Mike  (raising his glass) Thank you guys for having us over.
Phoebe  Oh! Yeah, this is fun, couples night.
Chandler  Yeah, I don't know why we hang out with married couples more often.
Monica  Well, because every time we do, you make jokes about swinging and scare them away.
Chandler  You mean that Portuguese couple? Yeah, like you wouldn't have done it. (she shrugs)
Ross  (entering) Hey, you guys... I have great news.
Monica  Ross, we're kind of in the middle of diner here.
Ross  Oh, well, er, I already ate, but sure...! (they all look at each other when Ross grabs a plate) Guess what happened at work today...
Chandler  A dinosaur died a million years ago?
Ross  Try sixty-five million years ago, and then try sssshhhhhh.... My tenure review board met today and I hear it's looking really good.
Phoebe  Wow!
Ross  Yeah. Do you have any idea what this means in academic circles, uh? I am gonna get laid.
Rachel  (while entering) Hi you guys.
All  Hey.
Rachel  Ooh, Italian! (she also grabs a plate)
Monica  No one wanted seconds, right?
Ross  No, no. I-I'm good.
Rachel  Hey you guys... You're never gonna believe it. This headhunter called me. I have a meeting tomorrow with Gucci. Gucci wants me.
Ross  I'm up for tenure.
Rachel  Congratulations!
Ross  You too! What are the odds?
Rachel  Ooh! (they hug)
Joey  (enters) Guess what? (they all look expectantly at him) I finally got that seed out of my teeth.
Monica  I don't know who I'm happiest for...
Phoebe  I do, he's been working on that all day! (looking at Joey)
[Scene  Central Perk. Phoebe, Monica and Chandler on their couch.]
Phoebe  Hey Mon? Was it weird changing your name to Geller-Bing?
Monica  No, no. It felt nice to acknowledge this. (pats Chandler on his leg)
Phoebe  Where did you go to do it?
Monica  Uhm the... the ministry... of names... bureau...
Chandler  YOU NEVER DID IT!
Monica  I'm sorry. It's just the idea of being an official Bing.
Chandler  Hey! I will have you know that... aah, who am I kidding. Let's call the kid Geller and let Bing die with me.
Mike  (walks to the couch with coffee for Phoebe) Here you go.
Phoebe  Thanks! Honey, would you want me to take your name?
Mike  Oh, it's just... It's up to you. It's your name. You've got to live with it.
Phoebe  All right, let's see, call me mrs Hannigan.
Chandler  Mrs Hannigan?
Phoebe  What? Can't you see I'm in the middle of something? Ooh, I like it.
Joey  (enters) Hey guys.
Chandler  Hey Joe! We've got a couple of things we've got to check out at the new house. You want to come with us?
Joey  No, thank you.
Monica  All right. I know you're not happy about us moving, but you're the only one who hasn't seen the house.
Chandler  Yeah, come with us. You'll see how close it is to the city.
Joey  But no, it's not close. You said it was in escrow? I couldn't even find it on the map.
Monica  Joey, please come. It would mean so much to us.
Joey  You know what? You are my friends, I wanna be supportive, I will come with you. SHOTGUN!
Chandler  Damn it.
Monica  See you guys later.
Phoebe  Okay!
Monica  (to Joey) I'll pick you up at eleven. So glad you're coming.
Phoebe  Good for you. That was really mature.
Joey  What? No, the only reason  I'm going to their stupid new house, is so I can point out everything that's wrong with it, so they don't move. I'm gonna make them stay here.
Mike  You're a strange kind of grown-up.
Phoebe  Joey, you can't make someone do something they don't want to do. Believe me, there's something I've been trying to get Mike to do in bed and there's... he's just...
Mike  Woo-wo-hey-hey-hey... Can we not talk about that right now?
Phoebe  All right, prude... Look, Monica and Chandler really love this house. You are not gonna talk them into staying here.
Joey  Hey, hey... I can convince people to do anything, you know. I bet I can even get Mike to do that "thing". What is it?
Joey  I AM NOT GONNA HELP YOU DO THAT! Goodbye! (he leaves)
[Scene  A restaurant. Rachel enters.]
Rachel  (to maitre d') Hi, I'm here to see mr Campbell... with Gucci. The reservation is probably under Gucci. It's spelled like Gukki, which could be confusing.
Maitre d'  Mr Campbell's not here yet. Let me show you to his table.
Rachel  Oh my God! That's my boss. You have to seat us somewhere else.
Maitre d'  I'm sorry. That's always mr Campbell's table.
Rachel  But my... but my boss cannot see me. I'm interviewing for another job.
Maitre d'  I know. With Gukki
Rachel  Sssshhhh!
Mr Zellner  Rachel?
Rachel  Hi... I'm on a date...
Mr Zellner  (confused) That's great!
Rachel  Yeah, it is. Yeah, you know, it's tough. Single mom, career... You gotta get out there.
Mr Zellner  Well, you got uhm... good energy.
Rachel  Oh.
Mr Campbell  Rachel?
Rachel  Yes, hi!
Mr Campbell  James Campbell...
Rachel  Hi! (to mr Zellner) Excuse us.
Mr Campbell  Please... (shows her to sit)
Rachel  Okay. Oh, yeah... (whispering to mr Zellner) Oh he's cute!
Mr Campbell  So... your resumé is quite impressive. (Mr Zellner who sits behind Rachel shrugs)
Rachel  Wha... My resumé? I wouldn't... I wouldn't call my online dating profile a resumé.
Mr Campbell  Dating profile? I-I-I'm talking about the work resumé.
Rachel  (starts singing la la la la) Whatever happened to just singing for  no reason? Huh?
Mr Campbell  Maybe people... found it weird.... So, why do you want to leave Ralph Lauren?
Rachel  What? I-I don't.
Mr Campbell  You don't?
Rachel  No, I-I-I love it there.
Mr Campbell  Well, if you don't want to leave, why are we having this lunch?
Mr Campbell  What?
Mr Campbell  That's Hugo Boss?
[Scene  A  counter at a government building. Phoebe's waiting in line.]
Phoebe  (to the woman behind her) This place is so depressing. If I had to work here I'd kill myself. (she turns around and the clerk behind the counter heard her.) But you obviously haven't.
Clerk  How can I help you?
Phoebe  I need to change my name, please. See, I need to change it because I'm-I'm hiding from the law. (the clerk shows no change in expression whatsoever) You're fun.
Clerk  You need to fill out this form. (motions for the next person in line)
Phoebe  Okay, well, I just don't, I don't know how it works exactly. See, my name is Buffay and my husband's name is Hannigan, so is it supposed to be Buffay-Hannigan or Hannigan-Buffay?
Clerk  It can be anything you want.
Phoebe  Well, not anything, I mean...
Clerk  Yeah... anything.
Phoebe  Oh, this could take a while.
Clerk  Get out of my line.
Phoebe  Okay.
[Scene  Central Perk. Chandler and Monica are there when Phoebe enters.]
Phoebe  Hey!
Monica  Hey Pheebs.
Phoebe  Oh, not anymore. I changed it today.
Monica  Oh, I'm sorry, mrs Hannigan.
Phoebe  Wrong again! Apparently you can change it to anything you want. So I thought, all right, here's an opportunity to be creative. So meet Princess Consuela Banana Hammock.
Chandler  That's what we were gonna name the baby.
Monica  Phoebe!
Phoebe  Uh! Princess Consuela.
Monica  You seriously changed your name to that?
Phoebe  Uh-huh!
Monica  Okay, so from now on we have to call you Princess Consuela?
Phoebe  Uhm, no. I'm gonna have my friends call me Valerie.
Chandler  Hey, how'd the interview go?
Rachel  Oh! It's not good.
Chandler  You know, I always feel that way after an interview. I'll bet it went better than you think.
Rachel  Well, I didn't get the job at Gucci and I got fired from Ralph Lauren.
Chandler  That is a bad interview.
Phoebe  What are you, what are you talking about? How did this happen?
Rachel  Well, my boss was at the same restaurant where I was having my interview and he heard everything. So later he calls me to his office and he tells me that he's gonna have to let me go, because I'm not a team player. And I said "Wait a minute! Yes I am." and I had to sit there for 45 minutes while he proved that that in fact... was true.
Monica  Oh God. I'm so sorry.
Ross  Hey! Wha-hoo! What's this? (showing the bottle) Well it's a, it's a bottle of champagne. Why is this here?
Phoebe  Ross...
Ross  I guess it's here because I GOT TENURE!
All (except Rachel)  Congratulations! (Rachel looks devastated)
Ross  This is the single greatest day of my professional career. Gunther, six glasses!
Gunther  Six? You want me to join you?
Ross  Oh, I thought Joey was here. Five is good. (Gunther leaves, hurt) Well, I'm gonna have a loogie in my coffee tomorrow.
Chandler  Ooh! Israeli champagne. And it's vanilla!
Ross  I got tenure. I didn't win the lottery... Hey Rach, so uh... how did your thing go?
Rachel  Oh it... good! Yeah, but I'm not gonna hear from that for a couple of days.
Ross  Oh, you know what? You're gonna get it. I-I-I-I can feel it.
Phoebe  Can you?
Rachel  Ah, all right. Here's to Ross!
Ross  And-and to years of hard work finally paying off.
Phoebe  And to knowing that your career doesn't mean everything. (Rachel mouths "aah")
Ross  But also knowing it means a lot.
Monica  But more importantly to full well-rounded lives.
Ross  ...that center around work.
Chandler  To Ross!
All (except Rachel)  Ross!
Ross  You know what the best part about this is? I can never be fired.
Phoebe  Oh God!
Ross  No seriously. I have job security for life. You know, I never have to worry. (Rachel starts crying) Oh, look at you. Look  how happy you are for me.
Rachel  (crying) No, it's not that. I got fired today. And I didn't get the other job.
Ross  Rach, I'm so sorry.
Rachel  Oh!
Ross  Great. I feel like an idiot.
Rachel  No, it's okay, you didn't know.
Ross  Oh... (to the others) Little heads-up would have been nice.
[Scene  Chandler and Monica's future house. They enter the living room with the realtor and Joey.]
Monica  Thank you for letting us see the house again.
Chandler  And thank you for explaining to us what escrow means... I've already forgotten what you said, but thank you.
Realtor  Take as long as you want. Just let me know when you're through. (she leaves the room)
Monica  Ah, so glad you decided to come.
Joey  Me too. Yeah, this place is great. I'm so happy for you guys. Although, you know, I hope you like fungus.
Chandler  What?
Joey  Fungus! Yeah. Place is full of it.
Monica  No it's not. We had an inspection and they didn't find anything.
Joey  Okay. Then I guess I have dry eyes and a scratchy throat for no reason.
Monica  Maybe because it's you hung your head out of the window like a dog the whole ride here.
Joey  Maybe. So this is the living room huh? Ooh, it's pretty dark. (starts feeling around him like he's in a completely dark room, touching Chandler, who backs out and hits him)
Monica  No it's not!
Joey  (squinting his eyes) Are you kiddin'? I think I just saw a bat in the corner!
Chandler  When your head was hanging out the window, it didn't hit a mailbox, did it?
Joey  (glares at him for a moment, then admits grudgingly) Maybe. Well, I just think you guys can do better than this house, you know? Or any other house for that matter.
Monica  Oh Joey, look, we know you're having a hard time with this, but we really, we love it here.
Joey  FINE, ok, if you love this house so much, then you should just live here, okay? I just hope you get used to that weird humming sound. (He turns his back to them and starts humming) Hmmmmmmmmmmmmmm...
Monica  Joey, we know that's you.
Joey  no... hmmmmm... it's not... hmmmmmmmmmm
[Scene  Phoebe is at Central Perk. Mike enters.]
Mike  Hey (He kisses Phoebe)
Phoebe  Welcome back!
Mike  Ah! I missed you
Phoebe  Oh, me too!
Mike  So, what's new?
Phoebe  Well, I'm no longer Phoebe Buffay.
Mike  That's great! You changed you name?
Mike  (afraid) You're kidding right?
Phoebe  Nope.
Mike  You really did that?
Phoebe  Yep.
Mike  Yeah, but you can't do that.
Phoebe  Why? It's fun, it's different, no-one else has a name like it.
Mike  (looks at her astonished) Alright, then I'm gonna change my name.
Phoebe  Great, okay, what are you gonna change it to?
Mike  Crap Bag.
Phoebe (not amused) Mike Crap Bag?
Mike  No, no Mike, just Crap Bag. First name Crap, last name Bag.
Phoebe  You're not serious, right?
Mike  Yeah, I'm serious. (sarcastic) It's fun, it's different and no-one else has a name like that!
Phoebe  Uhu, uhu, well, then, great. If you love it, I love it.
Mike  I do love it, and I love your name. I love Princess Consuela.
Phoebe  And I love Crap.
[Scene  Joey is in Monica and Chandler's future house, sitting in a child's bedroom, looking at a quiz card which has "5+10=" printed on one side.]
Joey  (turns the card around, obviously had the wrong answer) Ow!
Girl  Who are you?
Joey  Oh, hi, I'm Joey. My stupid friends are buying this house. Who are you?
Girl  I'm Mackenzie. My stupid parents are selling this house.
Joey  (understanding) Oh.
Mackenzie  (sighs) I hate my parents.
Joey  I hate my friends. (They shake on it as if they just made a pact) Alright, look. There's gotta be a way that we can stop this from happening.
Mackenzie  Like what?
Joey  (thinking) Uhm... oh! Okay. You come with me, and you tell them that the house is haunted!
Mackenzie  What are you? Eight?
Joey  Woah, uh! Okay, let's hear your great idea.
Mackenzie  I don't have any great ideas. I am eight.
Joey  (frustrated) Ahh! There's gotta be a way. I mean, you know, if Monica and Chandler move out here and now Phoebe is married to Mike. That just leaves me and Ross and Rach, you know what I mean?
Mackenzie  I really don't.
Joey  What am I gonna do, I feel like I'm losing my friends.
Mackenzie  My parents say I'm gonna make new friends.
Joey  Oh, yeah, sure, easy for you, you're young. Me, I'm set in my ways.
Mackenzie  This is what my mom was talking about. Whiners are wieners. (Joey glares at her angrily) Look, you want your friends to be happy, right?
Joey  Yeah, yeah, I guess.
Mackenzie  Well, if moving here is gonna make them happy, don't you want them to do it?
Joey  (having difficulty admitting it) Yeah, maybe.
Mackenzie  Then you gotta let them go.
Joey  (In near tears, realizes she is right) I hate to admit it, but you're probably right. How did you get to be so smart?
Mackenzie  I read a lot.
Joey  (his mood changes instantly) Just when I thought we could be friends. (he leaves the room)
[Scene  Outside Ralph Lauren building. Rachel just walked out carrying a box of her stuff, and a strange man approaches her.]
Man  Hey Rach, I just heard. I'm so sorry.
Rachel  Oh, thank you... (looks at his face trying to remember his name)
Man  You still don't know my name, do you?
Rachel  (Is embarrassed for a moment, but it quickly passes) Well, now I don't have to. (The man leaves instantly)
Rachel  (annoyed) Ross, what is taking you so long?
Ross  (stares at her through the door and starts pushing the chair harder, looking very annoyed. He finally manages) (sarcastic) I'm sorry, it's almost as if this wasn't built for a quick getaway!
Mark  Rachel?
Rachel  (turns around) Mark? Oh my God! (puts the box on the chair and they hug each other)
Mark  How've you been?
Rachel  I'm fantastic. You remember Ross?
Mark  Sure, sure. (To Ross) What's with the chair. (Rachel signals him not to mention she's been fired)
Ross  Uh, you know, you can't always get a seat on the subway, so... (laughs stupidly)
Mark  Clever. (back to Rachel) So how are you?
Rachel  Oh, well, (looks at her box and chair) you're not catching me on my best day.
Mark  Yeah, a box full of your desk stuff doesn't exactly say big promotion.
Rachel  No, but it's good, you know, I'm gonna take some time off and do some charity work.
Mark  Are you sure, because we may have something at Louis Vuitton.
Rachel  Well, screw charity work. What've you got?
Mark  Why don't we have dinner tonight and talk about it?
Rachel  Great! I'll call ya!
Mark  (shakes Ross' hand) Nice to see you.
Ross  Yeah! yeah, I got tenure! (Mark looks at him strangely and walks off)
Rachel  (very excited) Oh my God!
Ross  See? I told you something good would come along. And he seemed really nice. I've met him before?
Rachel  Ross! That's Mark. From Bloomingdales? You were insanely jealous of him.
Ross  (realizing) That is Mark?
Rachel  Yes.
Ross  I hate that guy.
Rachel  Oh.
Ross  No, no, NO, you cannot go to dinner with him.
Rachel  What? You don't want me to get a job?
Ross  Oh yeah, I'm sure he's gonna give you a job. Maybe make you his SEXretary.
Rachel  Ugh.
Ross  I'm serious. I just don't trust that guy, okay?
Rachel  Ross, you know what? (looks over to the door and sees security staring at them) Okay, let's talk about it later, there comes security. (Takes her box and leaves. Ross follows her and then returns for the chair. He stands for a moment, then pushes it quickly in the general direction Rachel went into, and out of the camera's view, and then nonchalantly walks away)
[Scene  Chandler and Monica's new house. Sitting near the window, they look at the neighborhood.]
Monica  Oh, I love this street. The trees, the big front yards, the actual picket fences.
Chandler  Man, those two dogs are going at it!
Joey  (entering) Hey!
Chandler  Hey.
Monica  Hey, where have you been?
Joey  Oh, just er... you know, looking around. But you know what? This house... is great.
Chandler  Really? What changed your mind?
Joey  Oh well, the little girl who lives here made me feel a lot better about the whole thing.
Chandler  Joey, there was a little girl who lived here, but she died like 30 years ago.
Joey  (frightened) What?
Chandler  Ha! I'm just messing with you.
Joey  That's not funny! You know I'm afraid of little girl ghosts!
Monica  Joey, now that you're okay with the house, do you wanna go see your room?
Joey  What? I get my own room?
Chandler  You don't think we'd buy a house and not have a Joey room do you?
Joey  Oh my God! (they all hug) Oh! Hey, can I have an aquarium? And a sex swing?
Chandler and Monica  No!
Joey  Why not? I'll keep the tank clean.
[Scene  Central Perk. Phoebe and Mike are leaving.]
Mike  After you, miss Banana Hammock.
Phoebe  Thank you, mister Bag.
Woman  Oh hey, how are you?
Phoebe  Oh hi Rita! Good! (to Mike) Oh, Rita's a massage client.
Mike  Oh! Why don't you introduce me?
Phoebe  (shrugs) Er, Rita, this is my husband.
Rita  Oh! (they shake hands)
Phoebe  Yeah.
Mike  Why don't you tell her my name?
Phoebe  (without moving her lips, wearing a fake smile) Okay, I will. (to Rita) This is my husband Crap Bag.
Rita  Crap Bag?
Mike  If you need an easy way to remember it, just think of a bag of crap.
Rita  Okay. Excuse me...
Phoebe  Yeah... Ogh... Okay, fine. You made your point. Can you please just be Mike Hannigan again?
Mike  Only if you'll be Phoebe Buffay.
Phoebe  How about uhm... How about Buffay-Hannigan?
Mike  Really?
Phoebe  Yeah. I'm Phoebe Buffay-Hannigan Banana Hammock.
Mike  Do you even know what a banana hammock is?
Phoebe  It's a funny word.
Mike  It's a Speedo.
Phoebe  ...Oh crap!
[Scene  Monica and Chandler's apartment. Ross enters.]
Ross  Hey, is Rachel here?
Monica  No.
Ross  She's still at dinner?
Monica  I guess. Why? Who's she with?
Ross  That guy Mark. From Bloomingdale's... She thinks he's just being nice to her. But I know he really wants to sleep with her.
Chandler  It's seven years ago. (he looks surprised) My time machine works!
Ross  We ran into him on the street today and he said he might have a job for her. But I know he just wants to get into her pants.
Monica  So what if he wants to sleep with her? I mean, she's single and he's cute.
Chandler  Excuse me?
Monica  Oh please! Yesterday on the subway? You couldn't stop staring at that woman with the big breasts the whole time.
Chandler  For your information, I was staring at her baby. We're about to be parents.
Monica  Oh, sorry!
Rachel  (entering) Hi you guys!
Ross  Hey, so uhm... How was dinner?
Rachel  Oh, it was great. Mark is so sweet.
Ross  (speaking without pause, agitated) Oh yeah? Yeah? I wonder why? What could that smarmy letch possibly want?
Rachel  Oh Ross, come on. He's happily married. His wife just had twins.
Ross  Should we send something?
Chandler  How did the job stuff go?
Rachel  He offered me one.
Chandler  That's great!
Ross  Congratulations!
Rachel  I know, it's amazing. It's amazing. It's so much better than what I had at Ralph Lauren. The money is great...
Ross  Can we, can we just stop for a second? Who said something better would come along, huh? You didn't believe me. I told you everything was gonna work out. (gasps) You know what? This calls for a bottle of Israels finest.
Rachel  The job is in Paris. (they all stare at each other)
[Scene  Joey and Rachel's. Joey's on the phone.]
Joey  I mean, this soap opera is a great gig, but... am I missing opportunities? You know, I've always thought of myself as a serious actor. I mean, should I be trying to do more independent movies?
Mackenzie  (at the other end of the line) I don't know... You know what? I'm gonna put you on with my bear. Hold on. (she puts the phone at the bears ear)
Joey  Hey bear, I need some career advice.
Jennifer  Previously on Friends...
Chandler  How did the job stuff go?
Rachel  He offered me one.
Ross  (gasps) You know what? This calls for a bottle of Israels finest.
Rachel  The job is in Paris. (we see Ross stare in disbelief)
Rachel  Oh, God! Please, somebody  say something.
Ross  So if you take this job you'll be moving to Paris?
Chandler  Or facing a bitch of a commute.
Rachel  I know, it's huge, and it's scary, and it's... really far, far away 
  from you guys, but this is such an incredible opportunity for me. And I've already 
  talked to them about our situation with Emma, and they said they'll do whatever 
  we need to make us feel comfortable.
Ross  Okay.
Rachel  I mean, I'll fly back and forth, they'll fly you out... 
  Anything we want.
Chandler  My boss said I might be getting a new lamp in my cubicle. (Monica 
  looks at him and can't really place what he just said)
Ross  All right, we'll work it out.
Rachel  Thank you! Thank you!
Ross  Yeah, yeah! (they hug) You sure this is what you want?
Rachel  I think it is. (Ross looks very sad. Phoebe 
  and Joey enter.)
Phoebe  Ooh, what's going on?
Rachel  I got a really incredible job offer.
Joey  Hey, great! All right!
Phoebe  Good for you!
Rachel  It's in Paris.
Joey  What? No, no, no! No, no... no... no, no... No, too much is changing, 
  okay? First, Phoebe getting married (to Phoebe) Congratulations! (pointing to 
  Monica and Chandler)... and then these two move into a stupid house in the stupid 
  suburbs...
Monica  Hey, this afternoon you said you'd be supportive...
Joey  Well, it comes and goes. I wouldn't trust it.
Rachel  Look, you guys... this is really, really important to me. And it means 
  a lot if you could try to get on board.
Phoebe  Of course we can. Congratulations. (they hug, but Joey shakes his head.) 
  Yay! (she gestures Joey to come and join in) Joey...
Joey  No, no, no. My hugs are reserved for people STAYING IN AMERICA.
Rachel  (walking towards Joey) Joey, it would mean so...
Joey  Hey! No! Get your France-going-arms away from me. (He walks out, and 
  Rachel follows him)
Rachel  Joey...
Phoebe  You okay with this?
Chandler  Well, it makes me feel sad, but...
Phoebe  Talking to Ross.
Chandler  I see.
Ross  Well, Rachel moving to another country? Not being able to see her every 
  day. How can I be okay with this?
Monica  I know, but what are we gonna do? She really needs this job.
Ross  Do you think if the Ralph Lauren people offered her her old job back, 
  she would take it?
Monica  How is that gonna happen?
Chandler  Is this the best way to use one of your three magic wishes?
Ross  I don't know. I could talk to her boss. Yeah! I met him at that Christmas 
  party. We really hit it off.
Monica  You mean the guy who kept calling you Ron?
Ross  I didn't say we were brothers.
[Scene  Central Perk. Phoebe's reading a newspaper. Chandler 
  and Monica walk in.]
Monica  Hey Phoebe. Hey, tell me what you think. All right. The house next 
  door to the one that we're buying in Westchester? Just went on the market. I wanna 
  take a look at it, but Chandler doesn't.
Chandler  We close escrow tomorrow, so seeing another house can only confuse 
  us, and we're easily confused. We're not very bright.
Monica  But what if it is better than ours? Should we at least look?
Chandler  What do you think Pheebs?
Phoebe  Well, I think that shirt makes you look like you should work at a Baskin 
  Robbins... Anyway... Hey, isn't Joey's agent Estelle Leonard?
Chandler  Yeah.
Phoebe  She died.
Chandler  You're kidding!
Monica  That's terrible!
Phoebe  Yeah, last Saturday. Wow! She was the first black man to fly solo across 
  the Atlantic. (Chandler and Monica look puzzled) Oh, wait a minute, I read the 
  wrong one.
Chandler  Oh yeah?
Phoebe  Yeah, she was just an agent.
Monica  Joey's gonna be *so* upset.
Chandler  I know. *He* always wanted to be the first black man to cross the 
  Atlantic.
Phoebe  Well, we cannot tell Joey about this. He's already flipping out about 
  everything that's changing. This will push him over the edge.
Monica  Seriously, you don't think we should tell him?
Phoebe  Well, not for a little while. Let's just give him a few days to get 
  used to everything else.
Monica  What if he reads it in the paper?
Chandler  Unless Snoopy says it to Charlie Brown, I think we're okay.
[Scene  Ralph Lauren. Mr Zelner's office. Ross knocks on the 
  door and enters.]
Ross  Yeah, I'm a friend of Rachel Green's. Uhm, actually we met at the Christmas 
  party about two years ago.
Mr Zelner  Oh right, uhm, Don?
Ross  Close. Ron. (shakes hands)
Mr Zelner  Uh... What can I do for you?
Ross  Uhm, well... I'm here to see if you'll give Rachel her job back.
Mr Zelner  Ah, did she ask you to come here and do this?
Ross  Oh, no. At first I have to get you to agree. Then we'll 
  see if she wants to come back.
Mr Zelner  Wow, that is tempting.
Mr Zelner  She is good!
Ross  (surprised) Huh, I took a shot there.
Mr Zelner  But I'm sorry. There's nothing I can do... Ah, 
  it's not true, there is... nothing I want to do.
Ross  I see... Thanks very much. (he gets up and walks to the door. On his 
  way out he looks at the photographs Mr Zelner has near his door. He picks one 
  up.) Is this your son?
Mr Zelner  Yeah, his name is Ross. (Ross looks very surprised) What?
Ross  Oh, nothing, it’s just, it’s close to Ron. Does he.. Does 
  little Ross like dinosaurs by any chance?
Mr Zelner  Yeah, they're all he talks about, why?
Ross  How would he like to come with me to the Museum of Natural History after 
  everyone else has left, just the two of us, and he can touch anything he wants. 
  (Mr. Zellner looks shocked). I just heard it as you must have heard it and that’s 
  not good. Let me start again. I’m a paleontologist, you’ll be there 
  with us and the touching refers only to bones… fossils!
Mr Zelner  You can really arrange that?
Ross  You let Rachel come back, and it’s done.
Mr Zelner  Well, I guess having Rachel back wouldn’t be the worst thing 
  in the world.
Ross  Yeah! Yes! Thank you! This is great. Thank you so much. And I swear, 
  your kid is going to have the time of his life.
Mr Zelner  That’s great. I worry about little Ross. He’s always 
  reading, he's collecting rocks and he’s obsessed with dinosaurs.
Ross  He’ll be fine.
[Scene  Central Perk. Phoebe’s reading, Joey has just entered 
  the room]
Joey  Hey Phoebe.
Phoebe  Hey. Everything ok?
Joey  I’m just mad at my agent.
Phoebe  Estelle? Why?
Joey  There’s a part in a TV movie that I would be perfect for and I 
  didn’t even be put up for it! She’d better have a good reason.
Phoebe  I’m guessing she does.
Joey  Well (taking his cell phone out of a pocket) I’m wanna hear it, 
  because she keeps doing this.
Phoebe  Well, no, no, wait, wait, wait. All right, I gotta go. Just listen. Promise me, that you 
  will wait a minute before you call her.
Joey  Ok. Why?
Phoebe  Because a promise between friends means never having to give a reason. 
  (she leaves)
Joey  I love that saying!
Joey  Hello?
Phoebe (doing Estelle)  Joey, it’s Estelle.
Joey  I was just gonna call you! That’s weird.
Phoebe-Estelle  It’s a little coincidental, but believable. 
  (Joey nods in agreement). Listen, I’m sure you’re wondering why 
  I didn’t get you an audition for that TV movie.
Joey  Yeah, actually I am!
Phoebe-Estelle  I guess I dropped the ball there. Whoopsie!
Joey  That’s it? You know, it seems all you do lately is drop the ball.
Phoebe-Estelle  Don’t take that tone with me. Who you 
  think you are? Alan Lemond, the first black man to fly solo across the Atlantic?
Joey  No, no, look. All I’m saying is that you’re my agent, ok? 
  And you’re not getting me into any auditions and I’m tired of it.
Phoebe-Estelle  What are you saying?
Joey  I’m saying that… (pause). This isn't  working for me 
  anymore, ok? Estelle, you’re fired. Goodbye. (he hangs up the phone).
Phoebe  Man, tough week for Estelle!
[Scene  Joey’s apartment. Rachel’s there and Ross 
  enters the room with a stuffed dinosaur]
Ross  Hi.
Rachel  Hi.
Ross  Emma left her stuffed t-rex at my house. You know she can’t sleep 
  without it.
Rachel  Oh, well, she’s asleep now. Stop forcing that thing on her.
Ross  Ok.
Rachel  Oh, you’re not gonna believe what happened to me today! Ralph 
  Lauren called, and gave me my job back!
Ross  Nooo!
Rachel  Yee. I mean, it was so weirdest thing. They fired me and then out 
  of nowhere they just hire me back! I mean, that place must have been falling 
  apart without me.
Ross  So, you’re not going to Paris.
Rachel  No, I’m still going.
Ross  Wh… wh…what?
Rachel  When the Louis Vuitton people found out that Ralph Lauren wanted me back, 
  the offered me more money! Isn’t that great?
Ross  Yeeeah! (They high-five)
[Scene  house next to the one the Bings are moving into. Chandler 
  and Monica knock, a lady opens the door.]
Lady  Oh, sure. I’m showing it to someone else right now, 
  but please, look around.
Monica  Thanks.
Chandler  It feels like we’re cheating on our house. 
  And if we’re gonna cheat, shouldn’t it be with like a hot, younger house, 
  that does stuff that our house won’t do?
Monica  Ours is so much better! This living room is smaller, the dining room looks 
  like a cave! What a hole!
Lady  So? What do you think?
Monica  Love it!
Lady  Well, we already have one offer on it, and I think the lady 
  upstairs is goning to make another one.
Monica  They could be our neighbors, what are they like?
Lady  Oh, the woman upstairs is very nice. She and her husband have two kids, 
  he's on Wall Street and she…
Janice  Oh my God!
Chandler (to Monica)  Sure.
[Scene  Joey’s apartment. He’s there and Phoebe comes 
  in.]
Phoebe  Hey Joey, want come with me to… are you ok?
Joey  Yeah, I just… I just feel bad about firing Estelle. This is got to be 
  killing her.
Phoebe  No, that wouldn’t kill her. Ordinary embolism might.
Joey  I don’t know. She’s got to be taking it hard, I was like 
  her only client. Except for this guy who eats paper. And I’m guessing 
  he eats more money than he makes. Look, I know she’s not a great agent, but 
  she did stick with me for ten years. I’m gonna call her and hire her again.
Phoebe  No, no, no! Don't call her! You wait for her to call 
  you (Joey considers it)
Joey  Why?
Phoebe  Because patience is the road to understanding (she thinks) which ... 
  is the key... to a happy heart.
Joey  (impressed) You blow me away.
Phoebe  (picking up her bag) All right, so promise you're gonna wait for her 
  to call you?
Joey  I promise. And that means, never having to give a reason. (Phoebe stops 
  herself from laughing and leaves)
[Scene  The house Monica and Chandler are viewing. Janice comes 
  down the stairs.]
Chandler  And yet I never run into Beyonce!
Realtor  You two know each other?
Janice  Oh, we go way back. Before Monica made an honest man 
  out of him, Chandler used to be my little love muffin! (does her irritating 
  laugh). So? Are you guys thinking of getting this house too? Ooh! Are we gonna 
  have a bidding war? I'd better warn you, I'm a toughie (playfully punches Chandler, 
  who tries to get away from her)
Chandler  (at Janice's punching) Don't, don't! (looks disgusted)
Monica  No, actually, we're buying the house next door. (Janice gasps)
Chandler  (To Monica and with bulging eyes) Why!?
Monica  (looks confused and scared) I don't know 
  why.
Janice  Ooh, that decides it then. I was on the fence. 
  But knowing that you two would be our neighbors? Ah! now we have to 
  get it! (Chandler and Monica are utterly shocked) Ellen, we're going to talk 
  numbers. (Grabs Ellen by her elbow and pulls her outside)
Chandler  This can not be happening!
Monica  Okay, the realtor said another couple made an offer. 
  Maybe the Janice's won't get it! Maybe the other couple will.
Chandler  The only way that that is going to happen, is if the other couple 
  are the Hitlers.
Monica  (Thinks a little more) Okay, Okay, (clapping her hands) 
  All right. What if we got both houses? Huh? We can turn this house 
  into a guest house.
Chandler  That is a great idea! And by the way, I don't mean to sound distasteful, 
  but when did you start crapping money!?
Monica  Okay, you come up with an idea.
Chandler  Alright alright, we still have three hours till escrow closes on 
  our house. We can still get out.
Monica  But we love our house.
Chandler  Will we love it so much with her next door? And she's gonna be louder 
  out here too. Just the crickets and (apes Janice's voice) "Oh My God"!
Monica  Okay, but if we don't get this house, she's stil gonna show up wherever 
  we go! I mean, at least if she's here, it eliminates the element of suprise. 
  I mean, never again will you have to hear the three words that make your balls 
  jump back up inside your body. (She shows this with her index finger, mimicking 
  it pushing something up)
Chandler  (looks afraid, but at the same time, knows she's right) Well, we 
  have to do something. We can't have her living next door. (Janice's laughs loudly 
  outside) Oh, that does it too. (Motions with his index finger like Monica did)
[Scene  Mr. Zellner's office. There is a knock on the door.]
r Zelner  Who is it?
Ross  (enters) It's me. Ron. (Mr. Zellner looks annoyed) 
  Look, I um, I now Rachel turned you down but I think there is a way you might 
  be able to get her to come back.
Mr Zelner  This may surprise you, but re-hiring fired employees, 
  is not my main job.
Ross  Just hear me out. How would you feel about offering her a raise? (looks 
  hopeful)
Mr Zelner  (obviously amused) Not good, Ron.
Ross  Perhaps I can persuade you. What if you can give your son this (Takes 
  a huge egg out of his back) genuine pterodactyl egg (whispers) replica.
Mr Zelner  (Takes a long look at the egg while he considers it) Wow, that's 
  pretty cool (Takes the egg from Ross)
Ross  Huh? So? We have a deal?
Mr Zelner  Okay, you got it.
Ross  Yes! yes!
Mr Zelner  This is gonna make me very popular.
Ross  Oh, (grins) Believe me, the ladies, they love it!
Mr Zelner  (looks at Ross, for a long moment, confused) I meant with my son.
Ross  Good, 'cause the ladies, not so much. (shakes his head, give him a thumbs 
  up and leaves)
[Scene  Joey's apartment. He walks in reading his mail, and plays 
  back his messages on the answering machine]
Joey  Oh my God. (Still in shock when his mobile rings, he picks it up) Hello?
Phoebe  (on the other side of the line, still pretending to be Estelle) Joey, 
  it's Estelle. (Joey's eyes bulge up, he looks afraid)
Joey  Estelle?
Phoebe  Yeah, I wanted to call and tell you that there's no hard feelings for 
  firing me.
Joey  (still scared) Ok-ay. I just, I can't believe you're calling me?
Phoebe  Well, I didn't think I should just drop by...
Joey  No, no, no! (Starts looking around the room, terrified) Don't drop by, 
  don't drop by!
Phoebe  Anyway, you did what you had to do. I'm okay.
Joey  Can I ask you something? Uhm, what's it like there?
Phoebe  (Looks around) It's alright. Look kiddo, I gotta go. Good luck with 
  the career. You're gonna be huge.
Joey  Thanks for everything Estelle. Bye. (Hangs up and reads the phone display) 
  "out of area". Boy, I'll say.
[Scene  The house next door to Chandler and Monica's new house. 
  Chandler is pacing worriedly through the living room when Janice enters.]
Chandler  The Hitlers will be so disappointed.
Janice  All right, I got to run. Tell Monica I say goodbye. And... I'll see 
  you later, neighbor. (Janice laugh)
Chandler  Wait! I just want you to know that... I'm so happy you're going to 
  be here.
Janice  Oh, me too... (laughs)
Chandler  Because... that way... we can pick up where we left off.
Janice  Huh?
Chandler  I never stopped loving you.
Janice  Oh... my...
Chandler  Yeah, yeah, yeah! I want you... I need you... I must have you Janice 
  Litman Goralnik Neihosenstein.
Janice  Chandler, what are you talking about?
Chandler  Now that you live next door, we can be together every day. Sid and 
  Monica never have to know a thing.
Janice  I don't know what to say... I mean, you know, obviously we have this... 
  heat between us.
Chandler  (stunned) Obviously.
Janice  But I love my husband. And I know you love your wife. Now, I don't 
  think we should get this house now.
Chandler  Don't say that. Don't tangle the dream and take it away.
Janice  Chandler, one of us has got to be strong.
Chandler  I understand.
Janice  Although, maybe just... one last moment of weakness... (she kisses 
  Chandler flat on the mouth. Chandler squirms. When she's finished, he looks 
  at her lovingly but uneasily.) Goodbye Chandler Bing. (She leaves)
Chandler  (speaking as in pain) They're never coming down now.
[Scene  Ross's apartment. Ross is working on his laptop when 
  Rachel enters with Emma.]
Rachel  Hi!
Ross  Hey!
Rachel  You are never going to believe what happened to me today.
Ross  What?
Rachel  Ralph Lauren called again and they offered 
  me more money.
Ross  They did?
Rachel  Yeah. It was the weirdest thing. Zelner called me and he said we'll 
  do everything we can to get you back. And that I should thank some Ron... I 
  don't even know what department that guy's in.
Ross  So, what are you gonna do?
Rachel  Well, I took it.
Ross  That's great! So you're staying in New York!
Both  YAY! WHOO! YAY!
Ross  You're excited, right?
Rachel  (hesitant) Ye-ah. Yeah! You know, the money's great. 
  It's certainly the easier choice...
Ross  Right!
Rachel  Yeah, you know, was I looking forward to going to 
  Paris? Sure. You know, was I excited about working in the fashion capital 
  of the world? Ooh, absolutely... Oh...! Yeah, but you know, this is... it's 
  fine. I'm fine going back to a job where I've pretty much gotten everything out of 
  that I possibly can... (she sits down, and Ross who is stunned to hear all this 
  follows her example)
Ross  Uhm, I hadn't no you... I had no idea you were so excited about Paris. 
  Uhm, I mean, you said you were scared.
Rachel  Well yeah, but I mean, it was good scared though, you know? Like when 
  I-moved-to-New-York scared. Or uhm, when I-found-out-I-was-gonna-have-Emma scared... 
  But this is... fine. This is gonna be good. (they both stare around)
Ross  (after a long pause) You should go.
Rachel  What?
Ross  It's what you want. You should go.
Rachel  You really think so?
Ross  I really do.
Rachel  But I already told Zelner that I would come back...
Ross  (picks up a skull of some carnivore from his side table and puts it in 
  the same bag in which he brought the pterodactyl egg to Zelner) I'm sure he'll 
  understand.
Rachel  All right. ALL RIGHT! I'm gonna do it. I'm gonna go to Paris.
Ross  Yeah...
Rachel  Yeah! I'm going to Paris. Thank you, Ross!
Ross  Yeah, yeah, oh! (They hug)
Rachel  Oh! Oh, I'm so happy.
Ross  Then I'm happy too. (They're still hugging - fade out)
[Scene  Estelle's memorial service. Joey is giving a speech. 
  Next to him is a blown op photograph of Estelle behind her desk and there's 
  a man standing next to him.]
Joey  Thank you all for coming. We're here today to pay respects 
  to a wonderful agent and a beautiful woman... (Joey looks at the photograph) 
  ..inside. As Estelle's only two clients we would like to say a few words. (Joey 
  looks for his notes. The man next to him is chewing something.) Dude, where's 
  my speech? (the man swallows something and looks at Joey.) That is 
  entertaining. Al Zebooker everybody. (he applauds and Al shows that there's 
  nothing left in his mouth.)
[Scene  Joey's place. Rachel and Joey are talking]
Joey  All right, all right, all right, let's play one more time, ok? And remember, if I win you do not move to Paris.
Rachel  Ok! Can't believe I'm risking  this again, but you're on! All right Joe, you remember the rules! Heads I win, tails you lose.
Joey  Just flip!
Rachel (she flips the coin)  Ha, tails!
Joey  Damnit!
Chandler  Hey!
Joey  Hey!
Chandler  So we thought we'd throw you little going away party around seven.
Rachel  Oh, that sounds good!
Monica  Hey, Rach, you're leaving tomorrow, shouldn't you be packing?
Rachel  It's all done!
Monica  Oh, yeah, right! And after I took a shower this morning I just threw my towel on the floor! Oh God, it hurts to even joke about it.
Rachel  I know... Honey, seriously, I did it all. The luggage that I'm taking is in the bedroom, this is Emma's Paris stuff, these are the boxes that I'm having shipped, and that's the sandwich that I made for the plane...
Monica  Ok,  so you've done some good work! (pause) What about your carry-ons?
Rachel  Oh, well. Everything that I need (she takes her bag) is in here and my travel documents are on the counter organized in the order that I will be needing them.
Monica  Oh my God! I have nothing left to teach you! (they hug)
Chandler  Where's your passport?
Rachel  It should be right next to my plane ticket.
Chandler  Well, it's not.
Rachel  What? Maybe I put it in here (she opens her bag). Oh, oh, it's not in there! Oh, no! I must have packed it in one of these boxes!
Monica  Here, let me help you. (they both start opening boxes)
Rachel  Shoot. Oh, I can't believe I did this!
Chandler (to Joey)  At what point did it stop being funny that I took her passport?
[Scene  Monica's apartment. Monica and Erica are talking about the baby, and Monica is rubbing Erica's tummy.]
Monica  Oh, wow, can you believe you're like three weeks away?
Erica  I know.
Monica  You don't mind me touching your belly, do you?
Erica  No, I don't mind you touching my belly, but right now your hand is kind of blocking the part where the baby is gonna come out.
Ross  Hey!
Erica  Hi.
Ross  Hey Erica, welcome back to town! (pause) Wow, look how big you've gotten.
Erica  That's because I'm pregnant!
Ross  Right, no, I understand.
Erica  Oh, ok.  I'm just always afraid that people think I'm just fat with big breasts.
Ross  No, no, I knew (he stares at her breasts).
Monica (to Ross)  Okay, well, stop staring at them.
Ross  She brought them up! (pause) I didn't realize you were coming back so soon!
Erica  Hey, well, in a couple of weeks I won't be able to travel.
Monica  Yeah, and I wanted her to get to know the doctors and get settled into the hotel.
Ross  Hotel? Why isn't she staying with you guys?
Monica  Because we're moving in a couple of days and it just didn't make sense.
Erica  Plus hotels are fun! My room has this little fridge full of free snacks!
Ross  Erica, those things aren't free. In fact they have one of the highest mark-ups of any consumer product...
Monica  Ross! She's giving us her baby. She can eat you if she wants.
Erica (standing up)  I'll be right back.
Ross  Oh man, I can't believe you guys are leaving this place.
Monica  Oh, I know. I know. Hey, you know, you can take it if you want! The lease is still in Nana's name.
Ross  No, no. This will always be your place. It would be too sad. Plus, how much a month does it cost  to feed Joey?
Monica  Yeah, it takes two incomes.
Ross  Hey, is Chandler here? We talked about catching a movie.
Monica  Oh, no. He doesn't have time for that. But if you want, you can go help him and Joey pack up the guest room.
Ross  Mhm, (he balance things) packing - sexy cheerleader comedy.
Monica  Mhm, helpful brother - creepy loner at teen movie.
[Scene  Guest room. Joey has his head wrapped in bubbled wrap and Chandler is punching him. Ross enters the room.]
Ross  What are you guys doing?
Joey  Try it, I can't feel a thing! (Ross starts punching him too)
Monica (enters the room)  Are, are you kidding? This is packing?
Chandler  We're taking a break!
Monica  From?
Chandler  Jumping on the bed?
Monica  All right, Rachel's party is in a couple of hours and there's a lot to do. Now, Ross, you got Geller blood, you're in charge of these yahoos!
Ross  You got it! (Monica leaves, Ross closes the door). All right, she's right, we gotta get serious. (He grabs a bag of styrofoam peanuts) Let's put styrofoam peanuts down his pants and kick him!
Chandler  No, no, no, guys. She's right. We should get to work. I'll take stuff out of the closet, Joey you pack 'em and Ross you re-pack whatever Joey packs.
Joey  You guys hear a ringing?
Chandler  (holding a pair of furry handcuffs) What the hell is this?
Joey  Hey! Handcuffs! And fur line, nice! I didn't know you guys had it in ya!
Ross  Chandler, you don't have a sister so you can't understand how much this bums me out.
Chandler  I didn't know Monica had these!
Joey  Mhm, maybe she used them with another boyfriend. Maybe Richard!
Chandler  Why would she use them with Richard and not me? I can be kinky! I once did a naked dance for her... with scarves!
Ross  Bumming hard, guys, bumming hard.
[Scene  Monica's apartment. Phoebe and Ross enter the room.]
Phoebe  Hey!
Monica  Hey! Where's Mike?
Phoebe  Oh, he has a gig. I kinda like being married to a rock star, you know. My husband has a gig.
Ross  Yeah? Yeah, where is it?
Phoebe  Oh, he's playing organ for a children's roller-skating party.
Ross  Rock on!
Phoebe (watching the food on the table)  Wow, this is quite a spread! (pause) What is all this stuff?
Joey  (entering the room) Hey.
Chandler  Hey.
Ross  Hey, where's Rach?
Joey  Oh, she's putting Emma down, she'll be over in a second.
Ross  Great.
Joey  Now it just hit her that she's leaving and she's kind of emotional so no one say anything to set her off, ok?
Monica  Yeah.
Everybody  Hey Rach, hey you.
Ross  Here she is!
Rachel (crying)  Hi you guys!
Joey  What did I just say?
Rachel  No, no, no. It's ok. I'm gonna be fine.
Monica  Come here, I'll make you a drink.
Ross  Oh, man! I can't believe she's actually leaving. How am I gonna say goodbye to Rachel?
Chandler  I know, she's been such a big part of my life. And it feels like when Melrose Place got cancelled. (Ross and Joey looks puzzled) I mean... oh, forget it. I miss Melrose Place!
Joey (to Ross)  You know, I had a chance to stop her too!
Ross  Yeah?
Joey  Who loses fifty seven coin tosses in a row? Head she wins, tails I lose. (he stops and starts realizing something) Wait a minute...
Chandler  Yes, Joe?
Joey  I forgot to pick up my dry cleaning!
Phoebe (to Rachel)  You doing ok?
Rachel  Well, I've been better.
Phoebe  Uh-hmm.
Rachel  You guys are gonna come and visit me, right?
Phoebe  Yes! You know, in six months the Statute of Limitations runs out and I can travel internationally again!
Rachel  I'm gonna miss you so much.
Phoebe  I know.
Rachel  You know what? Uhm, I have some goodbye stuff that I wanted to say to each of you and I was gonna save it until the end of the night, but come here (they go into the guest room).
Ross  Hey, what do you think they're doing in there?
Joey  Huh, if I had to  guess I'd say Rachel is putting on the bubble wrap and Phoebe is doing the punching.
[Scene  Guest room. Rachel and Phoebe are sitting on the bed.]
Rachel  Oh, Pheebs, I don't even know where to start.
Phoebe  Ok well, before you do, I know we weren't supposed to get you going away presents,  (she takes something out from her pocket) but I do have something for you.
Rachel  Oh, oh. (she's holding the present, a transparent bag with a white stick in it). What is this?
Phoebe  It's a cotton swab with a bit of my saliva on it, so that if they perfect the cloning process while you are over there, you can use the DNA to create your own Pheebs!
Rachel  I'm gonna throw this away, but thank you so much for the gesture!
[Scene  Monica's apartment. The living room.]
Monica  Chandler? I was just in our bedroom and I found these (she holds the furry handcuffs) on my pillow.
Chandler  Oh, yes. I decided to leave these out for you in case Richard stops by and you wanna  engage on a little light bondage and moustache play!
Monica  What are you talking about? These aren't mine.
Chandler  Oh yeah, right! Good luck getting another scarf dance from  me!
Monica  That would be a terrible punishment. But, I'm serious, I've never seen these before.
Chandler  Really? Then what are they doing in our guestroom?
Monica  Rachel used to live in that room.
Chandler  Rachel... with handcuffs! Interesting! (he looks excited)
Monica  Joey's bare ass!
Chandler  (he doesn't look excited anymore). Well played.
Rachel  I love you Phoebe.
Phoebe  I love you too. (they hug) Please don't... Don't turn into... you know... French bitch! (they hug again)
Rachel  All right. Well, if I gonna do this, I'd better keep going.
Phoebe  Ok.
Rachel  Ok. Monica?
Monica  Yeah?
Rachel  Can you come here with me for a minute?
Monica  Sure.
Phoebe  (to Monica) Are you wearing waterproof mascara?
Monica  No.
Phoebe  Oh, you're so screwed. (Monica goes into the guest room)
Ross  (to Phoebe) Hey. What was that all about?
Phoebe  She's gonna say goodbye to each of us individually.
Ross  Are you kidding? Oh my God...
Phoebe  Yeah, I know, it's gonna be even worse for you... God... Ross, get ready to do some serious crying.
Ross  Oh, man, I'm not going to be able to handle this. (pause) Now I know how my students feel at the end of each year. And why they act out by giving me such bad evaluations.
[Scene  The guest bedroom. Rachel and Monica are talking to each other.]
Rachel  Mon... Okay... I've gotta... just say what it is I'm gonna say... None of the amazing things that have happened to me in the last ten years, would have happened if it wasn't for you. No-one has been more like a sister to me...
Monica  I know what you mean. You're like a sister to me too.
Rachel  (starts crying and speaking at the same time, making it almost impossible to understand what she's saying) I wouldn't know what I'm gonna do without you...
Monica  (having the same problem) You're the best friend I ever had.
Rachel  (says something that cannot be understood)
Monica  What?
Rachel  I... I... I... (again saying something that cannot be understood)
Monica  That is so sweet. (they hug)
[Scene  Back to the living room. Monica and Rachel enter and hug each other. The guys see this.]
Ross  (to Joey) Oh no, she took down Monica... And I'm the crier in the family. Oh God! I could be next. Maybe she won't talk with me if it looks like we're deep in converstation. Oh, so that thing you said about the thing. It really made me think about that other thing.
Chandler  Uh, Rach?
Ross  Well it's okay. Chandler is talking to her.
Joey  I really made you think about that thing uh?
Chandler  (to Rachel) Uh, Rach... I think I have something that belongs to you. (shows her the cuffs)
Rachel  (laughs) Oh, I'm sure gonna miss pretending to laugh at your weird jokes that I don't get.
Chandler  No, no, no... They're really yours. We... found them in your old room.
Rachel  Well, these aren't mine. Maybe Monica used to use them with...
Chandler  Don't say Richard! Well, if they're not Monica's and they're not yours, then whose are they?
Rachel  Well, I think you're forgetting the kinkiest former resident of that room.
Chandler  Pheebs!
Phoebe  (from the other side of the room) Yeah!
Chandler  I think these are yours.
Phoebe  These are not mine... Look how flimsy they are, come on! Good God! You try to hang a guy from a waterpipe with these, they'll snap like a piece of licorice.
Rachel  (to Chandler) Can I talk to you alone for a minute?
Chandler  Sure. (to Phoebe) You don't really handcuff guys to waterpipes do you?
Phoebe  Where do you think Mike really is? (she giggles, Chandler looks aghast)
[Scene  The guest bedroom. Chandler and Rachel.]
Rachel  Oh honey...
Chandler  Let me just say something... Because once we get into this, I'm gonna get all uncomfortable and probably make some stupid joke... I just want to say that I... I love you... And, I'm gonna miss you. And I'm so sad that you're leaving.
Rachel  (all mushy) Oh, you know what? Let's not say anything else. I love you. (they hug)
Chandler  Ooh, not so tight... (blows raspberry, and the hug ends) I'm sorry, just give me one more chance.
Rachel  Okay. Oh...
Rachel  Oh!
Chandler  I'm sor... Just go. Just go. I can't, I can't.
[Scene  Monica's living room. We look outside to the balcony where Rachel is saying goodbye to Joey.]
Monica  (to Ross) So, I guess you're next. You're ready?
Ross  I don't think so.
Chandler  Oh, you're definately not. I haven't cried like that in years.
Monica  You cried yesterday at the six o'clock news.
Chandler  That old woman was being scammed by her mechanic.
Ross  God! I can't believe she saved me for last. (looking out to the balcony) Why are they taking so long?
Phoebe  I don't know. But, God, Joey seems to be handling it suprisingly well.
All  No, no, no, no!
Ross  Okay, here we go...
Rachel  Oh... (holding Ross's shoulder) Well...
Ross  Yeah...
Rachel  I think I'm gonna take off. (pats Ross on his back, but he looks very surprised)
Ross  Huh?
Rachel  Oh, you guys. This was an amazing night. Thank you so much. I love you. Good night.
Ross  What? I don't get a goodbye?
Joey  (still very emotional) Lucky bastard!
[Scene  Monica's apartment continued... Phoebe, Chandler, Monica and Joey are sitting down and Ross is pacing up and down.]
Ross  Unbelievable. She says goodbye to everyone but me.
Monica  Well, maybe she thought that with all of your history it could be, you know, implicit.
Ross  Well, it needs to be plicit.
Joey  All right, let's think about this. I mean, there's got to be an explanation. Uh... did you do anything to make her mad?
Ross  No, I don't think so.
Phoebe  You know, maybe she was just really spent from our talk. It was pretty intense.
Monica  Yeah. Mine too.
Chandler  Mine was a humdinger
Ross  (annoyed) O-kay... I mean, don't I deserve anything? I mean, a few tears, a cursory hug? (Joey gives Ross a hug) NOT FROM YOU! (Joey lets go)
Phoebe  Ross, if you're this upset, you should go and talk to her.
Monica  And say what? "You owe me a goodbye", I mean, he's got more pride than that.
Ross  THE HELL I DO!
Ross  I don't get a goodbye?
Rachel  What?
Ross  (talking agitated and angry) Everyone gets a goodbye but me? What have I got to do to get a goodbye, huh? Be best friends with you? Uh, go out with you? Have a baby with you? Oh wait a minute, wait a minute, I did all those things.
Rachel  Ross...
Ross  Oh no, maybe it's me, I'm just not giving you enough credit. Uh, I mean it is difficult to say goodbye to five people. Uh, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, good... (makes choking noises) IT'S PHYSICALLY IMPOSSIBLE. You know what? After all we've been through, I can't believe this is how you want to leave things between us. Have a, have a good time in Paris. (He leaves the apartment. Rachel looks kind of desperate.)
[Scene  Monica and Chandler's apartment. The others are still there.]
Monica  I hope Ross isn't too upset.
Joey  I'm sure he's not more bummed out than I am.
Phoebe  Tell me about it.
Chandler  Well, you can't say we don't know how to throw a party.
Phoebe  All right, I think I'm gonna head out.
Monica  Uh, where do you think you're going?
Phoebe  I thought I was going home to go to bed, but I'm sensing there's something less fun for me to do here.
Monica  We're moving in a couple of days and we've got a lot of packing to do. It would be great if you guys could pitch in.
Chandler  Joey and I can finish up in the guest room.
Joey  Oh, yeah, yeah, good idea. (he mimes hitting his head with his fist)
Monica  Oh no! You and Phoebe are gonna help me in here.
Chandler  (to Joey) You couldn't be cool. (he goes to the guest bedroom)
Monica  Okay, we're gonna start in the kitchen. Plates get put into plate protectors and stacked ten to a box. The silverware gets bundled in rubber bands and then bubble wrapped. Got it?
Phoebe and Joey  Yeah.
Monica  Good! Now I need you to be careful and efficient. And remember, if I am harsh with you, it is only because you are doing it wrong.
Chandler  Hey Mon, I think I figured out whose handcuffs they are.
Monica  You did? How?
Chandler  Well, I was cleaning out the closet and I found some pictures of them... being used.
Monica  Oh my God! Let me see. (they all look at the pictures)
Joey  Who's that dirty old lady?
Chandler  Monica's grandmother.
Monica  Nana liked it rough!
Erica  Hi!
All  Hey!
Joey  Come on here, have a seat.
Phoebe  How was your night?
Erica  Oh, it was okay. I went to a movie with my cousin and then out for dinner. We went to this place that had... Ooh... (she looks likes she is in pain, holding her belly) Hoo... ooh... Anyway, they had these really amazing cheeseburgers.
Monica  Erica, are you okay?
Erica  Yeah, you know, maybe I ate too much. I keep getting these stomach aches. They come and go like every few minutes.
Monica  Oh my God!
Chandler  Relax! We just get her some antacids.
Monica  She doesn't have a stomach ache, she's in labor.
Chandler  Oh my God!
Phoebe  Yeah, you got to get to the hospital.
Monica  All right, Chandler get the coats. Erica let's go. Phoebe and Joey, keep packing! Oh my God we're gonna have a baby. All right. We're gonna have a baby! OH MY GOD, WE'RE GONNA HAVE A BABY! Oh God, oh God, I got to sit down, I got to sit down. Ooh! (she's hyperventilating)
Chandler  Honey, it's gonna be okay.
Erica  You can do this. Just breathe.
Monica  Okay, okay... Okay, I feel a little better.
Erica  (in pain) Ooh! Are you sure?
Monica  Oh... Yes, I'm sure. Oh honey, let's go. Okay bye everyone.
Joey  Chandler, wait, wait, wait...
Chandler  What?
Joey  If you get a second, find out where she got that cheeseburger.
[Scene  Ross's apartment. Rachel bursts in.]
Rachel  You really think I didn't say goodbye to you because I don't care?
Ross  That's what it seemed like.
Rachel  I cannot believe that after ten years, you do not know ONE thing about me.
Ross  Fine, then why didn't you say something?
Rachel  Because it is too damn hard Ross. I can't even begin to explain to you how much I'm gonna miss you. When I think about not seeing you every day, it makes me not want to go... Okay, so if you think that I didn't say goodbye to you because you don't mean as much to me as everybody else, you're wrong. It's because you mean more to me. So there, all right, there's your goodbye... Oh!
Ross  Rach!
Rachel  What?
Ross  You keep, you keep... You can't...
Rachel  WHAT?
[Scene  Chandler and Monica's apartment.]
Joey  A little more.
Phoebe  Okay. (she starts to stuff styrofoam peanuts down the front of Joey's pants.)
Joey  A little more, a little more. (she stuffs some more down his pants and Joey's assesses the how many there already are in there.) A little more... All right. Okay, all right, let's do this.
Phoebe  All right, ready?
Joey  Yeah. All right, now give me your best shot.
Phoebe  All right, here it goes...
Joey  (in pain) Doesn't work... (he falls down on on his knees with his head on the floor)

Erica  Yeah, you know, maybe I ate too much. I keep getting these 
  stomach-aches. They come and go like every few minutes.
Monica  Oh my God!
Chandler  Relax! We'll just get her some antacids.
Monica  She doesn't have a stomach-ache. She's in labor!
Chandler  Oh my God!
Rachel  So if you think I didn't say goodbye to you because you don't 
  mean as much to me as everybody else, you're wrong. It's because you 
  mean more to me.
Ross  Rach!
Rachel  What?!
[Scene  Ross's bedroom. Rachel is putting on her shoes as Ross shows 
  up from underneath the covers.]
Ross  Hey.
Rachel  Shh.. Go back to sleep. I have to go home.
Ross  Oh. This was amazing.
Rachel  It really was. You've learned some new moves!
Ross  Yeah, well, this guy at work gave me "Sex for Dummies" as a 
  joke.
Rachel  Ah.
Ross  Who's laughing now?
Rachel  I know!
[Scene  The delivery room at the hospital. Monica, Chandler and Erica 
  are there. Erica is in labor, and she is breathing heavily.]
Monica  Breathe, breathe, breathe... Good.
Chandler  Next time, can I say breathe?
Monica  No, last time you said it like Dracula, and it scared her! Can 
  I get you anything? You want some more ice chips?
Erica  No, I'm okay.
Monica  Alright, I'll be right back.
Chandler  Where are you going?
Monica  To use the bathroom.
Chandler  You can't leave me alone with her.
Monica  What?
Chandler  This is exactly the kind of social situation that I am not 
  comfortable with!
Monica  What kind of social situation are you comfortable with?
Chandler  It's just that we've never spent any time, you know, alone 
  together.
Monica  You'll be fine. Nah, you won't, but I'll be back in two 
  minutes.
Chandler  Okay.
Chandler  So, ah... Any plans for the summer?
Erica  I don't know. Maybe church-camp?
Chandler  Hah. May not wanna mention this. So, you ever wonder which 
  is worse, you know; going through labor or getting kicked in the nuts?
Erica  What?
Chandler  Well, it's just interesting. You know, because no one will 
  ever know, because no one can experience both.
Chandler  One of life's great, unanswerable questions. I mean, who 
  knows? Maybe there's something even more painful than those things? 
Like this.
[Scene  Joey and Rachel's apartment. Joey is there as Phoebe enters. 
  Joey is holding a baby duck.]
Phoebe  Morning.
Joey  Hey!
Phoebe  What's that?
Joey  It's my house-warming present for Monica and Chandler.
Phoebe  It's a baby chick and duck!
Joey  Uh-huh. And I named them Chick Jr. and Duck Jr.
Phoebe  I did not see that coming.
Joey  Yeah, I figure they'll love it at the new house, you know? It 
  has that big backyard. And then, when they get old, they can go to 
  that special farm that Chandler took the other chick and duck to.
Phoebe  Yes.
Joey  Yeah. It's a shame people can't visit there.
Phoebe  That is the rule, though.
Phoebe  Guess what? You're almost an uncle!
Ross  What?
Joey  Yeah, Erica went into labor last night. Monica and Chandler are 
  at the hospital right now!
Ross  Oh my God!
Phoebe  Yeah, and I have a definite feeling it's gonna be a girl.
Ross  Phoebe, you were sure Ben was gonna be a girl.
Phoebe  Have you seen him throw a ball?
Ross  Is Rachel here?
Joey  Uh, I think she's still asleep. Hey, hey, how did it go with you 
  guys last night? She seemed pretty pissed at you.
Ross  Uh, we, y'know, we worked things out.
Phoebe  What's that smile? Did something happen with you two?
Ross  Hey, I'm not one to kiss and tell, but I'm also not one to have 
  sex and shut up. We totally did it!
Joey  Oh my God. You and Rachel?
Ross  I know, it's pretty great.
Joey  So what does that mean? Are you guys getting back together?
Ross  Oh, I.. I don't know. We didn't really get to talk.
Phoebe  But do you wanna get back together?
Ross  I don't know. It was incredible. I mean, it just felt so right. 
  When I was holding her, I mean, I never wanted to let her go. You know 
  what? Yeah, I do. I wanna be together.
Phoebe  (screaming) YAY!
Ross  Shhh!
Phoebe  (quietly) Yay!
Joey  So, so is she still going to Paris?
Ross  Wow, I hadn't thought of that. I hope not.
Phoebe  Oh, this is like the best day ever. Ever! You guys might get 
  back together, Monica and Chandler are getting their baby, there are 
  chicks and ducks in the world again! Oh, I feel like I'm in a musical! 
  (Singing) "Daa - raa... When the sun comes up, bright and beaming! And 
  the moon comes..."
Rachel  Morning!
Phoebe  Guess we'll never know how it ends.
Joey  Okay.
Ross  Hey.
Rachel  Hey.
Ross  Hey. How did you sleep?
Rachel  Good. You?
Ross  Good.
Joey  I bet you did!
Ross  Uh. Would you guys mind giving us a minute?
Joey  Sure, yeah. Will you just keep an eye on the chick and the duck?
Rachel  Chick and the duck? Didn't they die...
Phoebe  (interrupting) Dive. Yeah, they dove head-first into fun on 
  the farm.
Ross  So...
Ross  Morning.
Rachel  You too. Last night was just wonderful.
Ross  It really was.
Rachel  I woke up today with the biggest smile on my face.
Ross  I know, me too. It was... You know, it was like one of those 
  things you think is never gonna happen, and then it does, and it's 
  everything you want it to be.
Rachel  Uh-huh. I know. It was just, it was just the perfect way to say goodbye. (She hugs him, and Ross looks crushed.)
[Scene  The Hospital. Erica is moaning and about to give birth. 
  Monica, Chandler, a nurse and a doctor are there with her.]
Monica  It's just a little bit more, honey.
Erica  Help me! This hurts!
Chandler  Is it really that bad?
Erica  Uh-huh! I think it's time to kick you in the nuts and see which 
  is worse!
Doctor  The baby's head is crowning.
Monica  Oh! Oh my God! That is the most beautiful top of a head I have 
  ever seen! Chandler, you have to see this!
Chandler  I'm okay.
Monica  Chandler, you don't wanna miss this. This is the birth of your 
  child! It's the miracle of life!
Chandler  Alright. Wow, that is one disgusting miracle.
Doctor  Start pushing. Here we go. Here come the shoulders...
Monica  It's a... It's a boy!
Chandler  Wow!
Erica  Is he okay?
Doctor  He's just fine.
Monica  Oh, you did it!
Chandler  (emotional) It's a baby! A beautiful little baby! And some
  other stuff I'm gonna pretend I don't see.
Doctor  Would you like to cut the umbilical cord?
Chandler  Well, that's spongy.
Monica  (to her son) Oh, hey handsome! Oh, I'm gonna love you so much
  that no woman is ever gonna be good enough for you! (To Chandler, on
  the verge of tears) Oh, we are so lucky!
Chandler  I know. He has your eyes.
Chandler  I mean, I know that's not possible, but he does.
Nurse  We'll just get him cleaned up a bit.
Chandler  Okay.
Monica  (To Erica) Oh my God, he's beautiful. Thank you so much.
Erica  I'm really happy for you guys.
Chandler  How do you feel?
Erica  I'm tired!
Doctor  Well, you don't have that much time to relax. The other one 
  will be along in a minute.
Monica  I... I'm sorry, who should be along in a what now?
Doctor  The next baby should be along in a minute.
Monica  We only ordered one!
Doctor  You know it's twins, right?
Chandler  Oh, yeah! These are the faces of two people in the know!
[Scene  The hospital. Continued from earlier.]
Doctor  I can't believe you didn't know it's twins! This has never 
  happened before.
Chandler  Well, gosh. That makes me feel so special and good.
Monica  (to the doctor) Wait, did you know it was twins?
Doctor  Yeah, it's here in the paperwork we got from the clinic in 
  Ohio.
Monica  (to Erica) Anybody tell you?
Erica  I don't think so. Although, they did mention something about 
  two heartbeats. But I thought that was just mine and the baby's. They 
  kept saying both heartbeats are really strong, and I thought well, 
  that's good 'cause I'm having a baby.
Monica  This is unbelievable.
Erica  Twins actually run in my family.
Chandler  Interesting! (To Monica) Can I see you for a second?
Chandler  What do we do?
Monica  What do you mean "what do we do"?
Chandler  (panicking) Twins! Twins!!
Monica  Chandler, you're panicking!
Chandler  Uh-huh! Join me, won't you?! Okay, what do you say we keep
  one, and then just like have an option on the other one?
Monica  We can't split them up!
Chandler  Why not? We could give each of them half a medallion, and 
  then years later, they'll find each other and be reunited. I mean, 
  that's a great day for everybody.
Monica  Okay, what if the person who adopts the other one is horrible?
Chandler  What if they're not? What if it's adopted by a king?
Monica  Yeah, because I hear the king is looking to adopt.
Chandler  Monica, we are not ready to have two babies!
Monica  That doesn't matter! We have waited so long for this. I don't 
  care if it's two babies. I don't care if it's three babies! I don't 
  care if the entire cast of "Eight is Enough" comes out of there! We 
  are taking them home, because they are our children!
Chandler  (smiles) Okay. Shhh...
Chandler  Okay.
Monica  Okay!
Chandler  Okay!
Doctor  It looks like we're about ready over here.
Doctor  Come on, Erica, start pushing again now.
Erica  Ow!
Doctor  Here she comes!
Chandler  (shocked) She? It's a girl?
Doctor  Yeah.
Chandler  (To Monica) Well, now we have one of each! (To the doctor) 
  And that's enough!
[Scene  Central Perk. Ross, Phoebe and Joey are there.]
Ross  And then she said it was the perfect way to say goodbye.
Joey  Oh my God! What did you say?
Ross  Nothing! What do you say to that?
Phoebe  Ross, you've got to tell her how you feel!
Ross  No way!
Joey  You can't just give up! Is that what a dinosaur would do?
Ross  What?
Joey  Dude, I'm just trying to speak your language.
Phoebe  Ross, Rachel doesn't know that you wanna get back together. If 
  she did, she might feel differently. She might not even go.
Ross  You really think so?
Phoebe  I'm telling you! Oh, okay! This is the part of the musical 
  where there'd be a really good convincing song. (Singing) "Bam-bam, 
  don't take no for an answer. Bam-bam, don't let love fly away. 
  Bam-bam-bam-bam..."
Rachel  Hi!
Phoebe  Can't a girl finish a song around here?
Joey  Hey!
Rachel  Hi! So I just dropped Emma off at my mom's.
Ross  Okay.
Joey  Oh, you're not taking her with you tonight?
Rachel  No, we decided that I would go ahead and set up first, and 
  then my mom would bring Emma to Paris on Sunday.
Phoebe  Wow, eight hour flight with a one-year old? Good luck, mom.
Rachel  Are you kidding? Eight hours with my mother talking about 
  Atkins? Good luck, Emma!
Ross  Alright, you know what? You're right. I should at least tell her
  how I feel.
Joey  Ross, wait!
Ross  What? What?
Joey  Could you get me a muffin?
Gunther  Rachel?
Rachel  Yeah?
Gunther  I... I know you're leaving tonight, but I just have to tell
  you. I love you.
Gunther  I... I don't know if that changes your plans at all, but I
  thought you should know.
Rachel  (touched) Gunther... Oh... I love you too. Probably not in the
  same way, but I do. And, and when I'm in a café, having coffee, or I
  see a man with hair brighter than the sun, I'll think of you. Aw.
Rachel  Oh... Bye guys.
Ross  Oh my God!
Phoebe  Unbelievable!
Joey  Hey, you know what might help?
Ross  I'm not getting you a muffin!
[Scene  The hospital. Monica and Chandler are holding the twins, while
  two nurses are taking care of Erica.]
Monica  Do you think they recognize each other from in there?
Chandler  Maybe. Unless they're like two people who have lived in 
  apartments next to each other for years, and then one day they're 
  pushed through a vagina and they meet.
Nurse  We're going to take Erica to recovery now.
Monica  There's something that we wanna tell you. We decided to name 
  the girl-baby Erica.
Erica  Oh my God, that's just like my name!
Monica  Son of a gun, it is!
Erica  Anyway, I'm gonna go and get some rest. I'm really glad I 
  picked you guys. You're gonna make great parents. Even Chandler.
Monica  Okay, well, bye!
Erica  Bye!
Chandler  Bye!
Monica  We'll call you!
Erica  Okay.
Chandler  Have fun at church-camp!
Monica  Oh, look at these little bunnies!
Chandler  I know! You ready to trade?
Monica  Okay.
Chandler  Okay.
Monica  Alright, let's see..
Chandler  We could trade later.
Monica  Yeah, I'm good.
[Scene  Monica and Chandler's apartment. Joey and Phoebe are there. 
  There is a white crib decorated with balloons in the middle of the 
  apartment. Also, there are boxes all over the apartment. Joey is 
  working on something on the coffee table.]
Phoebe  Hey, what are you working on?
Joey  It's a... It's a "welcome home" sign for the baby.
Phoebe  How sweet! Oh, is that the baby?
Joey  No, I sat in the paint.
Ross  Hey.
Phoebe  Hey. So, did you talk to Rachel?
Ross  No, and I'm not going to.
Phoebe  What?
Joey  Why not?
Ross  Because she's just going to shoot me down. You guys saw what 
  happened with Gunther. That did not look like fun.
Phoebe  How can you compare yourself to Gunther? I mean, sure, he's 
  sexy in a more obvious way. You have a relationship with her, you 
  slept together last night.
Ross  Yeah, and she still wants to go! It's pretty clear where she is.
Joey  Yeah, I know what you mean. I mean, sometimes...
Phoebe  Uh, Joe?
Joey  Damn it!
Ross  Look, even if I were gonna tell her, I don't have to do it now. 
  Okay? I'll be seeing her again. We've got time.
Phoebe  No, you don't! She's going to Paris! She is going to meet 
  somebody. Do you know how many hot guys there are in Paris? It's... 
  It's a city of Gunthers!
Mike  Hey!
Phoebe  Hey! What do you have there?
Mike  Oh, I made a little something. If I had more time to work on it, 
  it'd be better, but..
Ross  Oh my God! You did that yourself?
Phoebe  Honey, that's gorgeous!
Joey  You know, the baby can't read, Mike!
Rachel  Hi! You guys, the car-service just got here. I can't believe
  they're not home yet! I have to catch my stupid plane. I wanna see the
  baby!
Joey  Monica just called from the cab. She said they should be here
  any minute. And apparently, there's some big surprise.
Phoebe  Yeah, did she sound happy about it? 'Cause my friend Ethel's
  baby was born with a teeny, tiny beard.
Rachel  Oh my God!
Ross  Oh my God!
Rachel  Hi! Oh my gosh!
Chandler  Hey.
Phoebe, Ross, Rachel  Hey.
Joey  (To Monica) Hey, so what is the big surprise?
Rachel  Oh.
Ross  Oh my God!
Rachel  What... What...
Ross  Okay, okay, awkward question. The hospital knows you took two, 
  right?
Monica  Yes, it's twins!
Ross  Oh my God.
Joey  Oh, they're so cute! Now, what, what kinds are they?
Monica  (points at the baby she's holding) This is a boy, (points at 
  the baby Chandler is holding) and that's a girl.
Chandler  Her name is Erica.
Rachel  Aw..
Joey  Hey, that pregnant girl's name was Erica.
Chandler  Yeah. It's a shame you two didn't get to spend more time
  together.
Monica  Yeah, we named the boy Jack after dad.
Ross  Aw, he's gonna be so happy.
Phoebe  Oh, Jack Bing. I love that. Ooh, it sounds like a '40s
  newspaper guy, you know? "Jack Bing, Morning Gazette. I'm gonna blow
  this story wide open!"
Rachel  Oh my gosh. Wow, so beautiful.
Mike  (To Phoebe) I want one.
Phoebe  Oh yeah? Well, tell me which one, and I'll try slip it in my
  coat.
Mike  Seriously. Wanna make one of those?
Phoebe  One? How about a whole bunch?
Mike  Really?
Phoebe  Yeah! Ooh, we could teach them to sing, and we can be like the
  Von Trapp family! Only without the Nazis. Although that sounds kinda
  dull.
Rachel  Oh, you guys, I can't believe this. But I'll leave now, or I'm
  gonna miss my plane.
Monica  I'm just so glad you got to see the babies.
Rachel  Me too. Oh, I'm just sorry I'm not gonna be around to watch
  you two attempt to handle this! Alright, I can't say goodbye to you
  guys again. I love you all so much.
Monica  I love you.
Chandler  I love you.
Monica  Call us when you get there.
Rachel  I will. Ross, come here.
Rachel  I just want you to know.. Last night.. I'll never forget it.
Ross  Neither will I.
Rachel  Alright, now I really have to go. Okay. Au revoir! Oh, they're 
  gonna really hate me over there.
Phoebe  So, you just let her go?
Ross  Yeah.
Joey  Hey, maybe that's for the best.
Ross  Yeah?
Joey  Yeah. You know? You just... Look, you gotta... You gotta think 
  about last night the way she does, okay? Maybe, maybe sleeping 
  together was the perfect way to say goodbye?
Phoebe  But now she'll never know how he feels!
Joey  Maybe that's okay. You know? Maybe, maybe it is better this way? 
  I mean, now, now you can move on. I mean, you've been trying to for so
  long, maybe now that you're on different continents.. (Looks at
  Phoebe) Right?
Joey  Maybe now you can actually do it. You know? You can finally get
  over her.
Ross  Yeah, that's true. Except I don't wanna get over her.
Joey  What?
Ross  I don't! I wanna be with her.
Joey  Really?
Ross  Yeah, I'm gonna go after her.
Joey  Yeah, you are!
Phoebe  Woo!
Phoebe  Wait, wait! Get your coat! Get your coat!
Ross  My coat...
Joey  This is so cool!
Chandler  I have no idea what's going on, but I am excited!
Joey  But Ross, Ross. What do you, what do you think she's going to
  say?
Ross  I don't know, but I.. Look, even if she shoots me down, at least
  I won't spend the rest of my life wondering what would have happened.
  Where - where is my coat?!
Phoebe  You didn't bring one! My cab's downstairs, I'll drive you to
  the airport.
Ross  Okay, guys, wish me luck.
Phoebe  Hurry!
Joey  Good luck, good luck!
[Scene  The street right in front of Central Perk. Phoebe's cab is
  there. Ross and Phoebe run over and jump in.]
Ross  There's no seatbelt!
Phoebe  That's okay. If - if we hit anything, the engine will explode, 
  so you know, it's better if you're thrown from the car.
Ross  Alright, alright, let's do this!
Phoebe  Okay!
Ross  Hey!
Man  18th and East End.
Phoebe  I - I don't take passengers.
Man  Hey! The law says you have to accept any fare.
Ross  No, you don't understand. This isn't a real cab.
Man  Alright, I gotta report you. What's your medallion number?
Phoebe  My medallion number is, "Get out of the cab!"
Man  What?
Ross  (screaming) Get out of the cab!
Phoebe  Get out of the cab!
[Scene  Monica and Chandler's apartment. Monica, Chandler and Joey are
  there, packing the last boxes.]
Joey  Oh, hey, hey, can I give you guys your house-warming present 
  now?
Monica  Now, that you can do.
Joey  Alright!
Joey  Ah... Chick Jr.? Duck Jr.? Don't hide from mama!
[Scene  Phoebe's cab. Phoebe is driving very fast, and a terrified
  Ross has closed his eyes.]
Phoebe  You can open your eyes now.
Ross  Are we off the bridge?
Phoebe  Yes.
Ross  Is the old woman on the bicycle still alive?
Phoebe  Yes, she jumped right back up.
Ross  Oh my God, Phoebe, slow down!
Phoebe  Do you wanna get to Rachel in time?
Ross  Yes, but I don't wanna die in your cab!
Phoebe  You should have thought of that before you got in!
Phoebe  Toll-booth.
Ross  What?
Phoebe  (screaming) Toll-booth! Four bucks. There are quarters in the 
  glove compartment.
Phoebe  Hurry!
Ross  Okay!
Phoebe  Okay.
Phoebe  Damn, that window is clean.
[Scene  Joey's apartment. Joey is still looking for the birds.]
Joey  Quack, quack, tweet, tweet, quack, quack, tweet, tweet, quack,
  quack, tweet, tweet, quack, quack, tweet, tweet, quack, tweet, quack...
Chandler  We were wondering what was taking so long with the gift, but
  now we understand you were doing this.
Joey  Okay, I wanted to surprise you, but for your house-warming gift,
  I got you a baby-chick and a baby-duck!
Chandler  Really? You got us a chick and a duck?
Monica  Oh, great! Just what you want for a new house with infants.
  Bird feces.
Joey  Yeah, yeah, they must have jumped off the table, 'cause now
  they're gone!
Chandler  Oh, don't worry, we'll find them.
Monica  Actually, I'm gonna go check on the twins.
Chandler  Alright.
Monica  Oh God! What did I just step on?
Joey  Oh!
Chandler  It's okay, it's just an egg roll.
Monica  Oh..
Joey  You stepped on my egg roll?
Monica  I'm sorry, I didn't know to look for Chinese food on the 
  floor.
Joey  Just put it on a plate and leave.
Chandler  Okay, let's find these birds.
Joey  Alright.
Joey  Wait, wait. Do you hear that?
Joey  Oh! They're in the table!
Chandler  Well, that can't be good!
Joey  We gotta get them out of there!
Chandler  How?
Joey  Oh, oh! Maybe we can lure them out. You know any birdcalls?
Chandler  Oh, tons, I'm quite the woodsman.
Joey  Well, maybe we can just tip the table a little.
Chandler  Joey, wait! The ball!
Joey  Oh!
Joey  Oh God! So what do we do?
Chandler  I don't know. Maybe we can open this up somehow.
Joey  Okay.
Chandler  No... It's all glued together.
Joey  Does that mean we have to bust it open?
Chandler  I don't know. Maybe.
Joey  Oh my God!
Chandler  I know! It's.. It's the foosball table.
Joey  All right, you know what? We don't have a choice. It's like I would 
  have said in that sci-fi movie if I'd gotten the part. "Those are our 
  men in there, we have to get them out! Even if I have to sacrifice the 
  most important thing in my life; my time-machine."
Chandler  Did that movie ever get made?
Joey  It did not.
[Scene  The airport. Ross and Phoebe run in.]
Phoebe  Ross, where are you going?
Ross  To talk to Rachel, isn't that why we took a ride in the 
  death-cab?
Phoebe  What? What are you just gonna walk up to her at the gate? Have 
  you never chased anyone through the airport before?
Ross  Not since my cop-show got cancelled.
Phoebe  You have to get a ticket to get past security.
Ross  What? We're never gonna make it!
Phoebe  Not with that attitude! Now, haul ass!
Ross  Okay, if you could all walk slower, that'd be great.
[Scene  The gate. Rachel walks up to the man at the gate and gives him 
her passport.]
Gate attendant #1  (with a French accent) Madame, your passport 
  please?
Rachel  Oh my God! I was so afraid I wasn't gonna remember any of my 
  high-school French, but I understood every word you just said!
Gate attendant #1  Your boarding pass, please.
Rachel  Oh.
Rachel  Oh, shoot. I had it. Oh, I can't believe this.
Gate attendant #1  Madame, if you don't have your boarding pass...
Rachel  I have it, I have it, I have it. Oh, okay, I can't find it, 
  but I remember that I was in seat 32C, because that's my bra-size.
Gate attendant #1  Madame, you must have your boarding pass..
Rachel  Okay, fine! But you know what? If I was in 36D, we would not 
be having this problem.
[Scene  The ticket-counter. Ross and Phoebe come running.]
Ross  Hey, I need a ticket.
Phoebe  Just one? I drive you all the way down here, and I don't get 
  to see how it works out?
Ross  Fine, two tickets, I need two tickets.
Phoebe  We're on our honeymoon.
Ticket agent  And the destination?
Ross  I don't care. Whatever is the cheapest.
Phoebe  I'm so lucky I married you.
[Scene  The gate. Rachel is still searching for her boarding pass.]
Rachel  Oh! Shoot! Damn it! Where is it? Oh! Oh! I found it! I found 
  it!
Rachel  Hah! I found it! I told you I would find it! In your face! 
You're a different person.
[Scene  The ticket-counter. Ross and Phoebe have their tickets and 
  start looking at the screens in order to find the gate.]
Ross  Okay, flight 421 to Paris. I don't see it, do you see it?
Phoebe  No, did we miss it?
Ross  No, no, no. That's impossible. It doesn't leave for another 20 
  minutes.
Phoebe  Maybe we have the flight-number wrong. God.
Monica  Hello.
Phoebe  Hey, it's me. Here's Ross.
Ross  What? Hey, hey, listen..
Monica  Oh my God! Ross, you wouldn't believe the cute little noises 
  the twins are making. Listen.
Ross  Monica? Monica, Monica, Monica, Monica..?
Monica  Oh, I'm sorry. Shoot, they were doing it before.
Ross  That's alright. Listen, listen.
Monica  Oh, wait, wait, wait! Here they go again.
Ross  Monica? Monica, Monica, Monica, Monica..?
Monica  Isn't that cute?
Ross  That is precious! Listen! I need Rachel's flight information.
Ross  Yes, that's what I have. It's not on the board.
Ross  What?
Monica  Newark airport. Why, where are you?
Ross  JFK.
[Scene  Joey's apartment. Joey and Chandler are still trying to get 
  the birds out of the foosball-table.]
Joey  (yelling) Don't worry, you guys, we're gonna get you out of 
  there.
Chandler  And we're also gonna buy you tiny, bird hearing-aids.
Joey  Okay. Here goes.
Chandler  What's the matter?
Joey  I need to say goodbye to the table first.
Chandler  I understand.
Joey  Okay. Table, you have given us so many great times. And you 
  guys, Jordan, Victor, Joel... All of you guys. What can I say? You 
  guys make us look good. You wanna say anything?
Chandler  I don't know. Except that, for one last time... (he touches 
  the players as he says the following) Good game, good game, good game, 
  good game, good game, good game, good game.
Joey  Okay, here we go. I can't do it.
Chandler  Well, I can't do it either.
Monica  Hey! Did you find them?
Joey  Yeah, they're stuck inside the table!
Chandler  We have to bust it open, but neither of us can do it!
Monica  Oh, well sure. This gotta be so hard. I'll do it. Gimme!
[Scene  Phoebe's cab. She's driving faster than ever before.]
Ross  Phoebe! Wow! No, no, no!
Phoebe  Well, I've never gone this fast before.
Ross  Phoebe, forget it, okay? Newark is - is like an hour away. 
  There's no way we're gonna make it in time.
Phoebe  She's got her cell, you could call her.
Ross  I am not doing this over the phone.
Phoebe  You don't have any other choice!
Rachel  Hello?
Phoebe  Rachel? Oh, good. Hey, by the way, did you just get on the 
  plane?
Rachel  Yeah.
Phoebe  (To Ross) For what it's worth, we would have caught her if we were at the right airport.
Ross  Yay.
Phoebe  Uh, Rach, hang on.
Rachel  Phoebe? Is everything okay?
Phoebe  Uhm, actually no. No, you've... You have to get off the plane.
Rachel  What? Why?
Phoebe  I have this feeling that something's wrong with it. Something 
  is wrong with the left Philange.
Rachel  Oh, honey, I'm sure there's nothing wrong with the plane.
Rachel  Alright, look, I have to go. I love you, and I will call you 
  the minute I get to Paris.
Passenger #1  Uhm, what was that?
Rachel  Oh, that was just my crazy friend. She told me I should get 
  off the plane, because she had a feeling that there was something 
  wrong with the left Philange.
Passenger #1  Okay, that doesn't sound good.
Rachel  I wouldn't worry about it. She's always coming up with stuff 
  like this, and you know what? She's almost never right.
Passenger #1  But she is sometimes.
Rachel  Well...
Rachel  Wait, what are you doing?
Passenger #1  Well, I can't take this plane now.
Air stewardess  Excuse me, sir, where are you going?
Passenger #1  I have to get off this plane, okay? Her friend has a 
  feeling something's wrong with the left Philange.
Rachel  Could I get some peanuts?
Passenger #2  What's wrong with the plane?
Air stewardess  There's nothing wrong with the plane.
Passenger #1  Yeah! The left Philange!
Air stewardess  There is no Philange!
Passenger #1  Oh my God. This plane doesn't even have a Philange!
Passenger #2  I'm not flying on it!
Air stewardess  Ma'am, please sit down!
Passenger #3  What's going on?
Passenger #1  We're all getting off. There is no Philange!
Rachel  This is ridiculous! I...
Rachel  Yeah, okay.
[Scene  Joey's apartment. Monica has completely destroyed the 
  foosball-table, and Chandler and Joey are holding the birds.]
Monica  Alright. My job here is done.
Chandler  That was... Impressive.
Joey  Yeah, you didn't even use the tools for most of it!
Monica  Yeah, they were just slowing me down. Alright, I have to get 
  back to the babies. I'll see you girls later.
Chandler  Sorry about the table, man.
Joey  Yeah.
Chandler  You gonna buy a new one?
Joey  Probably not. Nah. I don't know how much I'm gonna wanna play 
  after you go.
Chandler  Well, at least we got these little guys out.
Joey  Yeah.
Chandler  Aww, we were worried about you! Hm. I guess I better get 
  used to things crapping in my hand, huh?
Joey  I'm gonna miss these little guys. It was nice having birds 
  around again.
Chandler  Hey, you know what? Maybe we should keep them here with you.
Joey  What?
Chandler  Yeah, I mean we've got a lot going on right now. And, plus, 
  here they'd have their own room.
Joey  I could get a goose!
Chandler  You know, I - I think you're set with the poultry.
Joey  Thanks man. Did you hear that, you guys? You're gonna get to 
  stay here! And, and it's good, you know, 'cause, 'cause now you have a 
  reason to come visit.
Chandler  I think there may be another reason. So, awkward hug or lame 
  cool guy handshake?
Joey  Uh, lame cool guy handshake, yeah.
[Scene  The gate at the airport. The passengers are standing in line, 
  and they're about to board the plane again.]
Gate attendant #2  Ma'am, I assure you, the plane is fine.
Passenger #2  And you fixed the Philange?
Gate attendant #2  Yes, the Philange is fixed. As a matter of fact, we 
  put a whole lot of extra Philanges onboard, just in case.
Ross  Where is she?
Phoebe  I don't see her.
Ross  Rachel! Rachel Green!
Phoebe  There she is!
Ross  Rachel! Rachel!
Gate attendant #2  Wow, excuse me, sir, do you have a boarding pass?
Ross  No, no, I just have to talk to someone.
Gate attendant #2  I'm sorry, you cannot go any further without a 
  boarding pass.
Ross  No, no, no, but...
Phoebe  (screaming) RACHEL!!
Rachel  Oh my God... What.. What are you guys doing here?
Phoebe  Okay, you're on.
Rachel  What? What? Ross, you're scaring me. What's going on?
Ross  Okay, the thing is..
Rachel  Yeah?
Ross  Don't go.
Rachel  What?
Ross  Please, please stay with me. I am so in love with you. Please, 
  don't go.
Rachel  Oh my God.
Ross  I know, I know. I shouldn't have waited 'till now to say it, but 
  I'm.. That was stupid, okay? I'm sorry, but I'm telling you now. I 
  love you. Do not get on this plane.
Gate attendant #2  Miss? Are you boarding the plane?
Ross  Hey, hey. I know you love me. I know you do.
Gate attendant #2  Miss?
Rachel  I - I have to get on the plane.
Ross  No, you don't.
Rachel  Yes, I do.
Ross  No, you don't.
Rachel  They're waiting for me, Ross. I can't do this right now, I'm 
  sorry. I'm sorry.
Ross  Rachel?
Rachel  I'm so sorry.
Ross  I really thought she'd stay.
Phoebe  I'm sorry.
[Scene  Monica and Chandler's apartment. Joey, Chandler, Monica and 
  the twins are there. Everything has been put into boxes.]
Monica  Well, that's it. Everything's packed.
Chandler  Wow, this is weird.
Monica  I know.
Joey  Yeah. Uh, does this mean there's nothing to eat?
Monica  I put three lasagnas in your freezer.
Joey  I love you!
Joey  Hey!
Phoebe  Hey.
Joey  So did you guys make it in time?
Phoebe  Yeah, yeah, he talked to her, but she got on the plane anyway.
Chandler  Where's Ross?
Phoebe  He went home. He didn't want to see anybody.
[Scene  Ross's apartment. Ross enters and checks his messages.]
Rachel  (on the answering machine) Ross, hi. It's me. I just got back 
  on the plane. And I just feel awful. That is so not how I wanted 
  things to end with us. It's just that I wasn't expecting to see you, 
  and all of a sudden you're there and saying these things... And... And 
  now I'm just sitting here and thinking of all the stuff I should have 
  said, and I didn't. I mean, I didn't even get to tell you that I love 
  you too. Because of course I do. I love you. I love you. I love you. 
  What am I doing? I love you! Oh, I've gotta see you. I've gotta get 
  off this plane.
Ross  Oh my God!
Rachel  (on the answering machine) Excuse me?
Air stewardess  (on the answering machine) Miss? Please, sit down!
Rachel  (on the answering machine) I'm sorry. I'm really sorry, but I 
  need to get off the plane, okay? I need to tell someone that I love 
  love them.
Air stewardess  (on the answering machine) Miss, I can't let you off 
  the plane.
Ross  Let her off the plane!
Air stewardess  (on the answering machine) I am afraid you are gonna 
  have to take a seat.
Rachel  (on the answering machine) Oh, please, miss, you don't 
  understand!
Ross  Try to understand!
Rachel  (on the answering machine) Oh, come on, miss, isn't there any 
  way that you can just let me off...
Ross  No! No! Oh my God. Did she get off the plane? Did she get off 
  the plane?
Rachel  I got off the plane.
Ross  You got off the plane.
Rachel  I do love you.
Ross  I love you too, and I'm never letting you go again.
Rachel  Okay. 'Cause this is where I wanna be, okay? No more messing 
  around. I don't wanna mess this up again.
Ross  Me neither, okay? We are - we're done being stupid.
Rachel  Okay. You and me, alright? This is it.
Ross  This is it. Unless we're on a break.
Ross  Don't make jokes now.
[Scene  Monica and Chandler's apartment. Chandler and Monica are 
  holding the twins. Joey and Phoebe are sitting by the window, while 
  Ross and Rachel are standing together. The apartment is completely 
  empty. Two men are carrying a large dresser.]
Monica  Okay, please be careful with that. It was my grandmother's. Be 
  careful.
Monica  If that falls off the truck, it wouldn't be the worst thing.
Ross  Wow.
Rachel  I know. It seems smaller somehow.
Joey  Has it always been purple?
Chandler  (to his children) Look around, you guys. This was your first 
  home. And it was a happy place, filled with love and laughter. But 
  more important, because of rent control, it was a friggin' steal!
Phoebe  Hey, do you realise that at one time or another we all lived 
  in this apartment?
Monica  Oh, yeah, that's true.
Ross  Uh, I haven't.
Monica  Wait a minute. What about that summer during college that you 
  lived with grandma, and you tried to make it as a dancer?
Ross  Do you realise we almost made it ten years without that coming 
  up?
Monica  Oh, honey, I forgot. I promised Treeger that we'd leave our 
  keys.
Chandler  Oh, okay.
Phoebe  So, I guess this is it.
Joey  Yeah. I guess so.
Monica  (crying) This is harder than I thought it would be.
Chandler  Oh, it's gonna be okay.
Rachel  (crying) Do you guys have to go to the new house right away, 
  or do you have some time?
Monica  We got some time.
Rachel  Okay, should we get some coffee?
Chandler  Sure. Where?
