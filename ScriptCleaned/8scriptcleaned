[Scene| The Wedding Hall, Monica and Chandler have just said "I do," and the
photographer is taking the required pictures. First of Monica, Chandler, Ross and Joey.]
Photographer| Great. (Takes a picture.) Great! Just give me a sec to change
film.
Monica| Okay.
Ross| (To Monica) Okay, I know Im not supposed to know, but I do. And
Im so excited for you!
Joey| What? Whats going on?
Ross| Monicas pregnant!
Joey| Oh my God! Is that why you guys had to get married?!
Monica| Guys! Im not pregnant.
Joey| Ah. (To Chandler) Slow swimmers? (Chandler looks at him.)
Ross| What?! What do you mean? You-you-youre not pregnant?
Monica| You didnt tell anybody I was did you?!
Ross| No! (Pause) Ill be right back. (Exits.)
Photographer| Now why dont we get a shot of just Monica and the bloody
soldier.
Monica| (To Joey) Oh, about that. Joey, you have to change before the party.
Joey| I cant! I-I dont have any other clothes here.
Monica| Find some! Please! Anything that doesnt say I-I died tragically in
France. (Joey leaves to find clothes.)
Photographer| Well then why dont we see the bride and the groom and the
bridemaids.
Phoebe| Okay. (Phoebe and Rachel join Monica and Chandler on the altar.) Hey
Mon, why did you tell the guys you werent pregnant?
Monica| Because Im not.
Phoebe| We found your test in the trash, if youre not pregnant(She
sees Rachel shaking her head)Its because I am.
Chandler| What?! What are you talking about?
Monica| What are you talking about?
Phoebe| Yes, II am with child. (Flash) And I didnt want to say
anything because its your day; I didnt want to steal your thunder.
Monica| Wait a minute! So you told people I was pregnant?! (Flash) Does this
look like a conversation that I want to remember?!
Chandler| Whos the father?
Monica| Yeah!
Phoebe| I cant say.
Monica| Why?!
Chandler| Why not?
Phoebe| I cant say because hes famous.
Rachel| Oh my God, who is it?! (Phoebe rolls her eyes.)
Monica| Phoebe, come on, you have to tell us.
Phoebe| Okay, okay. Its James Brolin. James Brolin is the father of my
baby.
Chandler| As in Barbara Streisands husband James Brolin?
Phoebe| What?! Well he never said that to me!
[Scene| The Wedding Hall, continued from earlier.]
Photographer| Why dont we have Monica step away and well get
Chandler and the bridemaids.
Phoebe| How about just the bridemaids?
Chandler| Yknow I am the groom right? I was told it was kinda big deal.
Phoebe| It is.
Rachel| For you. (Chandler leaves.)
Phoebe| Oh my God!
Rachel| Oh, thank you for doing that. I just cant deal with this just
quite yet.
Phoebe| So instead you told me Monica was pregnant.
Rachel| You said that she was, I just didnt disagree with you.
Phoebe| Sneaky.
Rachel| Oh yeah.
Photographer| Smile ladies.
Rachel| Oh! (They smile and the picture is taken.) Oh by the way?
Phoebe| Uh-hmm.
Rachel| James Brolin?
Phoebe| Oh, I know. I could only think of two names, him and Ed Begley Jr. and
then I remembered hes gay.
Rachel| Ed Begley Jr. is not gay.
Phoebe| (intrigued) Really?!
[Scene| The Reception Hall, the party is in full swing.]
Bandleader| Thank you very much! Ladies and gentlemen, it gives me great
pleasure to introduce to you for the very first time, Mr. and Mrs. Chandler Bing!
Chandler| Before we go out there Ive got a present for ya.
Monica| Honey, Im going to put my hand in your pocket!
Chandler| No?
Monica| No.
Chandler| Ive been taking dancing lessons.
Monica| What?!
Chandler| Yeah, the last six weeks. I wanted this to be a moment you will never
forget.
Monica| Oh that is so sweet!
Chandler| So? Would you care to join me in our first dance as husband and wife?
Monica| Yes.
Monica| Whats the matter?
Chandler| I dont know, its these new shoes, theyre all
slippery.
Monica| Well, are you going to be able to do this?
Chandler| Not well.
Monica| Well, the good news is, I dont think anyones looking at us.
Phoebe| So, are you ready to talk about it?
Rachel| No.
Phoebe| Now?
Rachel| No!
Phoebe| Okay, well talk about something else then.
Rachel| Thank you.
Phoebe| Whos the father?!
Rachel| Ugh! Look honey yknow what? I havent told him yet, so until
I do I dont think I should tell anybody else.
Phoebe| Yeah. Thats fine. Thats fair. Is it Tag?
Rachel| Phoebe!!
Phoebe| Okay, Im sorry. Ill stop.
Rachel| Okay.
Phoebe| Is it Ross? Its Ross isnt itOh my God, its Joey!
Rachel| Honey, stop it! I am not going to tell you until I tell him.
Phoebe| Ah-hah! At least we know its a him.
Monica| (seeing him) Oh sweet Lord.
Joey| Im sorry! Okay? I went down to the gift shop and its either
this or a bathrobe! Look, whats more important, the way Im dressed or me being
with you on your special day?
Monica| Honey, Im not even going to pretend I was listening. (Sees someone
else.) Hey! Hey! (Goes over to that person.)
Ross| Hi. Im uh, Im Ross. I dont, I dont believe
weve met. Im Monicas older brother.
Woman| Oh hi, Im, Im Mona from her restaurant.
Ross| Oh! Hello uh, Mona from her restaurant. (He uses his card to mouth those
words.) (Pause) Mona, wow what a, what a beautiful name.
Mona| You think so? Ive always kinda hated it.
Ross| Aw come on, Mona Lisa?
Mona| Uh-huh.
Ross| Mona ummClickclocken. The famous botanist? Huh? Oh no shes
uhwell shes dead now. No, supposedly she was once quite the hottie of the
plant world.
Mona| Really?! Well see? I never knew about her.
Ross| Linda Clickclocken. (Pause) So what uh, what-what table are you at? (She
shows him.) Oh, uh me too.
Mona| Oh good. Now therell be someone there who likes my name.
Ross| (sexily) Yes there will. (Mona leaves and Ross tries to find the same
table.) Oh guess what, Molly Gilbert youve just been bumped up to table one. And if
its all right with you Im gonna take your place at table sixMartin
Clickclocken.
Joey| Thats better, now just bend your arms a little more. There you go.
Okay, look straight ahead. Now this time I want you to really put your ass into it. (They
do a practice swing and she really puts her ass into it.)
Mrs. Bing| Chandler darling! Look, my date has finally arrived. Id like
you to meet Dennis Phillips.
Dennis Phillips| Congratulations.
Chandler| Thank you.
Mrs. Bing| Dennis is a dear old friend and a fantastic lover.
Chandler| Bravo Dennis thanks for pleasing my mother so.
Dennis Phillips| Oh, Im so sorry I missed the ceremony, I was stuck at
auditions.
Mrs. Bing| Oh yes, Dennis is directing a new Broadway show.
Joey| I dont believe weve met, Joey Tribbiani.
Dennis Phillips| Dennis Phillips
Joey| Wow, Ive admired your work for years. You-youve done some
really amazing stuff.
Dennis Phillips| Oh, thank you. Well if youll excuse me, Im gonna go
get myself a drink. Be back in a moment. (Walks away.)
Joey| Wow Dennis Phillips! Thats great! How did you guys meet?
Mrs. Bing| Well, its a funny story.
Chandler| Funny ha-ha or funny
Bandleader| Thank you, thank you very much. If everyone will please take your
seats, dinner will be served.
Ross| Hey! Uh, I thought, I thought you were at table six.
Mona| No, nine. (Shows him the card again.)
Ross| Oh see, before you uh, when you showed it to me you-you held it that way
(he turns her hand upside down) which uh, which was misleading. Well Im (He
goes at sits down at his new table and the kids stare at him.) Hello.
Joey| Chandler. Will you see if your mom can give my resume to Dennis Phillips?
Cause if I can get in a Broadway show then I wouldve done it all, film,
television, and theater. The only think left would be radio, and thats just for ugly
people.
Chandler| What size shoes do you wear?
Joey| Uh, eleven, eleven and a half.
Chandler| Great, because my shoes are giving me a little problem on the dance
floor, can I borrow the boots from your costume?
Joey| Uh, I dont even really know where I left those. Sorry.
Chandler| (looking at Joeys feet) Those arent eleven and a half.
Joey| Okay fine! Im a seven! All right, I have surprisingly small feet.
But the rest of me is good, Ill show ya!
Monica| Can you believe Phoebe got pregnant?!
Rachel| Oh yknow what honey? Lets not talk about that right now?
Monica| This is so huge.
Rachel| Sure, but come on, as big as your wedding?
Monica| Of course not nothing is. Between me and you
Rachel| Yeah.
Monica| in this day and age how dumb do you have to be to get pregnant?
Rachel| Hey! Yknow, sometimes you can do everything right, everyone can
wear everything theyre supposed to wear, and one of those little guys just gets
through!
Monica| How?
Rachel| I dont know! Maybe they have tools.
Monica| Well I-I talked to and uh, shes definitely going to have this
baby. Yknow, she said she was gonna raise it on her own.
Rachel| Well, maybe thats, maybe thats really brave.
Monica| Maybe. I just hope she realizes how hard its gonna be.
Rachel| Maybe she hasnt really thought it through that well.
Monica| Well, theres a lot to think about. I mean, how is she, how is she
going to handle this financially? How is she going to juggle work? Does she realize
shes not going to have a date again for the next eighteen years?
Rachel| (starting to cry) I dont know.
Monica| Are you okay?
Rachel| Uh-hmm. Im just thinking about Phoebe; poor knocked up Phoebe.
Waiter| Champagne?
Rachel| Oh yes! Thank you very much! (She grabs a glass, takes a sip, and
realizes what she just did. She then tries to spit the champagne back into the glass
without Monica noticing. It doesnt work.) Oh thats-thats actually how
the French drink it.
[Scene| continued from earlier, only now Phoebe joins them.]
Phoebe| Well, I just got off the phone with my lover, James Brolin
Monica| Oh really?!
Phoebe| Yes, and apparently he is married to some singer, but he said he would
leave her for me. And I said, "James, James Brolin, are you sure?" James Brolin
said
Monica| (interrupting) Rachels really the one whos pregnant.
Phoebe| (shocked) What?! (deadpan) Why bother?
Monica| How do you feel?
Rachel| I dont know. I dont know how I feel. This is all happening
so fast. I have to make all these decisions that I dont want to make. (Takes another
sip of champagne and spits it back out) Somebody just take this away from me!!
Phoebe| Calm down. Maybe youre not pregnant.
Rachel| What?!
Phoebe| When I got pregnant with the triplets, I took that test like three times
just to make sure.
Monica| Yes! Maybe its a false positive. Are you sure you peed on the
stick right?
Rachel| How many ways are there to do that?
Phoebe| Im-Im just saying, dont freak out until youre a
hundred percent sure.
Rachel| All right, Ill-Ill take it again when I get home.
Monica| You-you gotta take it now. Come on, do it as a present to me.
Rachel| Okay. Thank you.
Monica| Okay.
Phoebe| Ill run out and get you one.
Rachel| Oh, you guys are so great.
Monica| Oh, wait a minute! Whos is the father?!
Phoebe| Oh no, she wont tell us.
Monica| Oh, come on its my wedding! That can be my present.
Rachel| WhHey, I just gave you peeing on a stick.
Phoebe| See? This is why you register.
Ross| It was the chair again! Okay? Im not doing it! It whatlook, I
dontyknow whateh-eh (He walks away and goes over to Mona.)
Hi.
Mona| Hi!
Ross| Umm, would you like to dance?
Mona| Sure.
Ross| Yeah?
Mona| Yeah.
Ross| Oh great! (They get up to dance and Ross is interrupted by a little girl.)
Little Girl| Dr. Geller?
Ross| I wasnt farting! (To Mona) Uh, a little game from our table. (To the
little girl) Yes?
Little Girl| Dr. Geller, will you dance with me?
Ross| Oh umm, well uh, maybe-maybe later. Right now, Im about to dance
with this lady.
Little Girl| Okay. (She drops her head in disappointment and walks away.)
Mona| Ohhhh!
Ross| Uh, unless! Unless, uh this lady wouldnt mind letting you go first.
Mona| Id be happy to. (To Ross) You are very sweet.
Ross| Yes I-I am. In fact umm hey, why dont we try it my special way? You
can dance on my feet.
Little Girl| Sure!
Ross| Yeah? Hop on. (They start dancing and Mona sits down.) Is the pretty lady
looking?
Little Girl| Uh-huh.
Ross| Keep dancing.
Chandler| And the world will never know.
Joey| Hey! Did you talk to Dennis about me yet?
Chandler| Yes, I told him how talented you were. I told him all about Days Of
Our Lives.
Joey| No-no! No! No! You dont tell a Broadway guy that! Now he just thinks
Im a soap actor.
Chandler| But youre not just a soap actor. You are a soap actor
with freakishly tiny feet.
Joey| Hey!
Little Girl| Thank you.
Ross| No-no, thank you Miranda.
Little Girl| Melinda!
Ross| All right. (Walks over to Mona.)
Mona| How cute was that?
Ross| Oh-oh, were you, were you watching?
Second Girl| Can I go next?
Ross| What? Of course you can! Hop on!
Mona| Okay, but I get to hop on after her. (Ross bites the air in response.)
Ross| I am so gonna score.
Second Girl| What?
Ross| I like your bow.
Joey| (clinks his glass) Id like to propose a toast. To Monica and
Chandler, the greatest couple in the world. And my best friends. Now, my when I first
found out they were getting married I was, I was a little angry. I was like, (overly
angry) "Why God? Why? How can you take them away from me?!" But then I thought
back over all our memories together, some happy memories. (Does a fake laugh.) And-and
there was some sad memories. (Starts to break down and cry.) Im sorry. And-and some
scared memoriesWhoa! (He jumps back, startled.) Eh? And then, and then I realized
Ill always be their friend, their friend who can speak in many dialects and has
training in stage combat and is willing to do partial nudity. (Starts to walk away, but
realizes something.) Oh! To the happy couple!
Bandleader| Thank you.
Ross| (to the second girl) That was very nice Ashley.
Ashley|
Ross| No-no. (Walks over to Mona again.)
Mona| So, is it my turn now?
Fat Girl| Im next!
Ross| Oh! (Recoils in horror.)
Mona| Uh, thats okay. You can dance with her first.
Ross| Oh, you-you sure? (She nods yes.) Okay. (To the girl) Okay. So whats
uh, whats your name.
Fat Girl| Gert!
Ross| Thats, thats pretty. (They start to dance and Gert tries to
step on Rosss feet, but he pulls them out of harms way.) Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!
What are you doing there Gert?
Gert| Dancing on your feet! Like the other girls did it.
Ross| Okay. (Swallows hard.) Hop on Gert. (She does and Ross winces in pain.)
Gert| Why arent you moving your feet?
Ross| Im trying. (He strains to move his feet.)
Gert| Faster! Youre not going fast enough!
Ross| Maybe I should stand on your feet! (Gerts shocked and Ross realizes
what he said and tries to brush it off.)
Joey| So did you uh, happen to catch my toast up there?
Dennis Phillips| Oh my God, that was for my benefit?
Joey| Well, Id like to think there was something for everyone. Look, I
know youre casting for this new show
Dennis Phillips| Look umm Joey, I-I dont think youre quite right for
this project.
Joey| Oh, see thats where youre wrong. Whatever it is I can do it.
And if didnt see it up there, just-just try me.
Dennis Phillips| Its an all Chinese cast. Can you be Chinese?
Joey| Well Im not proud of this, but (He turns around and starts to
mess with his eyelids.)
Dennis Phillips| Oh my God! No-no-no! Please! Please!
Dont-dont-dont!
Monica| Hey, are you ready to get back on the dance floor?
Chandler| Did it turn into sand?
Monica| Ohh come on, I love this song! Come on, youll be fine. (She starts
to walk towards the floor.)
Chandler| (sliding up behind her) No. No, I wont. Do you know why I took
all those lessons? See, for the first time I didnt want you to be embarrassed to be
seen on the dance floor with some clumsy idiot.
Monica| Oh sweetie, you can never embarrass me. (Chandler grunts.) Okay, you can
easily embarrass me. But come on, it doesnt matter. All right? I married you! So I
want to dance on my wedding night with my husband. Come on. (They go onto the floor.) Just
try not to move your feet at all. (Chandler starts to get into the groove and bust a
move.) There you go.
Mr. Geller| Chandler, Im gonna have you arrested.
Chandler| Why?
Mr. Geller| You stole my moves. (He starts to dance like Chandler was and
Chandler stops.)
[Scene| The Womens Restroom, Rachel and Phoebe are waiting for the outcome of
Rachels second test.]
Rachel| How much longer?
Phoebe| 30 seconds.
Rachel| 30 seconds, okay.
Monica| (entering) Did I miss it? (Phoebe nods no.) Rachel, I-I want you to know
that, if its positive, were gonna
Rachel| Oh I know. I know. (They hug.)
Phoebe| Its time.
The Girls|
Monica| Go ahead Rach.
Rachel| Oh wait! Yknow what? I cant, I cant look at it. I
cant. Somebody else tell me, somebody tell me.
Phoebe| Okay.
Rachel| Okay.
Phoebe| Umm, its negative.
Rachel| What?
Phoebe| Its negative.
Rachel| Oh. Oh. Well there you go. Whew! (Pause) That isthats
greatthat is really great-great news. (Pause) Yknow cause the whole not
being ready and kinda the financial aspects, all that. Whew. Wow, this is so just the way
it was supposed to be. (Starts to cry.) God.
Monica| Well Well, great.
Phoebe| Here. (Gives Rachel a tissue.)
Rachel| Thanks. (Crying) God this is so stupid! (Pause) How could I be upset
over something I never had? Its negative?
Phoebe| No, its positive.
Rachel| What?!
Phoebe| Its-its not negative, its positive.
Rachel| Are you sure?
Phoebe| Well yeah, I lied before.
Rachel| Oh!
Monica| Oh God
Phoebe| Now you know how you really feel about it.
Rachel| Oh-oh, thats a risky little game!
Monica| Are you really gonna do this?
Rachel| Yeah. Im gonna have a baby. Im gonna have a baby. Im
gonna have a baby! (They all hug.)
Phoebe| With who?
Rachel| Ah, its still not the time.
[Scene| The Reception, Joey is helping Ross walk after Gert got through with him and
Mona is looking on concerned.]
Ross| I just didnt see the fast song coming.
Joey| Shh. Shh. Dont try to talk, well get you up to your room,
well soak your feet, youll be okay.
Ross| Oh, thank you.
Mona| That is so sweet!
Joey| Yeah.
Mona| No, I mean it. There are so few genuinely nice guys out there.
Joey| Tell me about it, I feel like Im holding down the fort all by
myself.
Mona| Its Joey right?
Joey| Yeah.
Ross| Wait a minute! No! Im the nice one! Im the one who danced with
the kids all night! HowHow small are your feet?! (They all look down.)

[Scene| The Hotel Lobby, Rachel and Phoebe are at the front desk checking out.]
Rachel| Listen yknow what sir? For the last time, I dont care what
the computer says, we did not take a bag of Mashuga nuts from the mini-bar and we did not
watch Dr. Do-Me-A-Little!
Joey| (entering) Hey!
Phoebe| Oh! Joey uh, were you in our room last night?
Joey| No. (Phoebe grabs the receipt and shows it to Joey who gets mad.) I was
told the name of the movie would not appear on the bill!
Chandler| (to the front desk clerk) Hi! Were checking out of the bridal
suite.
Monica| (depressed) Thats right. Im no longer a bride. Ill
never be a bride again. Now, Im just someones wife!
Chandler| And Im the happiest guy in the world! (Monica goes and sits down
in a huff.) Oh honey, come on dont be upset. We still have so much to look forward
to!
Monica| Oh yeah, right. (Rolls her eyes.)
Chandler| We got the honeymoon.
Monica| Thats not til Thursday.
Chandler| The wedding pictures?
Monica| They wont be ready for weeks.
Chandler| Not the disposable cameras from the tables.
Monica| Thats true! (Happily) I knew I married you for a reason!
Chandler| Ill tell you what, I will go get them developed and you can go
home.
Monica| Okay.
Chandler| What? What did you take a picture of?
Joey| Nothing! It was something.
Chandler| Okay Ross has the cameras, has he checked out yet?
Rachel| Are you joking? Check out is not til noon and he has a good
(checks her watch) eleven minutes left.
Chandler| Oh.
Monica| Ross has never checked out of a room a minute before he had to.
Rachel| Yeah, one time, when we were dating, uh we got a late checkout, he got
so excited it was the best sex we ever had. Until yknow, he screamed out Radisson
at the end.
Chandler| Okay, well Im gonna get Ross, get the cameras, and get them
developed. (Joey laughs again.) 32 Joe. Youre 32! (Exits)
Front Desk Clerk| (To Monica) Heres a copy of your bill.
Monica| Oh thanks. (Reading the bill) Champagne, strawberriesOh my God! I
cant believe Chandler ordered porn on our wedding night!
Joey| Yeah, thats sad. Mashuga nut?
[Scene| Rosss Hotel Room, he is letting Chandler in.]
Ross| Hi.
Chandler| Hey. (He sees that Ross is packing all of the hotel toiletries) Soaps?
Shampoos? Are you really taking all this stuff?
Ross| Why not? Its built into the price of the room.
Chandler| Yeah but you dont need(Picks up something)What is
this?
Ross| Thread!
Chandler| Score! Where are the disposable cameras?
Ross| What disposable cameras?
Chandler| The cameras? Remember last night I told you to take them?
Ross| No you didnt.
Chandler| Yes! Remember? Right before we cut the cake, I went up to you and I
said
Ross| Oh-oh yeah, you-you came up to me and asked if I could do you a favor, and
my Uncle Murray came up to you and handed you a check. And then you said, "Why do
they call it a check? Why not a Yugoslavian?" (Chandler laughs.) Yeah, then you did
that.
Chandler| So you dont have the cameras?!
Ross| No. Sorry man.
Chandler| So? What? What? Theyre gone! Monicas gonna freak!
Ross| Well, Im sure theyre still somewhere here in the hotel.
Ill-Ill help you look for them.
Chandler| Great.
Ross| In-in three minutes.
[Scene| Monica and Chandler's, Phoebe is entering to see Monica sitting in front of a
mound of wedding gifts.]
Phoebe| Hey!
Monica| Hey!
Phoebe| Are you gonna open the presents without Chandler?
Monica| No! (Pause) But, theyre callin out to me! I mean this little
guy (Holds up a small one) even crawled up into my lap. Oh come on, Chandler wouldnt
mind if I opened just one present! What do you think it is?
Phoebe| A little mirror that when you look into it you see yourself as an old
woman.
Monica| A tiny salt shaker!!!
Phoebe| Ohhh! My God! For tiny salt!
Monica| Oh wow! Okay. Well that was fun.
Phoebe| Oh yeah.
Monica| Good. Okay, Im just gonna wait for Chandler to open the rest of
them.
Phoebe| Okay.
Monica| Whew. Although yknow, this is part of a salt and pepper set. I
mean I guess yknow it may just count as a half a present. What do you think?
Phoebe| Well I guess its okay to open one more if its part of a set.
Yknow, its probably this one. (Grabs another small one.)
Monica| Or this one! (She grabs and starts to open the biggest present.)
Rachel| (entering) Hi.
Monica| Hey, how are you feelin? Any morning sickness?
Rachel| Shh-shh-shh! The guys dont know yet do they?
Monica| No! Joey and Ross dont know anything and Chandler still thinks
that Phoebes pregnant.
Phoebe| Yeah thats right Chandler does still think Im pregnant. He
hasnt asked me how Im feeling or offered to carry my bags. Boy, I feel bad for
the woman who ends up with him. (Monica looks at her.) After you of course.
Rachel| Dont worry I promise that you will only have to be pregnant for a
few more hours, cause Im going to tell the father today.
Phoebe| Ooh, is it someone in this building? Is it that tall guy from the first
floor?
Rachel| Ew! No!
Phoebe| What?! I think hes cute.
Rachel| Well then you have his baby.
Phoebe| Believe me Im trying.
Monica| Wow. Yknow it is so weird. I mean, youre gonna tell this guy
today and he has no idea whats gonna happen.
Phoebe| Yeah. Youre just gonna knock on his door and change his life
forever. Youre like Ed McMahon except without the big check, or the raw sexual
magnetism.
Rachel| Yeah. Uh-huh, I guess it is pretty big news.
Phoebe| Pretty big? Its huge! God, this guy doesnt have a clue!
Hes just walking down the street thinking, I had sex with Rachel Green. I
rock! then bam! Hes a father and everythings different.
Rachel| Well its only different if he wants it to be. I mean, Im not
gonna ask him for anything.
Phoebe| Okay. Then he still has this huge decision to make. Now hes
walking around thinking, Do I want to be a dad? and then bam!
Monica| What was that bam?
Phoebe| I dont. He gothe-he-he-hes hit by a bus.
Joey| (entering) Hey!
Rachel| Hey Joey, what would you do if someone that you slept with told you that
she was pregnant?
Joey| (warily) Who called here? Did she sound blond? Huh? Did-did-did she have
an accent? I gotta make a call! (Starts to leave) I shoulda never walked into that
Sunglass Hut!
Rachel| Oh Joey! Joey! No, its not you! You didnt get anybody
pregnant!
Joey| Oh. Why would you scare me like that? What the hell is going on? (Pause.)
Is somebody pregnant?
Phoebe| Oh yeah. Thats me.
Joey| Oh my God Pheebs! Youre gonna have a baby?
Phoebe| Yes. Yes I am. Oh my God, Im gonna have a baby! (Joey and Phoebe
hug.)
Joey| Whoa, wait a minute. Whos the father?
Phoebe| You dont know him. Its not important. He wants nothing to do
with me or the baby. (She sits down like shes pregnant.)
Joey| Well who is this guy?! Huh? Who is he? Cause I will track him down
and kick his ass!
Phoebe| David Lynn.
Joey| David Lynn! David Lynn! David Lynn!! (Exits)
Monica| Whos David Lynn?
Phoebe| Oh some guy from my gym. A little annoying.
[Scene| The Banquet Room, Chandler is under one of the tables as Ross enters.]
Ross| Chandler?
Chandler| Hey! Did you find the cameras?
Ross| No. Did you?
Chandler| Yes! And thats why Im under the table. Celebrating.
Ross| Well I checked in the uh, lost and found, I talked to the manager,
no-ones turned them.
Chandler| Well this is great. Yknow, those cameras were the only thing
that was gonna cheer Monica up today, shes really depressed.
Ross| Now you guys just got married, why is she so depressed?
Chandler| All my energy is going into not asking that question. I cant
believe I screwed this up!
Ross| Im sorry man. (Formally dressed people start to enter.) Heres
a thought. This is the same ballroom. Theres a band. Theres gonna be plenty of
dressed up people.
Chandler| Are you suggesting we dance our troubles away?
Ross| No-no-no, Im saying we-we buy more of this (disposable cameras) at
the gift shop, throw our tuxes back on, and take a few pictures. All we have to do is make
sure not to get anybody elses faces.
Chandler| Are you serious?
Ross| Im just thinking about your new bride at home. Okay? Do-do you
really want to start your life together by letting her down?
Chandler| Marriage advice? Really?!
Ross| Im telling you, this looks exactly like your wedding! Arent
these the same flowers?
Chandler| I dont know, Monica picked out the flowers.
Ross| What about the chairs?
Chandler| She picked those out too.
Ross| How about the place settings?
Chandler| That was her.
Ross| What did you do?
Chandler| I was in charge of the cameras! Gift shop?
Ross| Hmm. (They head off to the gift shop.)
[Scene| Central Perk, Rachel is sitting on the couch as Phoebe enters.]
Phoebe| Hey! Ooh, did you do it yet?
Rachel| Not yet.
Phoebe| Oh, well what are you doing here? Are you about to do it? (Gasps) Is it
Gunther?
Rachel| No! Phoebe, its not Gunther.
Phoebe| Thank God, cause that hair on a baby
Rachel| Phoebe the father is not here okay? I havent told him yet and I
dont think I can tell him at all now!
Phoebe| Why not?
Rachel| I dont know, let me think. I was walking down the street thinking,
Im gonna tell the father today and then bam!
Phoebe| Bus?
Rachel| No, you! Phoebe you freaked me out. You kept saying how huge this all
is!
Phoebe| Well-well but it is huge.
Rachel| I know, but I was just thinking about how huge this is for me. I
didnt even go to how huge this was going to be for the father.
Phoebe| Youre thinking about this way too much. Just tell him and get it
over with. Its like, its like ripping off this Band-Aid. (On her arm) Quick
and painless, watch. (Rips it off.) Oh mother ofSee?
[Scene| Monica and Chandler's, Obsessive Monica has now opened more of the wedding
gifts.]
Joey| (entering) Ooh-ooh-ooh! Are we opening presents?
Monica| No! No! I shouldnt have even opened these! I mean IJoey I am
out of control!! Joey, you have to do me a favor. No matter what I say, no matter what I
do, please do not let me open another present! Okay?
Joey| Okay.
Monica| Give me one more.
Joey| Okay. (Hands her one.)
Phoebe| (entering) Hey.
Joey| Oh good, uh youre here. Uh Pheebs? Listen uh sit down. I-I got
something I want to say.
Phoebe| All right. (She sits down like shes pregnant again.)
Joey| Umm, now uh Its a scary world out there, especially for a
single mom. Yknow, now I always thought you and I had a special bond so (He
goes to one knee and pulls out a ring.) Phoebe Buffay, will you marry me?
Monica| Oh my God! Joey!
Phoebe| Hell yeah! Ill marry you! (She grabs the ring and puts it on.)
Monica| You cant marry him!
Phoebe| Hey lady, your days over! Its my turn!
Monica| Phoebe!
Joey| Why?! Why cant she marry me?!
Phoebe| I can and I will! (Kisses him.)
Monica| Shes not pregnant. Its Rachel. Rachels the one
whos pregnant.
Joey| Oh my God.
Phoebe| Hey!
Monica| Phoebe I think he would notice if you didnt have a baby in nine
months!
Phoebe| Its Joey! (Joey turns and looks at her and she mouths I love
you to him.)
Joey| (smiles then stops) Now I cant believe it! What? Rachels
pregnant? (The girls nod yes.) Whos the father?
Phoebe| We dont know.
Joey| Ohh I wonder if that dude.
Monica| Theres a dude?
Joey| Yeah.
Phoebe| Who? Who is it?
Joey| About a month ago this guy spent the night with Rachel, I didnt see
who it was but (He walks out and closes the door.)
Phoebe| Was that story over?
Joey| The guy left this.
Phoebe| (gasps) Oh my God! I know who the father is (She walks into Monica
and Chandlers.)
Monica| People have got to finish their stories!
[Scene| The Banquet Room, Ross and Chandler are in their tuxes and have started to fake
the pictures.]
Chandler| (to another couple) Uh, excuse me? Could you take a picture of us?
Woman At The Wedding| Oh! Of course. (Ross and Chandler pose and she takes the
picture.)
Man At The Wedding| Uh, would you take one of us?
Chandler| Uhh Yeah sure. (Holds the camera up to his face.) Click!
Woman At The Wedding| It didnt click.
Ross| I heard it. I heard it.
Man At The Wedding| But there was no flash.
Woman At The Wedding| Why wont you take our picture?
Chandler| Oh yeah. Ill take, Ill take your picture. (He takes the
picture with his finger over the lens.)
Man At The Wedding| Uh, your finger was covering the lens.
Chandler| Who are you? Ansel Adams?! Get outta here!
[Scene| Outside Central Perk, Rachel and Phoebe are about to go inside.]
Phoebe| Look, I feel really bad about how I freaked you out before, so I called
the father and asked him to meet you here so you can tell him. Go!
Rachel| What? Hey wait a minute! Phoebe, how do you even know who the father is?
Phoebe| I may play the fool at times, but Im a little more than a pretty
blond girl with an ass that wont quit. (She takes the sweater out of her purse.) I
believe this belongs to the father of your baby.
Rachel| Oh God Oh, hes in there right now?
Phoebe| Uh-huh. Now you can turn around or you can go in there and rip the
Band-Aid off. What to you want to do?
Rachel| Uh, lets rip!
Phoebe| Really? Are you sure?
Rachel| Oh Phoebe!
Phoebe| Okay, sorry. Yeah. (They go inside to confront the father.)
Tag| Hey Rach.
[Scene| The Banquet Room, Ross is taking a picture of a plant, Chandler a fork. The
band stops.]
Chandler| Why dont you go up on stage. Ill get a picture of you
doing the speech.
Ross| Okay. Okay!
Ross| Will the owner of a 1995 Buick LeSabre please see the front desk? Your car
is about to be towed.
Anxious Wedding Guest| (rushing up) Thats my car!
Ross| A 95 LeSabre?!
Anxious Wedding Guest| Yes!
Ross| A green LeSabre?
Anxious Wedding Guest| Yes!
Ross| Im sorry, I meant a blue LeSabre.
Anxious Wedding Guest| Yes! Green-blue!
Ross| Well go! Go move it! (He runs off.)
Chandler| Okay, you ready for the last picture?
Ross| Yeah.
Chandler| Get ready to run. (Chandler walks over to the new bride.)
Congratulations on your wedding. (He grabs her, kisses her, Ross takes the picture, and
they both run out.)
[Scene| Central Perk, continued from earlier.]
Tag| So, whats this about?
Phoebe| Rachel has something that she wants to tell you and umm, I believe that
this is your red sweater.
Tag| No. (Unzips his coat.) This is my red sweater.
Phoebe| Oh no. Could I get anyone a coffee orpoison? No? Just for me?
Okay. (Walks away.)
Tag| Whats going on Rach?
Rachel| Nothing! Phoebe kinda made a mistake. But yknow you do wear that
sweater a lot, are you involved in some kind of dare?
Tag| Yknow, Im actually glad Phoebe called. (He pulls out a stool
and Rachel sits down.) I know we broke up because you thought I wasnt mature enough,
but Ive really grown up and think we should get back together.
Rachel| Oh, its just not the right time.
Tag| It is the right time. (Takes her hand.)
Rachel| Okay.
Tag| Im ready for more.
Rachel| Tag
Tag| Come on Rach, lets give it another try.
Rachel| Im having a baby.
Tag| Oh. (He drops her hand.)
Rachel| You can go.
Tag| Thank you. (Gets up and hurries out.)
[Scene| Monica and Chandler's, Obsessive Monica has finished opening all the presents.
Shes ashamed of this, at least, because as someone enters]
Monica| (throwing up the last present) I dont know how any of these got
opened?!
Joey| (entering) You opened them all?
Monica| I know! I know! I am a terrible person! I mean, Chandler is never going
to trust me with anything ever again!
Joey| Oh hey! You got my parents gift! (Holds it up.)
Monica| Yeah. What is that?
Joey| Well, I dont know. I think it does something to salami.
Monica| Hey! Howd it go?
Joey| Yeah. What-what did Tag say?
Rachel| Tag is not the father! And Joey knows now?
Joey| I do Rach. I do, and I so happy for you. (They hug.)
Rachel| Oh wow, you didnt even try to unhook my bra!
Monica| So are you ever gonna tell whoever it is?
Rachel| No, I will. Im just not up for it tonight.
Joey| Hey Rach listen, no matter what this guy says I want you to know
youre not gonna be alone in this.
Rachel| Im not?
Joey| Listen I uh (He takes her hand.) Its a scary world out there
especially if youre a single mom. Yknow, I always felt like you and I have
this-this special bond. Yknow? So, (gets down on one knee again) Rachel Green will
you marry me?
Rachel| What?
Monica| What?!
Phoebe| What?!!
Joey| Pheebs, give me the ring back!
Phoebe| No!!
Rachel| No! Joey, oh youre so sweet. Youre so-so sweet, honey. But
Im not, Im not looking for a husband.
Joey| (heartbroken) I understand.
Rachel| Now, if you will excuse me I am going to go and lie down. (Exits.)
Phoebe| I cant say that didnt hurt. But Ill take you back Joey
Tribbiani.
Joey| Uh yeah. Pheebs, listen about that. I only offered
Phoebe| Ooh! A Salami Buddy!
Joey| There you go!
Chandler| Were back!
Monica| Great! Were hangin in the kitchen! (She drags him into the
kitchen and turns his back to the living room) Lets stay in the kitchen!
Chandler| Its picture time.
Ross| Now you are going to love these.
Chandler| (showing her the pictures) Heres a picture of Ross. (Shows
another one.) And thats me. (Another one.) And thats me and Ross.
(Another one.) Oh-ho, that is a picture of our first kiss as a married couple.
Monica| Wow! That is a great picture!
Chandler| Eh?
Monica| Yeah! Oh and interesting because I found the cameras in one of our bags!
(Throws them into his chest.)
Ross| Huh, didnt see that coming.
Chandler| Okay, so this isnt a picture of our first, but it is a picture
of my first kiss withwith this lady. Which by the look on your face Im sure
youll remember. So we dont need(Rips the picture)Theres no
need to have this picture. How about I take the real pictures and get them developed right
now.
Monica| That would be a good idea.
Chandler| Okay. (Sees the living room.) You opened all the presents without me?!
I thought we were supposed to do that together!
Monica| You kissed another woman!
Chandler| Call it even?!
Monica| Okay! (They high-five and he walks out.)
Ross| Well, Im gonna go get these (the floral bouquet he walked in with)
in some water.
Phoebe| Wait you stole those from these peoples wedding?
Ross| No-no, I took them from the hotel lobby. Yeah, they think they can charge
me for some dirty movie and a bag of Mashuga nuts, they got another think coming. (Starts
to leave.) Hey! My sweater! Ive been looking for this for like a month!
Monica and Phoebe|
Joey| (slow on the uptake) Oh my God!
[Scene| A Street, Ross walks past Tag wearing the same red sweater.]
Ross| Hey! How you doing?
Tag| Good! Good, long time no see.
Ross| Yeah.
Tag| Like your sweater.
Ross| Oh hey, right back at ya.
Tag| Oh, its crazy about Rachel huh?
Ross| Yeah. SheWell, shes one crazy lady?
Tag| So whose is it?
Ross| (shows Tag his sweater tag) Umm, I dont some Italian guy. Come on,
read your own label. See you later.
Tag| Okay.
Ross| He is so weird.
[Scene| Monica and Chandler's, Monica and Chandler are getting ready to go on their
honeymoon. Monica is entering from the bedroom.]
Chandler| Hey! Babe! Arent you excited were going on our honeymoon?
Monica| Yeah I am!
Chandler| (singing) Bermuda, Bahama, come on pretty mama
Monica| Thats right. Get it out of your system while were alone.
Joey| (entering with Phoebe) Hey!
Phoebe| Yeah! Have a great honeymoon!
Chandler| Id better go pack.
Monica| Oh no, I already packed. The only thing I couldnt find though was
your Speedo.
Chandler| A Speedo? Uh, I dont have a Speedo. Im gonna go pack my
regular long bathing suit. (Goes into the bedroom.)
Rachel| (entering) Oh good youre still here!
Monica| Hey!
Rachel| I want to tell you to have a good honeymoon! (Hugs Monica.)
Monica| Thank you.
Rachel| And I also wanted you guys to know that I am telling the father today.
(They all look at her expectantly) What? What? What?
Joey| We know its Ross!
Rachel| How?! How do you know?
Phoebe| It was his sweater, butOh my God!
Rachel| Oh, I so wanted Ross to know first, but Im so relieved you guys
know.
Monica| This is so great! And Im gonna be your babys aunt!
Rachel| I know! (They hug.)
Phoebe| Me too! (Joins the hug.)
Joey| Im gonna be an uncle! Come here! (He joins the hug.)
Rachel| (breaking the hug) Youre all gonna be aunts and uncles.
Monica| Yeah, but Im the only one related by blood.
Rachel| Okay. Great! So now that you guys all know you can help me. Give me some
advice on how Im gonna tell Ross!
Monica| Well, what were you gonna say?
Rachel| Well I was gonna tell him that Im-Im gonna have the baby and
he can be as involved as he wants.
Joey| Well that, that sounds good.
Rachel| Yeah but how do I start? I mean, whats-whats the first thing
that I say? (They all pause to think.) Okay great! Thanks. (She starts to leave.)
Monica| Hey! Good luck!
Phoebe| Yeah, bye.
Joey| Bye.
Chandler| (entering) Hey, what was that all about?
Monica| Well I guess there is no harm in telling you now, Rachel and Ross are
gonna have a baby.
Chandler| (in a high pitched voice) What?! I didnt even know thatWhy
didnt you tell me?! (Pause) Why am I talking like this?!
Monica| I didnt think you could keep it a secret.
Chandler| (in the high pitched voice) What?! (Normal voice) I am an excellent
secret keeper. I have kept all of our secrets.
Joey| What secrets?
Chandler| Oh no-no Joey, I am not going to tell you because I am an excellent
secret keeper.
Joey| (whispering to Chandler) Youll tell me later?
Chandler| You already know.
[Scene| Joey and Rachel's, Joey and Phoebe are entering.]
Phoebe| Oh, it's so romantic to send people off on their honeymoon.
Joey| Yknow, Monica and Chandler are married. Ross and Rachel are having a
baby. Maybe you and I should do something.
Phoebe| All in good time my love. All in good time. Oh shoot! I left my guitar
in their apartment. Well you can let me in later.
Joey| I dont have a key, they took mine to give to you.
Phoebe| What?! They took mine to give to you!
Joey| Why would they take away our keys?
Phoebe| Maybe they dont trust us.
Joey| No thats not it. They let me keep my key the last time they were out
of town.
Phoebe| You mean the time you broke the ketchup bottle and cleaned it up with
Monicas guest towels?
Joey| Hey, I washed those!
Phoebe| No you didnt.
Joey| Yeah that didnt sound like me.
Phoebe| Well, what am I gonna do? I really need my guitar!
Joey| Yeah, I have stuff in there too.
Phoebe| What stuff?
Joey| Monicas chicken parm! Ill take care of it. (He picks up the
phone) Hey Mr. Treeger, its Joey Tribbiani. Listen, I need to get into Monica and
Chandlers apartment. Its an emergency. (Listens) Uhh, gas leak! Yeah oh, and
bring garlic bread. (Hangs up.)
Ross| (entering) Hey!
Phoebe| Did Rachel find you?
Ross| No why?
Phoebe| Oh she was looking for you.
Ross| Oh well, I guess Ill catch up with her later.
Phoebe| Well, she really wanted to talk to you now.
Joey| Yeah, it seemed pretty important.
Ross| Oh no.
Phoebe| What?
Ross| I think I might know what this is about.
Joey| Really?
Ross| Yeah. Uh, uh we promised we werent gonna tell anybody this but uh,
about a month ago Rachel and I slept together.
Phoebe| (deadpan) And?
Ross| Wow! I thought you would be a little more shocked.
Phoebe| Oh sorry. (Shocked) And?!
Ross| Well, we-we said wed just do it that one time but, but now I think
she may wanna start things up again.
Joey| Yeah, I dont think thats what it is.
Ross| Why? What-what else could it be?
Joey| Oh wow, I dont feel well.
Ross| Im telling you. Im telling you. Thats what it is. No
wonder she was looking at me all funny during the wedding. She didnt say anything to
you?
Phoebe| (To Joey) Maybe its something you ate?
Joey| Please, just-just, just go and talk to Rachel.
Ross| Yeah, I guess I should. (Starts to leave.) Man, yknow what I have to
realize? Maybe Im just not the type of guy women can have just one night with.
Yknow, they-they always seem to want a little bit more. I should remember that. (He
pauses and then exits.)
[Scene| The Airport Ticket Counter, Monica and Chandler are standing in line behind
another couple kissing who are next in line to be served.]
Ticket Agent| Next?
Monica| Theyre kissing lets just go around them.
Chandler| Oh honey, leave them alone, theyre in love.
Monica| Im in love too! But in an orderly fashion.
Ticket Agent| Next?
Monica| (to the couple) Hi! Can you do that and walk? Cause she
said, "Next."
Woman| Sorry. We didnt hear you; were on our honeymoon.
Ticket Agent| Oh, let me see what I can do. (Checks the computer) There are some
first class seats available.
Monica| (To Chandler) Did you hear that?! They bumped them up to first class
because they are on their honeymoon! Come on! Lets act like were on our
honeymoon.
Chandler| We are on our honeymoon.
Monica| Grab my ass!
Ticket Agent| Next?
Monica| Hi, sorry. I almost didnt hear you, because yknow Im
just so in love with my new husband. Were on our honeymoon.
Ticket Agent| Congratulations. Okay, Mr. Bing youll be in 25J and Mrs.
Bing youll be in 25K.
Monica| Oh no, you see were on our honeymoon. So umm, can you do your
little thing and bump us up to first class?
Ticket Agent| Im sorry, all our first class seats are taken. That couple
got the last two.
Monica| You see, if wed gone around them like I said, weShe
wouldve given us those tickets. Damnit!
Chandler| 25J and K, any chance those arent together?
[Scene| Joey and Rachel's, Phoebe and Joey are playing Rock em, Sock em
Robots.]
Joey| I still cant believe they took away my key. You trust me with yours.
Phoebe| Of course I do! And Im gonna give it back to you as soon as
theyre done with it at the key shining place.
Joey| What the hell is that?
Joey| Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Treeger, what are you doing?
Mr. Treeger| You said there was a gas leak in here.
Phoebe| Well why dont you use your key?
Mr. Treeger| Because by the time I find it on this thing (Holds up a huge key
ring with a thousand keys on it), the whole place might have exploded. If that happens at
another building that I manage, people are gonna start asking questions. (To the fireman)
Come on! Hurry up.
Phoebe| Oh! We could have done that.
[Scene| The Airport, Chandler and Monica are following the previous couple through a
tiny hallway that proves this is a set on a sound stage and not an actual airport, and see
them enter the first class lounge.]
Monica| Look at that! Look at that! Theyre going into the first class
lounge! Do you know what they have in there?
Chandler| No.
Monica| Me neither! We have to get in! (She runs through the door with Chandler
in tow.)
Chandler| Just act like you belong.
Monica| Oh my God! Oranges!
Chandler| Shh! (To the guy behind the counter) Nice to see you again. (They
tries to walk past him.)
Airline Employee| Uh sir, may I see your tickets please?
Chandler| Yes, of course. (Shows him the tickets.)
Airline Employee| Im sorry, would you move your thumb? I cant see
the seat number.
Chandler| Oh thats all right, I have it memorized. Its 1A.
Airline Employee| (grabbing the ticket from him) Sir, this is not a first class
ticket. Im sorry.
Chandler| Apology accepted. Excuse us. (They try to enter again.)
Airline Employee| Sir! Im afraid Im gonna have to ask you to leave.
Monica| Fine. (Starts to walk away then she runs over and grabs an orange before
she exits.) Go! Go! Go!
[Scene| The Hallway Outside Rosss Apartment, Ross is walking towards his
apartment and sees Rachel sitting in front of the door.]
Rachel| (seeing him) Hi!
Ross| Hi.
Rachel| Hi. (He helps her up.) Umm, I think theres something that we
really need to talk about.
Ross| (quietly confident) I think we do. Why dont we go inside? (They go
inside.) Look uh, I know why youre here.
Rachel| You do?
Ross| Yeah, and to save you from any embarrassment umm, I think maybe I should
talk first.
Rachel| (warily) Okay.
Ross| Okay. (He sits her down in a chair.) Uh, Ross and Rachel. Rachel and Ross.
Thats been one heck of a see-saw hasnt it?
Rachel| (confused) What?
Ross| I mean look, that-that one night we had was fun andand certainly
passionate, but dont you think its better if we just stayed friends?
Rachel| Seriously. What?!
Ross| Okay. Okay. Yknow what? If you want to, we can do it one more time.
I mean Id-Id be okay with that. In fact, I have some time right now.
Rachel| Okay, yknow what? Can I, can I talk now?
Ross| Oh sure. (He sits on the apothecary table and touches her hand.)
Rachel| (touches his knee) Im pregnant. (Ross stops.) Ross? (Ross is
staring off into space.) Ross? (Ross is still frozen) Okay, whenever youre ready.
(Sits back and opens her magazine.) And youre the father by the waybut you got
that
[Scene| Ross's Apartment, continued from earlier.]
Rachel| (closes her magazine) Can I get you some water?
Ross| Im good. Im good.
Rachel| Ross, there is no pressure on you. Okay? I mean you can as involved as
you want. (Ross nods.)
Ross| Yeah, I need uh Im justI dont knowI
dont understand, umm, how this happened? We-we used a condom.
Rachel| I know. I know, but yknow condoms only work like 97% of the time.
Ross| What? What? What?!! Well they should put that on the box!!!
Rachel| They do!
Ross| No they dont!!! (He runs to the bedroom to check and returns with
his box of condoms.) Well they should put it in huge black letters!!!!
Rachel| Okay Ross come on lets just forget about the condoms.
Ross| Oh well I may as well have!
Rachel| Listen, yknow what? I was really freaked out too when I found
out
Ross| Freaked out? Hey no, Im not freaked out! Im indignant!
As a consumer!
Rachel| Yknow what? Lets, lets talk later.
Ross| No! No! I want to talk now! Okay? IIn fact, (picks up the phone) I
am going to talk to the president of the condom company!
Rachel| Okay, yknow maybe I should come back (Starts to leave.)
Ross| (grabs her) Shh! Shh! Shh!
Rachel| (stops) Okay.
Ross| (on phone) Yeah Ill press 1! (Presses one which allows Rachel to
escape.)
[Scene| Monica and Chandler's, Mr. Treeger has finished inspecting Monica and
Chandlers apartment.]
Mr. Treeger| Ive looked everywhere. Theres no gas leak.
Joey| (eating) Huh. So then I can heat this up? (Goes and does so.)
Mr. Treeger| Anyway uh, Ill get moving on that new door.
Phoebe| Oh great! And listen, could you do us a favor and not tell Chandler and
Monica about this? Cause yknow umm, they dont-they dont have any
kids of their own and-and this door was like a child to them.
Mr. Treeger| Well Im gonna have to put on a new lock, theyll find
out anyway.
Phoebe| Oh no.
Mr. Treeger| (measures the top of the doorframe) Whoa! This looks like an all
day job, Ill have to cancel my yoga class. (Ross walks up.) Hey Ross!
Ross| Hi.
Mr. Treeger| Could you tell Jasmine that I won't make it to yoga class today?
Ross| Sure.
Mr. Treeger| Namaste. (Bows.)
Ross| Namaste. (Bows.)
Ross| Oh my God! What happened to the door?!
Joey| So its noticeable huh?
Ross| Look, is Rachel here? I really need to talk to her.
Phoebe| Didnt you two already talk?
Ross| Yeah but uh Okay, okay look you guys know that Rachel and I slept
together, but theres something else. (Pause) Rachels pregnant.
Joey| (simultaneously) Oh my God!!! I cant believe that!!
Phoebe| (simultaneously) Holy mother of God!!!
Ross| With my child.
Phoebe| That is brand new information!!
Ross| You already know dont you?
Phoebe| A little bit.
Joey| How are you doing?
Ross| Okay. Okay. I mean Ill be okay. Its just I dont think I
handled it very well.
Joey| Well, what did you say to her?
Ross| Nothing. But the complaint department at the condom company got an earful.
And then when I turned around she was gone.
Phoebe| Oh Ross.
Ross| But hey, in my defense I-I just found out condoms are like only 97%
effective.
Joey| (shocked) What?
Ross| I gotta go find her.
Joey| Whoa! Hey! Whoa!! Hold up! Are you serious?! So like 3% of the time they
dont even work?! Huh? They should put that on the box!
Ross| Evidently they do.
Joey| What?! (Grabs his condoms from his pocket and looks.)
[Scene| The Atlantis Resort, Chandler and Monica are arriving to check in, but are
behind the couple from before again.]
Monica| I cant believe were here.
Chandler| Oh youve got to be kidding me.
Monica| What? (Monica sees the first couple and gasps.)
Front Desk Clerk| As a wedding gift to you, the hotel would like to give you the
honeymoon suite.
Monica| No!! You have been screwing us all day!
Man| Who are you?
Chandler| Were you just ten seconds later!
Monica| Yeah! You already got the first class tickets; you got the lounge! I
mean we should get free stuff too! I mean youre not the only ones on your honeymoon!
Woman| Well you can have the suite if you want. We dont care about where
we stay. Were here to celebrate our love together. We dont have to get free
stuff. We just want to be together.
Chandler| (looks at Monica then at them) We need the stuff.
[Scene| Monica and Chandler's, Joey is on the phone and Phoebe is watching him.]
Joey| Hey Monica its Joey. Listen uh, Phoebe and I smell gas comin
from your apartment.
Monica| What? Are you serious?! (To Chandler) Joey smells gas!
Chandler| What else is new?
Joey| Yeah and wed go check it out, but you took away our keys.
Monica| Well do something! Get in there!
Joey| How? I guess I could break down your door.
Monica| Yeah! Do that!
Joey| And-and you wont blame us for any damage? (Gives Phoebe a thumbs
up.)
Monica| No! (Pause) Are you doing it?! I dont hear anything! Come on!
Joey| Uh, okay Ill-Ill-Ill break it down. (He hands the phone
to Phoebe, gets up, picks up a chair, and starts banging it on the floor.)
Phoebe| Oh hey hi, hes doing it. Hes breaking down the door. (The
chair breaks in half.) Okay, were in. (She hangs up the phone.)
[Scene| A doctors office, Rachel is on an examining table with her legs in the
stirrups.]
Nurse| Okay Rachel, are you comfortable?
Rachel| (sighs) If I said I was, would you judge me?
Nurse| The doctor will be here in a minute to do your sonogram.
Rachel| Okay. (The nurse exits.) Oh man, I swear if they sold these at Pottery
Barn
Ross| Hi!
Rachel| (shocked) Hi!
Ross| Uh we-we need to talk.
Rachel| Uh-uh-uh, right now? Because Ive kinda got an el fresco situation
going on over here.
Ross| Please, please I want to apologize for the way I acted earlier today.
Rachel| Okay Ross thats fine, but can you please stand near my head?
Ross| What? Oh yeah. (He moves next to her head.) Im sorry. I mean I-I
think I went a little crazy. I mean I was thinking about myself when I (Wanders towards
Rachels feet) reallyI should have been thinking about you Rach
Rachel| Okay. Head Ross! Head Ross! Head Ross!
Ross| Right! Right! I justI want you to know that Im going to be
there through this whole thing, okay? Okay? The doctors appointments, the uh, the
Lamaze classes, uh baby-proofing the apartmentAlthough we could probably worry about
that til after we get married.
Rachel| What married?
Ross| Well yeah, I think we should get married.
Rachel| What, because thats your answer to everything?
Ross| No, because thats the right thing to do.
Rachel| Yeah, maybe if youre in love. But Ross, we are not in love, are
we?
Ross| No butbut still you cant possibly do this alone.
Rachel| Excuse me?
Ross| Come on Rach, you cant even eat alone in a restaurant.
Rachel| What?!
Ross| Im just saying if you cant eat by yourself, how do you expect
to have a baby by yourself?
Rachel| I can too eat by myself!
Ross| When have you ever?
Rachel| When certain people leave the table and I am not finished!
Ross| Well certain other people take two hours to eat a bowl of soup!
Rachel| Oh please, you inhale your food!
Ross| I grew up with Monica! If you didnt eat fast you didnt eat!!
Dr. Long| (entering) Am I interrupting?
Rachel| Oh no Dr. Long, please come in. This is Ross, he is the father.
Ross| But not the husband, because evidently she can do this alone.
Dr. Long| Huh. Nice to meet you. Ill get started on this.
Ross| (To Rachel, standing by her feet) I dont know why you cant
admit that you need me.
Rachel| I do need you! I need you to stand near my head!
Dr. Long| Okay, everything looks good. Here it is on the screen. (We see Ross
and Rachel looking at the screen.) Here is your uterus. And right here is your baby.
Ross| Oh my God.
Rachel| Wow. There it is, I see it.
Dr. Long| Congratulations. Ill give you two a minute.
Rachel| Okay.
Ross| Thank you.
Ross| Pretty amazing huh?
Rachel| I dont see it!
Ross| What? What?!
Rachel| I cant see it!
Ross| You-you just said that you did!
Rachel| I know, I lied! I didnt want her to think I was a terrible mother!
I cant even see my own baby!
Ross| Oh sure, come here! (Sits her up) Sure you can! Uh, look come here look,
(rolls the machine closer) its-its-its, its right there (Points).
Rachel| Oh. Oh, its beautiful. I see it now.
Ross| Do you really?
Rachel| No, I dont see it!
Ross| Come on! Come on! Here, okay-okay, you see this? (Points) This tiny thing
that looks like a peanut?
Rachel| Yeah.
Ross| Sweetie thats it.
Rachel| Thats it? Well I saw that! Ohh-ohh-oh, thank you.
Ross| Youre welcome.
Rachel| Wow! I cant believe thats our baby.
Ross| Yeah, thats our baby.
[Scene| Joey and Rachel's, Joey and Phoebe are there as Rachel and Ross return from the
doctors appointment.]
Rachel| Hi.
Joey| Hey!
Phoebe| Hey! So how was the doctor?
Rachel| Oh, everything went great.
Phoebe| Good.
Ross| Oh hey, show them the picture of your uterus.
Phoebe| Oh.
Joey| I dont see the baby. Where is it?
Rachel| Oh no, I know I couldnt see it either at first, but its
right umm (Starts to cry) Ross, I lost it again.
Ross| Oh. (He takes the picture and hugs her.
[Scene| The Hallway, Chandler and Monica are returning from their honeymoon.]
Chandler| Wait. Before we go in, I just want you to know I love you. I had a
great time on our honeymoon, and I cant wait to go in there and spend the rest of
our life together.
Monica| Youre really sticking with the shell necklace huh? (Points to
necklace of shells hes wearing.)
Phoebe| Hi!
Joey| Hey! Youre back! (Hugs and kisses all around.)
Monica| Hi sweetie!
Phoebe| Come on in!
Phoebe| So how was the honeymoon?
Monica| Oh, so much fun. But the best part is, we met this incredible couple on
the way back.
Phoebe| That was the best part? (To Chandler) Good honeymooning tiger.
Monica| No, they were really cool. They were on their honeymoon too!
Chandler| Theyre terrific, and they live right here in the city.
Monica| Yeah, can we go call them? Is it too soon to call? I wanna call.
Chandler| Im sorry, were just kinda excited because we finally have
a couple to hang out with.
Monica| I know.
Joey| A couple? Like two people? Like (points to himself) one (points to
Phoebe), two people?
Monica| This is different! Greg and Jenny are in a relationship.
Phoebe| Oh, Greg and Jenny yuck! (Angrily) Hi Greg, Im Chandler this is
Monica. Hi Monica, this is Jenny. Hi Jenny. Hi Greg.
Chandler| Listen, they are really great. If you just got a chance
Joey| Yknow what? Why dont you just give us our souvenirs and get
the hell out of here?
Chandler| We reallydidnt get a chance to
Phoebe| You have got to be kidding me!
Monica| We didnt get anything for anyone.
Joey| Hm-mm! Yeah nice necklace!
Monica| That you can have.
{Transcribers Note| Tradition was broken here as there were no commercials
immediately after the opening credits, just more show.}
[Scene| Monica and Chandler's, Ross and Rachel are entering with the rest of the gang
already inside.]
Rachel| Hi!
All| Hey!
Ross| Hello!
Rachel| Welcome home.
Ross| So, how was the honeymoon?
Monica| It was great! It was great! How about you?! I mean youre having a
baby!
Rachel| Oh! Look! I have a sonogram picture!
Monica| Oh great! (Shows them the picture.)
Chandler| Ross! Its got your wavy black lines!
Monica| All right, so now that Ross knows can you tell us yknow how it
happened? I mean, when did it happen? How many times did it happen?
Phoebe| Monica! Thats not right! Start with where.
Rachel| Well it happened about six weeks ago, and uh I had just got home from
work and Ross was already there cause I guess he had been hanging out with Joey.
Joey| Youre welcome buddy.
Ross| (glaring at him) Yeah, thanks. (Joey nods no problem.)
Rachel| And so I had a lot of work to do so Ross, nice guy that he is, offered
to help me out. And then we had a little wine, we got to talking, and the next thing you
know out of nowhere Ross comes on to me.
Ross| (laughs) Umm thatsthats a little misleading.
Rachel| What is?
Ross| The lie you just told.
Rachel| That-that you came on to me?
Ross| Theres the one!
Rachel| But you did! I mean, lets be honest.
Ross| Yes lets. Yknow what? Uh, its-its not important.
What is important is that, is that were having a baby. And its
notDoesnt matter who came on to who.
Joey| Whom. (Everyone looks at him shocked.) Thats right.
Rachel| You know you kissed me first.
Ross| What? What?! You were begging me to kiss you! You-you-you were sending me
signals all over the place!
Rachel| I was sending you signals?
Ross| Yeah!
Rachel| Oh please. Okay, anyone in this room think that I would send Ross
begging symbols, please show of hands. (Ross raises his hand and no one else.)
Ross| Yknow what?! It doesnt matter! It doesnt matter what you
believe! What matters is what happened!
Rachel| Okay. So these signals Ross, explain this to me, cause maybe I
need to be more careful. I mean, am I sending you these signals right now?
Ross| Yknow what? Yknow what? Rachel, just-just drop it.
Rachel| No please, show me how I begged you!
Ross| I can show you, I have it on videotape! (Stunned silence) Its an
expression.
[Scene| Monica and Chandler's, time has lapsed, Phoebe, Joey, Chandler, and Monica are
sitting at the kitchen table.]
Phoebe| I cant believe he taped the two of them having sex!
Joey| Yeah! You gotta tell a girl before you tape her. Such a rookie mistake.
Chandler| Yknow who has a great video camera?
Phoebe| (nasally) Greg and Jenny?
Monica| Do you still wanna call em? I wanna call em.
Chandler| Lets call em.
Joey| Yeah! Ask them if they brought their friends any souvenirs!
Monica| (on phone) Hello? (Listens) Eighth street deli?
Joey| Hey, hang up! You get food poisoning just talkin to that place.
Monica| (on phone) Uh sorry, wrong number. (Hangs up)
Chandler| Here you go. (Shows her the number again.)
Monica| (on phone) Hello? (Listens) (To All) Its the deli again!
Joey| All right! Ill have a sandwich!
Monica| (hangs up) I dont think this numbers right!
Chandler| What?
Phoebe| You got fake numbered.
Monica| What?! People dont do that!
Joey| Oh I think we do.
Monica| They gave us a fake number? Why? Why would they do that?
Chandler| I dont know! You were a delight to talk to. You asked all those
insightful, great questions.
Monica| And youve never been funnier. Joke, joke, joke, you were a hoot!
Joey| Yknow what? Dont worry about it, you still got me and Phoebe.
Phoebe| Excuse me, I dont want Greg and Jennys rejects.
Ross| (entering) Rachel wont talk to me! She wont even open the
door!
Phoebe| Hmm, I wonder why. Pervert!
Ross| Okay, listen I am not a pervert!
Phoebe| Thats like the pervert motto! Yeah! Yeah! They have you raise your
right hand, put your left hand down your pants, and repeat that!
Ross| Filming Rachel is not something I planned. Okay look, heres what
happened, and Joey you-you can back me up on this. All right, about-about a month and a
half ago I came to you with a problem? Umm, a personal thing.
Joey| Personal thing? What personal thing? I dont know.
Ross| Aboutabout sex? (Joey looks at him confused) That I hadnt had
sex in months?
Joey| (laughs) Yeah I knew what you were talkin about.
[Scene| Joey and Rachel's, Joey is reading a cereal box as Ross enters wearing the red
sweater.]
Ross| Hey!
Joey| Hey.
Ross| Do you have a minute? Id like to talk to you about something
Im, Im really uncomfortable talking about.
Joey| Sure. What? About uh, you showering with your mom?
Ross| I actually had a topic in mind! Im, Im kinda going through a
dry spell, sex wise.
Joey| Whoa, for like months?
Ross| Five to be lying, six.
Joey| Six months? Whoa thats rough.
Ross| Well, I mean its not all bad. Im learning to appreciate the
uh, smaller things in life. Like the sound of a bird and the color of the sky.
Joey| The skys blue Ross and I had sex yesterday!
Ross| Please, help me! I have a date tonight. It has to go well
okayIm scared for my health!
Joey| Okay. Okay. UmmOoh! Oh-oh, I got something. Its this story I
came up with, very romantic. I swear any woman that hears it; theyre like putty.
Ross| Really? Well then tell it to me.
Joey| Okay. Now youre gonna want to have sex with me when you hear it, but
you have to remember it is just the story.
Ross| (sarcastic) Ill try to control myself.
Joey| Okay. (Clears throat) Years ago, when I was backpacking across Western
Europe
Ross| (laughs) You were backpacking across Western Europe?
Joey| Have a nice six more months Ross! (Starts to leave.)
Ross| (stopping him) Okay! Okay! Okay. Im sorry. Please, please, you were
in Western Europe and?
Joey| I was just outside Barcelona hiking in the foothills of Mount Tibidabo. I
was at the end of this path and I came to a clearing and there was a lake, very secluded.
And there were tall trees all around. (Whispering) It was dead silent. Gorgeous. (Softly)
And across the lake I sawa beautiful womanbathing herselfbut she was
crying
Ross| (intently listening) Why?
[Scene| Ross's Apartment, Ross is on his date with Kristen and theyre drinking
wine.]
Kristen| Umm, this is great wine.
Ross| Its from FranceIn EuropeWestern Europe. Yknow umm,
a few years ago I actually was backpacking across Western Europe.
Kristen| Really?
Ross| Uh-hmmWait! It gets better. Um, yeah I was in Barcelona.
Kristen| I studied for a year in Barcelona. (Ross is stunned and worried.)
Ross| Anyway, umm so I was um, I was hiking
Kristen| I love hiking!
Ross| (whines) Oh thats great! I was hiking along the foothills of Mount
Tibidaybo
Kristen| I think its Tibidabo.
Ross| Okay! Do you wanna tell the story?!
[Scene| Joey and Rachel's, Joey is standing at the counter as Ross enters.]
Joey| Whoa! What are you doing here? How did your date go?
Ross| Great! Im across the street having sex with her right now. Your
story sucks!
Joey| Hey! Look, if it didnt work its because you didnt tell
it right! Show me how you did it.
Ross| No! No, I dontdont want to.
Joey| How long since youve seen a girl naked?
Ross| I was backpacking across Western Europe.
Joey| Im not feeling it.
Ross| I was just outside Barcelona, hiking
Joey| No! No! No Ross! Im not hot! Are you hot?
Ross| Its been six months! Im always hot!
Joey| Well youre not selling the story! Its like; its like you
dont believe it! Look, I gotta go. I got a date, but try this. Do what I do when
Im preparing for an audition. Okay? Ill set you up with my video camera and
you can record yourself and-and see what youre doing wrong.
Ross| Ill try that.
Joey| All right now All right, youre all set up. Youre good to
go. Just hit record. All right?
Ross| Thanks.
Joey| Good luck.
Ross| Thanks. And-and hey Joe?
Joey| Yeah?
Ross| Listen, if you ever have any problem with the ladies you know Ill
help you out.
Joey| (trying not to laugh) That means a lot to me man. (Exits.)
Ross| Hello! Can I get you anything? Huh? Lens cleaner? Your battery okay?
(Rachel bursts in carrying two boxes and Ross jumps up.) Rachel!
Rachel| Oh Ross!
Ross| Hi!
Rachel| Thank God youre here! You have to help me! Were you just talking
to yourself?
Ross| Thats less embarrassing, yes. Yes I was.
Ross| (voiceover) So when she came in, I got distracted and totally forgot about
the camera. [Cut back to the present day.] It kept rolling and recorded everything.
Chandler| Yeah, were gonna need to see that tape. (They rest of them
agree.)
Monica| Yeah, definitely.
Ross| What a great idea! That will get Rachel to forgive me!
Joey| Yknow what? This is not fair to her. Lets just forget the
tape!
Ross| Thank you. (Joey mouths to Ross, "Youll show me right?")
No!
Joey| Youre right. (Mouths, "I know youll show me, right?)
Ross| Joey! No!
Joey| Loud and clear! (Mouths, "Youll show me," and nods.)
[Scene| Monica and Chandler's, Monica, Chandler, Joey, and Phoebe are now sitting in
the living room.]
Monica| I still don't get why Greg and Jenny would give us a fake number.
Joey| Yknow, if they knew what they were doing they probably didnt
give you real names either.
Monica| Okay, maybe people give out fake numbers, but they dont give out
fake names.
Joey| Oh yeah? (To Phoebe) Hi, Ken Adams, nice to meet you.
Phoebe| Regina Philange. (Ken and Regina shake hands.)
Chandler| I still dont get it, we didnt do anything wrong.
Monica| I know! Although, you did tell an awful lot of jokes.
Chandler| I thought you said those jokes were funny. Joke! Joke! Joke!
Monica| (rolling her head from side to side) Joke. Joke. Blah! Blah! (Joey and
Phoebe laugh.)
Chandler| Well maybe it was all of your questions.
Monica| What about my questions?
Chandler| The sheer volume, it was like flying with the Riddler!
Monica| Oh, Im sorry. Was that another joke?
Chandler| (angrily) Was that another question?
Rachel| (entering) Hey! Is Ross still here?
Joey| Uh no Rach, hes gone. But listen, he told us what happened and it
does, it sounds like an honest mistake.
Rachel| Oh really? Well how would you like it if I had sex with you and I taped
it? (Joey smiles luridly) Oh forget it! (Ross enters.) Oh there he is now, the father of
my child, the porn king of the west village.
Ross| Look, it was accident! Okay? I-I feel bad that it happened, but I swear, I
didnt even watch it! Anyway, here. (He takes the tape out of his coat pocket.) I
thought you might be more comfortable destroying it yourself. (Tosses her the tape.)
Rachel| Thank you. (She sets it on the floor and is about to stomp on it with
her shoe when the rest of the gang jumps up and yells simultaneously.) What? (They all
yell again.) You dont want to see this do you?
Monica| Hell yeah!!!
Rachel| I am not gonna show you this!
Phoebe| No! Not the sex part, just the stuff leading up to it.
Ross| Forget it, shes destroying it.
Phoebe| Okay fine! Fine! Well just have to think of some other way to put
the whole Who came onto who, thing to rest! Come on now, think!!
Ross| Look, forget it Phoebe. Okay? Its Rachels tape and she can do
whatever she wants with it. And she wants to destroy it. So, end of story.
Rachel| I wanna see it.
Ross| What?!
Rachel| Clearly you dont want people to see this tape. Now I dont
want people to see this tape either, but you so badly dont people to see it makes me
want to see it. You see?
Joey| (confused) Are we watchin the tape or not?!
Ross| I dont want people to see it for your sake.
Rachel| Ahh, I dont believe you. I think you dont want them to see
you begging me. (Goes to put the tape in the VCR)
Ross| Rachel, please
Rachel| Ah, a little preview!
Ross| Fine. Fine, but I want the record to show that I tried to take the high
road, because in about five minutes Im gonna be saying(He laughs and points at
Rachel sarcastically.)
Rachel| Okay, here we go. (Pushes play.)
Ross| (on tape) Hello! Can I get you anything?
Joey| (To Phoebe) Im so happy!
[Scene| Monica and Chandler's, the scene is continued from earlier.]
Rachel| (on tape) Oh, thank God youre here! You have to help me! Were you
just talking to yourself?
Rachel| There I am.
Phoebe| Youre gonna get pregnant.
Rachel| (on tape) I screwed up so bad, I told Monica that I would stuff and send
all these wedding invitations like weeks ago and I-I
Ross| (on tape) You didnt do it?
Rachel| (on tape) I-I knowI had put them inin-in my desk at work and
I completely forgot about them until today.
Monica| (taking Rachels hand) Sweetie okay. Its okay. Everybody made
it to the wedding. Im fine.
Rachel| Kinda hurtin my hand though.
Monica| I know.
Rachel| (on tape) (Ross hands her a glass of wine) I cannot believe that I did
this. Especially after Monica just went on and on and on about it! (Mimicking Monica)
"Okay Rachel! Here are the invitations Rachel! Now be very careful Rachel! Please,
drinking no liquids around the invitations Rachel!" (She tilts her wine glass above
and moves it back and forth across the invitations) Whoa oh! Oh-oh-oh!
Ohoh-oh-oh
Chandler| Did you do it on our invitations?!
Ross| (pause) Not on the ones we sent out.
Chandler| So, just the ones gave back to us and we had framed! (Slams the framed
invitation down onto the table.)
Rachel| (on tape) Can you believe this is already happening? I mean it seems
like yesterday they just got engaged.
Ross| (on tape) I know. Hey rememberremember the night they got engaged?
How uh, you and I almost
Rachel| (on tape) Oh, I remember how we almost. Do you think we wouldve
gone through with it? Yknow, if we hadnt gotten caught. Do you think we
wouldve done it?
Ross| (on tape) I mean II know I wanted to. I just, I just wasnt
sure if you wanted to.
Rachel| (on tape) Oh I wanted to.
Ross| (on tape) So wewe both wanted to.
Rachel| (on tape) Interesting.
Ross| (on tape) Yeah. (Pause) Anyway umm, it probably worked out for the best.
Rachel| (on tape) Oh yeah, sure.
Rachel| Okay, in about ten seconds youre gonna see him kiss me.
Ross| And in about five seconds youre gonna see why.
Rachel| (on tape) Ross did I ever tell you about the time that I went
backpacking through Western Europe?
Rachel| Okay, get ready to see some beggin!
Phoebe| Oh, you came on to Ross!
Rachel| What?!
Ross| Now Im so happy.
Rachel| What are you talking about?!
Monica| You used the Europe story!
Chandler| Thats the magic story you use when you wanna have sex!
Rachel| How do you know about that story?!
Joey| How do you know about that story?!
Rachel| I heard it from my friend Irene who heard it from some guy!
Joey| (raises his hand) Some guy!! (Points to himself.)
Rachel| No. No, she told me his name was Ken Adams.
Joey| (raises his hand and points to himself again) Ken Adams!!
[Scene| Joey and Rachel's, Rachel is looking at the tape sitting on the counter as Ross
enters.]
Ross| Hi.
Rachel| So uh, apparently people are familiar with the Europe story?
Ross| Yeah. Listen about that, the whole uh, who came on to who thing really
doesnt matter. I mean, I think it wouldve happened either way. I mean if you
hadnt initiated it I-I-I know I wouldve.
Rachel| It was an amazing night.
Ross| It was. It was an amazing night.
Rachel| You think it looked amazing?
Ross| I uh I dont know. I mean II honestly didnt watch
it.
Rachel| Yeah, me neither. Yet
Ross| Uhhhhhhthat-that may be weird.
Rachel| Yeah, it would be really weird.
Ross| Good luck.
Rachel| Good luck to you.
Ross| Mind if I mute?
Rachel| Oh please. (He does so.)
Ross| Oh, oh there go the clothes.
Rachel| You are undressing very quickly.
Ross| Six months Rachel, six months.
Ross and Rachel|
Ross| Hey. We-we lookwe look pretty good.
Rachel| Thats what I was gonna say.
Ross| Oh nice tan!
Rachel| Thank you! I had just gone to the beach that weekend.
Ross| Ah.
Rachel| Have you been working out?
Ross| I have been working out.
Rachel| Really? Wow, this is so much better than I
Ross and Rachel|
Ross| Oh thats not pretty.
Rachel| Oh! Oh!
Ross| No!
Rachel| Oh God!
Ross| Oh no!
Rachel| Oh, make it stop!
Ross| Oh no!!
Rachel| Make it stop!!
Ross| No!!
Rachel| Have to make it stop!!
Ross| No!!!
[Scene| Monica and Chandler's, Monica and Chandler have gone through the phone book and
found Greg and Jennys number which Monica has just dialed.]
Monica| (on phone) Hello Greg? (Listens) Hi, this is Monica from the plane?
Listen, the number that you gave me 853-5 (Listens) (To Chandler) That is their old
number! Jennys been giving it out since they moved!
Chandler| Jenny! That is so Jenny!
Monica| (on phone) Hey listen umm, how would you like to get together? Say next
Saturday? (Listens) Okay, how about Sunday? (Listens) Okay umm, the week after that?
(Listens) The week after that? (Listens) Yknow what Greg? Yknow what? We are

Jenny cant see that then (Listens) January 15th? (Chandler dances.)
Well see you then! (Listens) Okay!
[Scene| Monicas Restaurant Kitchen, she is frantically working and is handing two
finished dishes to a waitress.]
Monica| Okay, now this one is rare, this one is medium well! Now go-go-go!
(Phoebe enters) Hey Phoebe!
Phoebe| Hey!
Monica| Hey how was dinner?!
Phoebe| Dinner was good!
Monica| Okay!
Phoebe| Im just saying hi! Now Im gonna go!
Monica| Okay!
Phoebe| (To him) Oh, well hello there.
Guy| Hi.
Phoebe| (To Monica) I didnt see this on the menu.
Monica| Uh Tim? This is Phoebe. Phoebe this is Tim, my new sous chef.
Phoebe| Oh, so you're Monicas boss?
Tim| Actually shes my-my boss. Sous is French for under.
Phoebe| Oh! I sous stand.
Monica| Hey Tim? I need a calamari and a Caesar salad. And umm, could you get me
the pesto?
Tim| Yeah.
Phoebe| Oh youyou made pesto?
Tim| Yes I did.
Phoebe| Would you say your pesto is the best-o?
Tim| II-I dont know, but I would say its pretty good-o.
(Phoebe laughs too hard.)
Monica| All right, I still need a calamari and a Caesar salad.
Tim| I like your necklace.
Phoebe| I made it myself.
Tim| You are so talented.
Phoebe| Well, its no pesto.
Monica| All right, all right! Lets just cut to the chase, okay? (To
Phoebe) Youre single. (To Tim) Youre single. (To Phoebe) He gets off work at
eleven. (To Tim) Shell be waiting for your call. (To Phoebe) Ill give him your
number if I can get one calamari and one Caesar salad!! (Everyone in the kitchen stops.) I
did not yell. I am not putting a dollar in the jar.
[Scene| Chandlers Office, hes working at his computer as his boss, Mr.
Franklin, sticks his head in.]
Mr. Franklin| Wow Bing! Burning the midnight oil.
Chandler| You know me sir. Oh ah, I do have a question for ya. Do you know how I
get around the office computer network so I can access the really good Internet porn?
Mr. Franklin| Youre a joker Bing. (Walks away.)
Chandler| Whats funny about that?
Ross| (running up) Hey! Sorry I kept you waiting so long.
Chandler| Hey thats okay. So, where do you want to go?
Ross| Oh ah, I think you know where I want to go.
Chandler| The Hard Rock Café?
Ross| Yeah!
Chandler| Again?!
Ross| Yeah!!
Ross| Im telling you, I like the food!
Chandler| You like the Purple Rain display! (A guy walks up.) Hey Bob.
Bob| Hey Toby! Have a good night. (Walks by.)
Ross| Did that guy just call you Toby?
Chandler| Yeah, he thinks thats my name.
Ross| Well, why dont you correct him?
Chandler| Oh its been going on way to long now. Yknow, I mean the
first time he said it we were just passing each other in the hallway, so I didnt say
anything. And then the next time he said, "Hey Toby, do you want a donut?" And
I-I wanted a donut. And now its five years later, the donuts gone and Im
still Toby.
Ross| Five years?! Chandler you have to tell him!
Chandler| No! That would be so awkward! LookBesides, we work in different
departments. Hes on the sixth floor yknow? So he calls me Toby once in a
while. Whats the big deal? It could be worse, its not like hes calling
me Muriel. (Chandler suddenly freezes into place.)
Ross| (laughs) Muriel. Wh-why would he call you Muriel? (Ross realizes
something.) Oh my God! Chandler M Bing? Its not just an M, your middle name
is Muriel!!
Chandler| Shh! It is a family name!
Ross| Chandler Muriel Bing. Boy, your parents never gave you a chance did they?
[Scene| Days Of Our Lives set, Joey is doing a scene with a co-star as Rachel
watches on a monitor.]
Joey's Co-Star| Drake, Ive discovered the reason for all your headaches
and memory loss.
Dr. Drake Ramoray| What is it?
Joey's Co-Star| Apparently your brain transplant was not entirely successful. It
seems your body is rejecting Jessicas brain.
Dr. Drake Ramoray| Is it serious?
Joey's Co-Star| Not if we extract tissue from the original host body, synthesize
antibodies, and introduce them into your system, which could stop it from rejecting the
brain.
Dr. Drake Ramoray| Well that sounds simple enough, lets just do that.
Joey's Co-Star| We would, but when we went to exhume Jessicas body, it was
gone.
Director| Cut! Very nice people!
Joey| (To Rachel) Okay, let me just get changed and we can go to dinner.
Rachel| Well dontWhat happened to Jessicas body?!
Joey| Im not telling, youll have to see it on TV!
Rachel| You dont know do you?
Joey| No, couldnt care less.
Joey's Co-Star| Hey good scene man.
Joey| Hey you too!
Joey's Co-Star| Alright.
Joey| What? You werent in it.
Rachel| Oh! (Motions to Joeys co-star.)
Joey| Oh sorry. Uh-uh, Kash?
Kash| Yes?
Joey| This is my friend Rachel. Rachel, Kash, Kash, Rachel.
Rachel| Hi.
Kash| Hey! How come I havent seen you here before?
Rachel| Well, Joey probably thinks Ill just embarrass him. Yknow, he
thinks Im some kind of a soap opera nutWhich Im not! Im not.
Although I do know that your uh, your favorite ice cream flavor is butter pecan. (Starts
stroking his arm) And uh, and that your-your dogs name is Wally. Well look at that,
Im just stroking your arm.
Joey| (grabbing her) Here we go! Here we go! (Starts to pull her away from
Kash.)
Rachel| Oh, were leaving. Bye Kash.
Kash| Bye.
Rachel| Say hi to Wally.
[Scene| Central Perk, Monica is getting coffee as Phoebe enters.]
Phoebe| Ooh Monica!
Monica| Hi!
Phoebe| Oh my God! I had the best time with Tim last night. He is so
sweet! Oh, I cant wait to get sous-neath him.
Monica| II have to fire him.
Phoebe| But why?!
Monica| Because hes terrible! Okay, hes slow, he burns things, last
night he lit my pastry chef on fire!
Phoebe| Well maybe he was just nervous, yknow you can be very
intimidating. And besides Ive met your pastry chef and she can stand to be taken
down a peg or two.
Monica| Well, now she has no eyebrows, mission accomplished.
Phoebe| But Monica, he loves his job so much! Can you just give him another
chance? Please?
Monica| (thinks about it) All right, but if-if he lights someone else on fire he
is out of there!
Phoebe| Thats fair! Thank you so much. Thanks. Oops, it looks like when he
got the pastry chef he got you a little bit too.
Monica| I paid to have this done.
Phoebe| Love it!
[Scene| Joey and Rachel's, Rachel is eating at the counter as Joey enters.]
Joey| Hey!
Rachel| Hi!
Joey| Oh you know uh Kash, really liked you the other day. He said he thought
you were charming.
Rachel| I thought I was a complete idiot.
Joey| Hey, Im with you. He even asked me if I thought youd go out
with him.
Rachel| Oh! Oh, I think Im gonna throw up a little bit. What did you say?
Joey| I said no.
Rachel| What?!
Joey| What? II just figured since youre pregnant youre not
gonna be seeing people.
Rachel| Okay Joey, first of all Kash Ford is not people. Second of all, what did
he say when you told him I was pregnant?
Joey| I didnt tell him. I didnt know if you were telling people.
This is back when I thought Kash was still people.
Rachel| Good-good, dont tell him. Dont tell him. Just have him call
me okay?
Joey| Rach look, I really dont think thats such a great
Rachel| Okay, you go do it! Ill come back to that set! Ill meet more
actors! Ill meet em all!
[Scene| Chandlers Office Building, Chandler is walking by the elevators and sees
Bob standing there.]
Chandler| Hey Bob.
Bob| Hey! Hows my pal Toby doing today?
Chandler| If I see him, Ill ask.
Bob| (laughs) Toby!
Mr. Franklin| Hey-hey! Bing? Was that Bob from six you were just talking too?
Chandler| Yeah!
Mr. Franklin| Oh then you know each other.
Chandler| Were on a semi-first name basis.
Mr. Franklin| What do you think of adding him to our team?
Chandler| Bob? Ooh, working here with us? Everyday? Yeah, I dont know if
he has what it takes.
Mr. Franklin| Really? They love him down on six.
Chandler| But this is eleven. Its almost twice as hard up here.
Mr. Franklin| Okay, I hear you loud and clear. Bob will stay put.
Chandler| I think its best sir.
Mr. Franklin| But we really do need to find someone up here. The work is
starting to pile up. Ive got a stack of documents on my desk this high. (Holds his
hand at shoulder level.)
Chandler| Yknow what you should do, just toss em in the shedder and
claim you never got em.
Mr. Franklin| (laughs) Thats a good one. (Walks away.)
Chandler| What does a guy have to do to be taken seriously around
here?!
[Scene| Monica and Chandler's, Monica is in the kitchen as Phoebe enters.]
Phoebe| Hey!
Monica| Hey. Okay, I gave him another chance, but Tim has got to go!
Phoebe| But
Monica| No! No-no! He is totally incompetent. I called the chef who recommended
him to me. He said, "Ha-ha! Gotcha!"
Phoebe| Okay. Okay, but you cant fire him today.
Monica| Why not?!
Phoebe| Because Im dumping him today.
Monica| What?! You said he was sweet!
Phoebe| He is sweet. Hes too sweet. He calls me all the time.
(Mimicking him) "So did-did you get home from work okay?" "Did-did you get
out of the shower okay?"
Monica| Just dont pick up your phone.
Phoebe| Then he comes over! (Mimicking him) "Im so worried about
you." Uck! Be a man!
Monica| What? So now Im not allowed to fire him?
Phoebe| You cant fire him and dump him the same day, hell kill
himself.
Monica| Okay well then, Ill fire him today and you go out with him for
another week.
Phoebe| Are you kidding?! Another week with that sip, Ill kill myself!
Monica| Okay well, then well both do it today and hell just have to
deal with it!
Phoebe| Okay. But the question is whos gonna go first. Cause whoever
goes second is the bitch.
Monica| What do you mean?
Phoebe| Come on! The boss that fires a guy thats just been dumped, bitch!
And the woman who dumps a guy thats just been fired, blond bitch!
Monica| I wanted to do this days ago so I think I should go first.
Phoebe| All right, that makes sense. (Starts towards the door.) Ugh.
ButScrew you Im going first! (She grabs her purse and runs out.)
[Scene| Chandlers Office Building, Bob is standing at the elevators and sees
Chandler walk up.]
Bob| Hey Toby, you got a sec?
Chandler| Sure, whats up?
Bob| I just had a meeting, I was actually hoping to get transferred up here, but
I just found out its not gonna happen. Apparently somebody thinks Im not eleventh
floor material. Say uh, who the hell is this Chandler?
[Scene| Joey and Rachel's, Rachel is getting ready for her date and Joey is reading a
magazine.]
Rachel| Hey, what do you think is a better excuse for why Im not drinking
on this date tonight. "Umm, Im a recovering alcoholic. Im a Mormon,"
or "I got so hammered last night Im still a little drunk?"
Ross| (entering with a pizza and beer) Hey!
Rachel| Hi!
Joey| Hey!
Ross| So, what do you want to do tonight? Theres a Ukrainian film at the
Angelica thats supposed to be very powerful. Interested?
Joey| No. No. But Ill go see a normal person movie with ya.
Ross| Rach? You wanna come?
Rachel| Oh no, I cant. I got a date.
Ross| A date?
Rachel| Yeah. Why? Is that weird for you?
Ross| Why no, its the opposite of weird. Its-its uh, regular.
Its-its uh, its mundane. Its actually uh, a little dull.
Joey| Its no Ukrainian film.
Rachel| YeahOoh! Earrings! (Goes into her room.)
Ross| A date?! Shes-shes got a date?! With who?
Joey| I set her up with this actor on my show.
Ross| You set her up?!
Joey| No
Ross| Joey what-what were you thinking?!
Joey| Well, I was thinking that itd probably be okay because Ross
hasnt gone out with Rachel in five years!
Ross| Joey, Im not worried about her! Im worried about my baby!
Whoever she dates my baby dates! Now-now where is this (makes the quote-marks sign) actor
taking them?
Joey| Hey! Im an (does the quote-marks thing as well) actor too! Im
not sure. I think theyre taking the ferry out to some Italian place on Staten
Island.
Ross| A ferry? My baby is going on a ferry? Do you have any idea how dangerous
those are?!
Joey| Are we talking about one of those big boats that carry cars that go like
five miles an hour?
Ross| Why dont they just jump out of an airplane?! Huh?! That-thats
a fun date! Or burn each other with matches?! Thats fun too! Whew!!
Kash| Hey Joey.
Joey| Hey Kash. Uh hey-hey this is Ross. Ross, this is Kash.
Kash| Hey.
Ross| Hi. I-I hear youre going on a ferry tonight.
Kash| Yeah.
Ross| A bit of a daredevil are we?
Rachel| (entering from her room) Hey guys do you think this is too
sluttyHi Kash!
Kash| Hey Rachel! You ready to go?
Rachel| Yeah! All right, Ill see you guys later.
Ross| Okay. Have a great time you guys.
Rachel| Thank you.
Kash| Thank you.
Ross| Yes it is too slutty! (Joey slams the door before Rachel could hear the
entire sentence.)
[Scene| Central Perk, Phoebe is reading a magazine as Tim enters.]
Tim| (walks behind Phoebe) Hi! (And startles her.)
Phoebe| Hi.
Tim| Oh, Im so glad you called. I feel like its always me calling
you. So, whats up? Is everything okay with Phoebe?
Phoebe| It will bein a minute. Listen, Tim youre a really great guy.
Tim| Its because Im with you.
Phoebe| Aw. (Phoebe gets a bad taste in her mouth when he looks away) Im
justIm in a place in my life right now where II
Tim| Whoops. Sorry. (Looking at it, like a newscaster) This just in. (Phoebe
fake laughs.) Oh, its 9-1-1 from the restaurant, that means Monica needs me right
away. (Starts to leave.)
Phoebe| Oh-oh no she doesnt! I know what that is. You can stay.
Tim| Awww, Ill miss you too Pheebs. (Starts to leave) And I will be
holding you, right here. (Holds his hands over his heart, blows a kiss to Phoebe who
catches it, and then leaves and Phoebe throws the kiss back.)
[Scene| Joey and Rachel's, Joey and Ross are having dinner.]
Joey| So what movie do you want to seeAnd not another one I have to read.
Okay? I get enough of that from books.
Ross| Books?
Joey| All right, car magazines, cereal boxes, but its like enough!
Ross| Well, I tell you what. Why dont we uh, why dont we just stay
here? Lets not see a movie, well just hang.
Joey| And just wait for Rachel to come back from her date?
Ross| Hey, if thats what you want to do Im not gonna say no.
Joey| Dude! What is going on?!
Ross| I justI have to find out how it went.
Joey| Why?
Ross| This guy could be my babys stepfather!
Joey| They go on one date and youre worried about them getting married?!
Hes not you!
Ross| I justI-I cant believe shes-shes dating?!
Joey| Well Ross, what did you think she was gonna do?
Ross| I dont know! I guess I just cant believe any of this is
happening.
Joey| What do you mean?
Ross| Its just I always thought when I had another kid it would be
different. Now I-I love Ben, but every time I have to drop him off at Carol and
Susans, its likeIt breaks my heart a little. I mean Ive always had
this picture of me and my next wife in bed on Sunday and, my kid comes running in and
leaps up onto the bed. And we all read the paper together. Yknow? Maybe fight over
the science section.
Joey| Thats a nice picture. Maybe you can still have that!
Ross| No! No I cant. I mean Rachels out with some guy. My baby went
with her. If anything that picture keeps moving further away.
Joey| Hey, can I ask you something? In this, in this picture of you and your
wife, is your wife Rachel?
Ross| It used to be. Now she doesnt really have a face. Smokin body
though.
Joey| Good call. Yeah. But, the face Ross, the face isnt Rachel.
Ross| No but ahh! How much easier would it be if it were?
Joey| I know, but I dont think thats what she wants.
Ross| No, its not what I want either. I mean I-I cant force myself
to fall in love with her again now.
Joey| Thats okay Ross maybe you need a new picture. Okay? Its not
gonna be what you thought, but no matter what theres gonna be a brand new little
baby, your baby. Who cares what the picture looks like?
Ross| Yeah.
Joey| Hey, I tell you what. Lets you and me go out and have some fun. Huh?
Whatever you want. Come on!
Ross| (checks his watch) We can still catch that Ukrainian film.
Joey| No, I said fun!
[Scene| Outside Chandlers Office, Chandler is just about to go into his office
when Bob calls for him from behind.]
Bob| Hey Toby!
Chandler| Hey Bobby.
Bob| Its Bob actually. Hey, you work up here, can you tell me where this
Chandler Bings office is?
Chandler| Uhh yeah. Yeah, its (Points down the hall) right, right down
there. (When he has Bob looking down the hall, he turns around and knocks his nameplate
off of his door.) Right there, yeah. Can I ask you why?
Bob| I want to talk to that bastard, see what his problem is.
Chandler| Okay Bob listen uhh, Im the reason you didnt get the job
up here.
Bob| Toby dont.
Chandler| Bob!
Bob| Toby! Im not gonna let you cover for him. Anything you say right now
will just get me more upset with Chandler!
Chandler| Well that puts me in a difficult position.
[Scene| Monicas Restaurant Kitchen, Monica is waiting for Tim who enters.]
Monica| Hey.
Tim| I got your page, is everything okay?
Monica| Uh well that depends, how are things with Phoebe?
Tim| Oh its great! Its great! Thank you so much for introducing us!
Monica| Oh my pleasure. Okay, Im afraid Ive got some bad news.
(Phoebe enters.) Phoebe!
Phoebe| Monica!
Monica| (simultaneously) Youre fired!
Phoebe| (simultaneously) Im breaking up with you!
Tim| What?
Phoebe| Im, Im breaking up with you.
Monica| Youre fired.
Tim| Why?
Phoebe| Im sorry, Im justImIm just not ready
for a relationship right now.
Monica| Yeah and-and Im sorry too. But, well I justI like things
done a certain way and the chemistrys just not right.
Phoebe| Oh thats good, the chemistry thing for us too.
Tim| Wow! Umm, okay. Umm (To Phoebe) I-I-I realize I came on a little
strong but, its only because I think youre so amazing. (To Monica) And uh, I-I
just wanna, I just wanna tell you how much I appreciate you giving me an opportunity here
because Iyoure the most talented chef Ive ever worked for. Anyway
(Starts to leave and Phoebe and Monica trade looks.)
Monica| Tim wait!
Tim| Yeah?
Monica| Umm, I think I spoke too quickly. There-theres a learning curve
with this job and maybe we can try it again.
Tim| Really?
Monica| Yeah.
Tim| Thank you so much! Cause I-I know I can do better!
Monica| Okay.
Phoebe| And Tim I just wanna say, good luck here. (Shakes his hand and leaves,
which disgusts Monica.)
[Scene| A Street, Ross is walking past a newsstand and sees Rachel.]
Ross| Hello.
Rachel| Hi!
Ross| Well, how was the date?
Rachel| Well Im alone and I just bought fifteen dollars worth of candy
bars, what do you think?
Ross| Uh-huh. What happened?
Rachel| I made the mistake of telling him that I was pregnant.
Ross| Ah, he didnt uh, take it so well?
Rachel| Well better than you, but yknow still not what you want.
Ross| Oh?
Rachel| He got all weird and sputtery and then he said uh, "Yeah, I hear
those hemorrhoids are a bitch."
Ross| He sounds swell.
Rachel| Doesnt he?
Ross| Hey, wannawanna a little cheering up?
Rachel| Yes.
Ross| Sit down.
Rachel| Okay.
Ross| Guess whose middle name is Muriel.
Rachel| (thinks then gasps) Chandler M. Bing?
Ross| Yeah-ha!
Rachel| Oh my God. (Laughs)
Ross| Im sorry about your date.
Rachel| Oh its all right. Im guess Im just done with the whole
dating thing. Its one more thing in my life thats suddenly completely
different. This is hard.
Ross| Yeah I know. (Pause) On the other hand in um, in about seven months
youre gonna have something that youre gonna love more than any guy youve
ever gone out with. Just wait. Wait until uh, wait until the first time your baby grabs
your finger. You have no idea.
Rachel| Thanks sweetie.
Ross| You wanna, you wanna grab some coffee?
Rachel| Oh no, I think Im gonna go home and eat ten candy bars.
Ross| Hey, I thought I cheered you up.
Rachel| Oh you did, there are twenty in here.
Ross| Right. Good night.
Rachel| Good night.
[Scene| Central Perk, Ross is entering and Mona from the wedding recognizes him.]
Mona| Ross?
Ross| Yeah?
Mona| Hey its Mona! From the wedding.
Ross| Oh hi!
Mona| Hi!
Ross| Wow! Uhhow are you?
Mona| Im good except umm, you still owe me a dance.
Ross| Oh thats right. Well uh, would you be interested in seeing a
Ukrainian film?
Mona| (laughs then stops) Oh youre serious. Sure!
Ross| Great! Well umm
Mona| I think I might need one more cup of coffee.
Ross| Sure! Uh, let me get it for ya.
Mona| Okay.
[Scene| Chandlers Office, Bob is ransacking Chandlers office.]
Chandler| (entering) Bob. Bob! Bob!!! (He turns around) What the hell are you
doing?!
Bob| I just found out this is Chandlers office! Come on Toby, give me a
hand!
[Scene| Central Perk, everyone is there as Chandler and Monica enter. Oh, and Joey is
wearing a FDNY T-shirt to make this the first nod to the tragedy that Friends have made.]
Monica| Hey you guys?
Ross| What?
Monica| I know its last minute, but we decided to have a Halloween party.
Phoebe| Oh good! (And theres general excitement.)
Monica| And everybody has to wear costumes. (And theres general
disconcertment.) Come on! Itll be fun!
Ross| Well, Ill-Ill be there. I mean I have to wear a costume to all
my classes that day anyway so
Rachel| Please tell me youre not gonna dress up like a dinosaur.
Ross| (exhales sarcastically) Not two years in a row.
Joey| Look, Ill come to the party but Im not dressing up.
Monica| You have to!
Joey| No way! Look, Halloween is so stupid! Dressing up, pretending to be
someone youre not
Chandler| Youre an actor!
Monica| So Ross, are you gonna bring Mona?
Ross| Yeah. Yeah, I think I will.
Joey| That hot girl from their wedding?
Ross| Yeah.
Joey| Well hey-hey if she needs any idea for costumes, she could be a bikini
model, or a slutty nurse, or a sexy cheerleader huhOoh-ooh, Leatherface from The
Texas Chainsaw MassacreNo-no-no! Slutty Leatherface.
Phoebe| Now wasnt Joey hitting on her at the wedding too?
Ross| Thats right! He was hitting on her, and I got her. I guess
the better man won. (To Joey) Please dont take her from me.
[Scene| A Street, Phoebe is walking down it and passes Ursula.]
Phoebe| Ursula! (Ursula turns, smiles, and continues walking.) Wait! Err-err,
its me! Phoebe!
Ursula| Oh, I thought there was a mirror there. Okay, bye-bye. (Starts to walk
again.)
Phoebe| Wait a second! So, whats new with you?
Ursula| Umm, nothing. I mean, Im getting married next week.
Phoebe| What?!
Ursula| Yeah! Yeah, its gonna be a small ceremony. Just family. (Phoebe
looks at her.) His.
Phoebe| Huh. Okay. Well, Im really happy for you. (Starts to walk away.)
Ursula| Wait! If umm, if you want to come, I guess thatd be okay.
Phoebe| Really?
Ursula| Sure! Why not? You could be my sister for the day.
Phoebe| Yeah. Okay. Umm, yknow, my friends are having a Halloween party
tonight at my old apartment so, you could come. Maybe I could meet the guy youre
marrying.
Ursula| Huh. Well, Im supposed to be working at the restaurant tonight.
Im supposed to be working right now, so who cares.
Phoebe| By the way, its a costume party.
Ursula| Oh! Okay, so thats why youre (Motions to what
shes wearing.)
Phoebe| (looks down) No. But thanks. (Walks away.)
[Scene| Monica and Chandler's, The Halloween party has started. Monica is setting out
some food as Rachel enters.]
Rachel| Hi!
Monica| Wait! Youre supposed to wear a costume!
Rachel| I am! I am a woman who spent a lot of money on a dress and she wants to
wear it, because soon she wont be able to fit into it.
Monica| Oh.
Rachel| Ahh!
Monica| Im Catwoman, who wants to borrow the dress when youre too
big for it.
Rachel| Okay.
Kids| Trick or treat!
Rachel| Oh! Oh! Can I give out the candy? I really want to be with the kids
right now. Yknow, ever since I got pregnant I-I have the strongest maternal
instincts.
Kids| Trick or treat!!
Rachel| (to them) Just a minute!!! (She takes the candy and opens the door to
two parents, a witch, a clown, and a cowgirl.) Look at you guys! Wow! You are a very scary
witch. (Gives her candy.)
Witch| Thank you.
Rachel| And you are a very funny clown. (Gives him candy.)
Clown| Thank you.
Rachel| (to the cowgirl) And you are so in style right now. Yknow, I work
at Ralph Lauren and the whole fall line has got this like equestrian theme going
on. I dont suppose you saw the cover of British Vogue, but
Cowgirl| (interrupting) Can I just have the candy?
Rachel| Yeah. Sure. (Throws some in her bag and she walks away as Phoebe,
dressed as Supergirl walks up and eyes Monica who eyes her back.)
Phoebe| Ah, Catwoman. So we meet again.
Monica| So we do Supergirl.
Phoebe| No, its me. Phoebe!
Chandler| (entering from the bedroom wearing a big, pink bunny costume) Monica!
Can I talk to you for a second? Listen, I appreciate you getting me the costume
Rachel| (To Monica) Oh, you did this to him?
Monica| What?! I thought hed love it! His favorite kid's book was the Velveteen
Rabbit!
Chandler| The Velveteen Rabbit was brown and white!
Monica| Well, it was either a pink bunny or no bunny at all.
Chandler| No bunny at all!! Always no bunny at all!!!
Joey| (entering) Hey!
Monica| You didnt dress up either?!
Joey| Yes I did! Im Chandler. (Looks at Chandler) Dude, what happened?
Chandler| How is that me?
Joey| Okay. Im Chandler (makes a growling/gurgling sound at the end and
the girls laugh.)
Phoebe| (To Chandler) That is so you!
Chandler| When have I ever done that?!
Joey| When have I ever done that?! (And does the sound again.)
Girl| Trick or treat!
Rachel| Oh! (Opens the door to reveal a ballerina) Well youre just the
prettiest ballerina Ive ever seen.
Ballerina| Thank you. (Pirouettes.)
Rachel| Oh wow! That deserves another piece of candy.
Ballerina| Thank you. (Does another ballerina move.)
Rachel| Well, I have to say that earns tutu pieces of candy.
Ballerina| I love you! (Hugs Rachel.)
Rachel| Ohh Oh, honey here. Take it all. (Pours the entire large bowl into
her bag and closes the door.) Monica! We need more candy?
Monica| What?! Theres only been like four kids.
Rachel| Yeah I know, but one of them just said that she loved me so I just gave
her everything.
Phoebe| No wonder your pregnant.
Ross| (entering) Hey! (Hes wearing a costume as well.)
Rachel| Hey.
Monica| What are you supposed to be?
Ross| Remember the Russian satellite, Sputnik? (They all look at him.) Well,
Im a potato or aspud. And these are my antennae. (Points to the colander with
an old TV antenna glued on top that hes wearing.) So Sputnik, becomes
(Theyre still confused) Spud-nik. Spudnik!
Chandler| Wow! I dont have the worst costume anymore!
Joey| (sees Ross) Hey all right, Ross came as doody.
Ross| No, I-Im not doody.
Monica| No, space doody!
Eric| Arent you gonna give me a kiss?
Phoebe| Okay, I will. But right after you tell me who the hell you are.
Eric| Ursula?
Phoebe| Ursulas fiancée?
Eric| Oh my God, youre the sister!
Phoebe| Yeah.
Eric| Okay, I just slapped my future sister-in-laws ass.
Phoebe| Yeah.
Eric| Im an idiot. Uh, is your mother here? Maybe I can give her a little
slap on the butt.
Phoebe| My mother killed herself.
Eric| She, now I knew that andnow Im sweating. Look at me, Im
really sweatingNow Im saying, "Look at me," Im getting even
sweatier. I think I probably should go.
Phoebe| No-no! Thats okay, well just start over. Okay? Hi! Im
Phoebe.
Eric| Eric. (They shake hands and hes squinting. And, no, its not
me.)
Phoebe| Why are you looking at me like that?
Eric| Cause the sweats getting in my eyes and its burning.
Phoebe| Okay. (Hands him a napkin.) So, what are you?
Eric| I dont think they have a name for it. Its just I get nervous;
I start sweating like crazy.
Phoebe| (laughs) No I-I meant your costume.
Eric| Oh umm, Im the solar system. (Hes wearing a black sweater with
the planets glued on around the sun.) Yeah, my students helped me make itI teach the
second grade.
Phoebe| I love the second grade!
Eric| Really?
Phoebe| Yeah! Its so much better than first grade when you dont know
whats going on and definitely better than third grade. Yknow with all
the politics and mind games.
Eric| So what do you do?
Phoebe| Umm, Im a masseuseby day. (Stands with her hands on her hips
like a Supergirl pose.)
Eric| Yknow you dont have to stand here with me, believe me
Phoebe| No Im having fun. Im reallyAnd Im really-really
excited for you and Ursula.
Eric| Oh I feel very lucky, shes great. I think shes the most
beautiful woman Ive ever seen.
Phoebe| Thank you.
Monica| Hey Joey?
Joey| Yeah.
Monica| You read comic books right?
Joey| Exclusively.
Monica| Who do you think would win in a fight, Catwoman or Supergirl?
Joey| Catwoman, hands down.
Monica| Yeah
Joey| But between you and Phoebe, Id have to give the edge to Phoebe.
Monica| What?! Really?!
Joey| Are you kiddin? Phoebe lived on the street. Okay? Plus, shes
got this crazy temper. SheShes not standing right behind me is she?
Monica| No youre fine. (Joey checks anyway.) All right well, do you think
I could take Rachel?
Joey| Im not sure.
Monica| What?! Come on I am tough! Punch me right here! (Her stomach) As hard as
you can!
Joey| Will you relax?! What are you taking this so seriously for? It
doesnt matter.
Monica| Oh really? Okay? Well what would you say if I told you that,
yknow, Ross or Chandler could beat you up?
Joey| I would say, "Woman, please!"
Phoebe| (walking over) Hey. Ursulas fiancée is really sweet!
Hes a teacher, he does all this volunteer work. Yknow normally yknow, I
dont like really sweaty guys. But this one? I could just mop him up!
Monica| Oh my God, Phoebe!
Phoebe| What?
Monica| Youre getting a crush on your sisters fiancée.
Phoebe| No Im not! You are!
Joey| (To Monica) Here comes the temper.
Girl| Trick or treat!
Rachel| Hi! Yknow what honey, were actually out of candy right now.
But someone just went out to get some and I have been giving out money but Im
out of that too. Hey, can I write you a check?
Girl| Okay!
Rachel| Okay, whats your name?
Girl| Lelani Mayolanofavich.
Rachel| Okay, Im just gonna write this out to cash.
Mona| (entering) Hi!
Rachel| Hey Mona!
Chandler| Oh! Hi!
Mona| Hi!
Chandler| Joeys gonna be thrilled! He was hoping youd come by as a
slutty nurse.
Mona| Umm, actually Im just a nurse.
Chandler| Youd think that would embarrass me, but you see Im maxed
out.
Ross| Hey!
Mona| Hi!
Ross| You made it!
Mona| Wait-wait! Youre umm, youre a potato
Ross| Well, Im a spud
Mona| And the antennaeOh my God youre Spudnik!
Ross| Yes!
Chandler| (To Ross) Marry her.
Joey| Okay, heres a good one for ya. Who do think would win in a fight
between Ross and Chandler.
Monica| I cant answer that! Chandlers my husband.
Joey| So Ross?
Monica| Yeah.
Eric| Hey beautiful.
Phoebe| Hello handsome. (Sees Ursula over her shoulder) Oh God. (Walks away in
shame as they kiss.) Oh look at you two. So when did you guys meet?
Eric| Two weeks ago.
Phoebe| Two weeks? Thats it?
Eric| Yeah, I know it sounds crazy, and its not like me to do something so
impulsive, but shes just so perfect, and we have so much in common.
Phoebe| Oh really?
Eric| Were both teachers.
Phoebe| Huh? (Ursula motions for Phoebe to keep quiet.)
Eric| And we were both in the Peace Corps.
Phoebe| Peace Corps, really? (Ursula motions, "I dont know.")
Eric| In fact when we were building houses in Uruguay, we were, we were just two
towns apart and we never met.
Ursula| Yeah. It wasnt a town when I got there, but it was a town when I
left. (To Eric) Shall we get me really drunk?
Eric| Sure.
Chandler| Howdy doody.
Ross| Thats funny. Yeah. Yknow youre the funniest man here in
a pink bunny costume his wife made him wear.
Chandler| Oh relax man, relax. Youre looking a little flushed.
Joey| (To Monica) Hey-hey-hey, I think we might find out the answer to our
question.
Chandler| What question?
Joey| Monica and I were talking about who could kick whose ass in a fight, you
or Ross?
Chandler| Theres no question.
Joey| So you think Ross too?
Chandler| (To Monica) You picked Ross?!
Monica| Ross is really strong! Okay, hes the strongest out of all three of
you! (Joey looks at her.) Except for Joey.
Chandler| I cannot believe you didnt pick me.
Ross| Uh, in her defense, shes right. I am stronger. I would destroy you.
Chandler| Oh really?! You think youre stronger? Why dont you prove
it? (He pushes Ross who starts to fall backwards until Mona catches him.)
Ross| Oh Ill prove it! Ill prove it like a theorem!!
Monica| Wait-wait!! Okay, stop it! Stop it! Stop! (Breaks it up.) Now listen, no
ones gonna fight in this apartment.
Joey| Hey Monica! (Grabs her and pulls her into the living room.) People came to
see a fight, lets give em what they came for!
Mona| Hey, you guys could arm wrestle.
Joey| Yeah. Listen to the slutty nurse.
Chandler| (To Ross) Youre going down.
Ross| Oh yeah? Youre going further down! Downtown!
Joey| Seriously guys, the trash talk is embarrassing.
[Scene| Monica and Chandler's, the party continues with Rachel leaning on the counter
as Gunther walks in carrying candy.]
Rachel| Oh Gunther! You brought candy! Thank you so much for picking this up!
You are so sweet.
Gunther| Really?
Rachel| Honey, someday you are gonna make some man the luckiest guy in the
world.
Kid| Trick or treat!
Rachel| Gotta go! (Opens the door to a boy in a cape.) Hi! Wow! There you go!
(Hands him some candy.)
Boy in the Cape| My friend Lewis told me you were giving out money.
Rachel| Oh yeah, we were but umm, now weve got candy.
Boy in the Cape| Id rather have the money.
Rachel| Well, that-thats not your choice. Happy Halloween!
Boy in the Cape| This isnt fair.
Rachel| Well is it fair that all you did was put on a cape and I gotta give you
free stuff?
Boy in the Cape| Shut up!
Rachel| You shut up!
Boy in the Cape| You cant tell me to shut up!
Rachel| Uh, I think I just did. And uh-oh, here it comes again. Shut up!
Joey| Rach?
Rachel| (To Joey) Yeah I knowIm goodI got it! (Joey slowly
backs away.) (To the boy) Now wait a minute, Ive got one more thing I have to say to
youoh right! Shut up!
Boy in the Cape| Youre a mean old woman. (Runs away.)
Rachel| No! Wait no! Shut upI mean dont cry! Let me get my
checkbook! (Grabs her checkbook and runs after him.)
Monica| (To Chandler) Look honey, you dont have to do this, okay?
Its the strength you have inside that means the most to me. Youre loyal,
youre honest, and you have integrity! Thats the kind of strength that I want
in the man that I love!
Chandler| That means nothing to me. (To Ross) Come on!
[Scene| The Hallway, Phoebe is exiting Monica and Chandlers, and finds Ursula
standing in the hallway smoking.]
Phoebe| Hi liar!
Ursula| Hey!
Phoebe| Yknow the only reason hes marrying you is because he thinks
all the things you were saying about yourself were true.
Ursula| Well they could be true.
Phoebe| But theyre not!
Ursula| Yeah, its a fine line huh?
Phoebe| Why are you lying to him?
Ursula| I dont know. He said he did all this stuff and then I said I did
it too and he got so excited, it was really fun.
Eric| (entering) Honey?
Ursula| (waving the cigarette in Phoebes face) Its a filthy,
disgusting habit and I want you to quit now!
Eric| Shes helped so many people to quit smoking.
Ursula| Yknow, wed really better get going.
Eric| Oh right, youve got a church group meeting tonight.
Ursula| Right. (Walks down the stairs.)
Eric| (To Phoebe) Well, it was nice meeting you.
Phoebe| You too. And Ursula?! It was really nice meeting you tonight!!
Joey| (entering) Pheebs come on! Bunny vs. Doody! Were waiting! (They go
inside.) (To Chandler and Ross.) Okay. Okay guys, one match, winner take all. (They grasp
each others hand in preparation for battle.) Oh wait-wait! What does the winner get?
Ross| Pride.
Chandler| And dignity.
Joey| (laughing) Okay, if you say so. All right, ready? Set! Go!
[Time Lapse| the crowd has left and only Mona, Monica, Joey, and Phoebe are still
watching to see who will be able to move the others arm first. An event that has yet
to happen.]
Mona| (To Joey) Wow! Theyre both really strong.
Joey| Or equally weak.
Monica| (To Phoebe) Oh God!
Phoebe| Hmm?
Monica| Chandlers making his sex face.
Ross| (To Chandler) So, you gettin tired?
Chandler| Nope! I can do this all day.
Ross| Yeah? Me too. (Pause) Gettin a little tired though.
Chandler| God, Im exhausted.
Ross| Look this is starting to look really bad for me. Okay? Mona, Monas
standing right over there. (Looks behind him.) Oh God, shes talking to Joey! You
gotta let me win!
Chandler| No way! If anything youve gotta let me win! My wife thinks
Im a wimp!
Ross| Hey, at least you have a wife! I-I keep getting divorces and knockin
people up! And Im dressed as doody.
Chandler| Youre Spudnik.
Ross| Come on, who are we kidding? Im doody. Please? Shes
watchin.
Chandler| Fine. (He lets Ross win.) Oh no!
Ross| (celebrating) Oh yeah!
Mona| (clapping) Yay! My hero!
Joey| (to her) Youre a weird lady.
Eric| (entering) Hey. Ursula said she left her purse.
Phoebe| Oh.
Eric| (finds it) What a relief. It has all the numbers of the people in her
prayer chain.
Phoebe| Sure it does. Yeah, yeah.
Eric| Well, I guess Ill see you at the wedding. (Exits and Phoebe follows
him into the hall.)
Phoebe| Umm listen, I dont thinkI dont think Im gonna
make it to the wedding. So I just want to wish you all the luck in the world.
Eric| I think well be okay. Besides its so perfect and (whispering)
shes been saving herself for me.
Phoebe| Okay I cant let you do this! Shes lying to you.
Eric| What?
Phoebe| She is lying! And I bet I can prove it. Excuse me. (She grabs
Ursulas purse and starts going through it and finds some papers.) Okay. Okay.
YeahNot a prayer chain, but what looks like a detailed drawing of a bank floor plan.
(Holds up her nametag.) Okay, heres the nametag from the restaurant where she works
as a waitress! Not a teacher, a waitress. All right, heres her driver license, this
oughta be good, she always lies about this. How old did she say she was?
Eric| She told me she was 25.
Phoebe| Oh, I almost dont want to show this. (Hands it to him.) Just
remember Im a minute younger.
Eric| I am so stupid. Of course she was lying! Shes not a teacher.
Theres not such a thing as the top secret elementary school for the children of
spies.
Phoebe| No. Youre not, youre not stupid.
Eric| Im not smart. (Phoebe has no comeback.) I just wanted so much
tobe impulsive once. To be romantic.
Phoebe| Thats good, you should be impulsive and you should be romantic.
Justyou did it with the wrong person. (He looks at her.) What?
Eric| Its just so weird, two people look so much alike, and so different.
Ursula| (yelling from downstairs) Eric!! Lets go!!
Eric| Id better go, deal
Phoebe| Yeah, you should. (They shake hands.)
Ursula| Hurry up I gotta pray!!
[Time Lapse| Rachel is returning from chasing down the boy in the cape.]
Joey| Hey!
Rachel| Hey! Well, I had to give the kid fifty bucks to stop crying.
Joey| Thats not so bad.
Rachel| No, I also had to go to a couple houses with him as his girlfriend. Oh,
I am just awful with children!
Joey| Come on! Youre good with kids. Theyre just crazy on Halloween.
Yknow, theyre all greedy and hopped up on sugar!
Rachel| Really? You think thats all it is?
Joey| Absolutely! Halloween is the worst. Except for Christmasand their
birthdays. Kinda get a little crazy during the summer too. And anytime theyre hungry
or sleepy. Yknow, kids are tough. Good luck with that. (Walks away.)
[Scene| Monica and Chandler's, Chandler and Monica are standing in the kitchen.]
Monica| Look, I wanted to tell Im-Im sorry you lost.
Chandler| Listen, Ive got a secret for ya. I let him win.
Monica| (laughs) Is that a secret or a lie.
Chandler| No, I let him winRoss!
Ross| Yeah?
Chandler| Would you tell her I let you win please?
Ross| Oh. Yeah. (Sarcastically) Uh Chandler let me win. No,
Chandlers really strong. Oh my arm is so sore. Oh nurse! (Waddles over to Mona.)
Chandler| I am strong! Ill show you! (He sits down at the table.)
Monica| Chandler please!
Chandler| Oh whats the matter? Are you scared?
Monica| Lets go big bunny!
Chandler| Okay. 123Go! (Once again hes at a stalemate,
but this time hes in pain.) (Pause) Im gonna kill myself!

Dutch Phrases by
[Scene| Monica and Chandler's, Chandler is sitting in the living room as Monica
enters.]
Monica| Hey.
Chandler| Hey.
Monica| Oh my God! You cleaned! (Gasps) Look at these floors! You did the
windows! Oh, I have been begging you for months and you did! You cleaned! And nagging
works!
Chandler| Yknow uh, I didnt actually do this.
Monica| Oh no, was I cleaning in my sleep again?
Chandler| No, it wasnt you.
Monica| Well then who?
Chandler| I got a maid. Yay!
Monica| (shocked) I hope by maid you mean mistress, because if some other woman
was here cleaning then
Chandler| Uh honey, I know you dont like to relinquish control
Monica| Oh, relinquish is just a fancy word for lose!
Chandler| Look, shes really nice. Okay? And she mentioned that she adored
the way that you arranged the sponges.
Monica| Did she really say that?
Chandler| Yes, I distinctly remember cause I thought it was a joke. Now
just give her a chance, okay?
Monica| Fine, I can do it. (Gets anxious.) Whew.
Chandler| Whats the matter?
Monica| Well, usually when Im this anxious, I clean!
[Scene| Central Perk, Ross, Rachel, and Phoebe are there as someones cell phone
starts to ring with one of those fancy ring tones.]
Phoebe| (looking around) Whos cell phone is that? Its just so
annoying; everywhere you go.
Ross| I think its coming from your bag.
Phoebe| (checks) I never get calls!! (Answers the phone) Hello?
Eric| Hi, its Eric. From the Halloween party, Ursulas fiancée.
Phoebe| Oh my God Eric hi! Wait, howd you get this number?
Eric| Oh, I have a friend whos a cop and he got it for me.
Phoebe| Wow! What an incredible violationand wonderful surprise.
Eric| Uh listen, I justI thought you should know I broke up with Ursula.
Phoebe| Oh you did? (To Rachel) He did it! He did it!
Rachel| Wow! What did he do?
Phoebe| Shhh! Im talking.
Eric| Anyway, I was wondering if, you were the sort of person whoeats
lunch.
Phoebe| Are you asking me out? Cause it would be kinda weird since you
just broke up with my sister.
Eric| Yeah uhokay. Im-Im sorry. Bye.
Phoebe| No! Wait! I was just saying that so youd think I was a good
person. Fight for me.
Eric| Uhh, I wont take no for an answer.
Phoebe| Not great, but we can work on it at lunch. Okay, I can be at your
apartment in two hours.
Eric| Great! But wh-whHow do you know where I live?
Phoebe| Ive got friends too. Okay, bye.
Eric| Bye.
Phoebe| Oh my God! Im going out with Eric! Ooh, this day is really gonna
be so much better than I thought it was gonna be. Oh Ross, I cant make lunch.
(Exits.)
Ross| So apparently Im available for lunch.
Rachel| I cant. Im busy. Im apartment hunting.
Ross| Youre moving?
Rachel| Yeah, I cant live with Joey once the baby comes. I dont want
my childs first words to be, (in a babys voice) "How you
doin?"
Ross| So does-does Joey know youre moving?
Rachel| Well, I havent discussed it with him yet, but I know hes
gonna be relieved. Last week, he brought this girl over and I started talking to her about
morning sickness and then I showed her pictures from my pregnancy book.
Ross| Thats not really porn.
Rachel| Not so much.
Ross| Hey, yknow what and if youre looking for a place? I just heard
in the elevator this morning that a woman in my building died.
Rachel| Oh my God! Was she old? Does she have a view?
Ross| Well I dont know, but how-how great would that be huh? You living in
my building. I could help take care of the baby. I can come over whenever I want. (Rachel
looks at him.) With your permission.
Rachel| Yeah that would really be great.
Ross| Yeah.
Rachel| Well can we see it?! Oh maybe we shouldnt. I mean if she just died
this morning out of respect.
Ross| Yeah. No. No youre right.
Rachel| Shall we?
Ross| Yeah.
[Scene| Rosss Building, they are approaching the apartment of the woman who died.
Ross knocks on the door and a woman answers it.]
Mrs. Verhoeven's Daughter| Yes?
Ross| Hi. Im Ross Geller. I live in the building.
Rachel| And Im Rachel, an admirer of the building.
Ross| I-I heard about Mrs. Verhoeven passing away and Im so sorry for your
loss.
Mrs. Verhoeven's Daughter| She didnt pass.
Ross| What?
Mrs. Verhoeven's Daughter| My mothers still alive.
Ross| Oh, thank God!
Mrs. Verhoeven's Daughter| It looked like we were gonna lose her this morning,
but shes a tough old bird.
Rachel| Ahh.
Mrs. Verhoeven's Daughter| Are you close with her?
Ross| Of course! Uh yeah, she and I would talk all the time in-in (Rachel pokes
her head in and starts to look around) the laundry room. (Pushes Rachel out of the way.)
Ross| Yknow I would its just painful.
Rachel| So shes really not dead.
Mrs. Verhoeven's Daughter| No, shes hanging in there.
Rachel| Hmm. Do you thinkCould you tell me if shes hanging in, in a
one bedroom or a two?
[Scene| Monica and Chandler's, Monica is observing the new maid, Brenda, clean.]
Brenda| Mrs. Bing, this tile cleaner is incredible! Whered you get it?
Monica| Oh well umm, I make it myself! Its two parts ammonia and one part
lemon juice. And now the secret ingredient isyknow what? We just met.
Brenda| Okay. Uhh, Im gonna go get the clothes from the laundry room now.
And, when I come back Ill clean behind the refrigerator.
Monica| (To Chandler) I love her.
Brenda| Ill be back in a minute.
Monica| Okay. (As Brenda exits Monica notices something.)
Chandler| See? I told you.
Monica| She stole my jeans!
Chandler| (pause) What?
Monica| I have been looking for them all week and she is wearing them!
Chandler| So she stole your pants and then she came back and wore them in front
of you?
Monica| Dont you see? Its the perfect crime!
Chandler| She mustve been planning this for years!
Monica| I will prove it to you! Okay? About a week ago I was wearing those jeans
and I dropped a pen in my lap and it left an ink stain on the crotch. Now when she comes
back I will find it and show you that stain!
Chandler| Honey, isnt it possible that the company that sold the jeans
made more than just the one pair?
Monica| I guess.
Chandler| So, shouldnt we go give her the benefit of the doubt before we
gosnooping around her crotch?
Monica| Fine. Im just glad I didnt give her my secret ingredient.
Chandler| Out of curiosity, what is your secret ingredient?
Monica| Yeah! (Laughs.)
[Scene| Erics Apartment, hes opening the door to reveal Phoebe.]
Phoebe| Hi!
Eric| Come in, Im so glad youre here.
Phoebe| Yeah, me too. Not in the shaky angry way you are though.
Eric| Sorry, I just saw Ursula. I had to give the engagement ring back.
Phoebe| Oh.
Eric| Just seeing her brought it all back. All the lies, the way she used me. I
justI got so angry just looking at her(Looks at Phoebe)face.
Phoebe| Yeah. (Covers her face with her hand.) Yeah.
Eric| Im sorry. I justwhen I look at you I see her. When I see her I
get a little bit angry.
Phoebe| Maybe this is too weird.
Eric| No wait! Theres only a problem when I look at you. (Sits down on the
couch.) Oh I got it! I got it. (Puts his hands to his eyes.)
Phoebe| No dont tear out your eyes!!
Eric| I was just, I was just gonna take out my lenses.
Phoebe| Oh, yeah try that. (He finishes and looks at her.) So, is that better?
Eric| Not really. Youyoure blurry, but you still look like Ursula.
Youre Blursula. Okay wait. MaybeIf I-if I just dont look at you for a
while. (Stands up and turns his back to her.) See? Itit works. Im not,
Im not angry at all anymore! This is a great date!
Phoebe| Look Eric, turn around. (He does so.) Look, I like you, but it
shouldnt be this hard. Yknow? This is our first date yknow? First
dates are supposed to be about excitement and electricity and Ooh, he just touched
my hand, did he mean to touch my hand? and yknow first kisses and(He
kisses her)second kisses. (Motions for him to kiss her again which he does and they
start to make out.)
[Scene| Central Perk, Ross is reading some book and Gunther serves him a cup of
coffee.]
Ross| Thanks for the coffee, or bedankt voor de koffie, Gunter. (He translates
that phrase into Dutch.)
Ross| Yeah, were done.
Ross| Ezel? Ezel? Ezel? (Looks it up in his book.)
Joey| (entering) Hey Ross! Listen, do you want to go see that new Imax movie on
tide pools?
Ross| Really?!
Joey| (laughs) No. But I got Knicks tickets for you, me, and Chandler.
Ross| Sweet!
Joey| All right, well finish your coffee; lets go.
Ross| Okay I-I just have to stop by my place first.
Joey| To tape the game? You do this every time Ross, youre not
gonna be on TV!
Ross| No-no, I-I have to see if this apartment became available.
Joey| Oh, youre switching apartments?
Ross| Its not for me, its for Rachel.
Joey| But Rachel has an apartment.
Ross| Yeah, but when the baby comes shes gonna want to move.
Joey| She is?
Ross| Yeah, you didnt expect her to live there with a baby did you?
Joey| I guess I didnt really think about it.
Ross| (finds the word in the book) Ezel! (Reads the translation.) Hey Gunther!
Youre an ezel!
Ross| Damnit!
[Scene| Monica and Chandler's, Brenda is sweeping and Monica is sitting at the kitchen
table.]
Monica| Nice jeans!
Brenda| Oh thanks! I like your top.
Monica| Oh. (Holds on to it.) (To herself) Youre not gettin it.
Brenda| What happened?!
Monica| Oh, I fell asleep.
Brenda| I was thinking about taking my lunch break.
Monica| Oh, will you do the top of the cabinets? Thatll really work up
your appetite for lunch.
Brenda| All right.
Monica| Hello.
Brenda| Whats going on?!
Monica| Im sorry. Ive never had a maid before, is this not okay?
[Scene| Joey and Rachel's, Rachel is eating pizza as Joey returns from the Knicks
game.]
Rachel| Hey!
Joey| Hey!
Rachel| How was the game?
Joey| Oh, okay. II ate way too much.
Rachel| Oh.
Joey| Ooh. (Notices the pizza, grabs a slice, and takes a bite.) So umm, I was
talkin to Ross and he said you were looking for a new place.
Rachel| Oh yeah! Hopefully across the street if certain Dutch people would just
let go.
Joey| I was kinda hoping youd stay.
Rachel| Oh but Joey, I have to go. Theres no room for a baby here.
Joey| No room? Its a baby. Its like this big. (Holds his hands about
a foot apart.) Yknow, I mean you-you could you could put it over here. (A desk.)
Or-or-or we could put it right here. (The chair.) Aw, its cute, right? Or-or we
could put it over here. (By the bathroom door.) You wouldnt even notice it.
Wheres the baby? (Mumbles that its over in the corner.)
Rachel| Honey, its not just a matter of where you put it. I mean a baby
changes everything. They cry all the time. I mean imagine bringing home some girl and
trying to score when theres a screaming baby around.
Joey| I could use a challenge! Its getting pretty easy.
Rachel| Honey, its so sweet that you want me to stay, but I-I cant
do that to you. I mean it would disrupt your entire life.
Joey| I love living with you so much. I just wish things didnt have to
change.
Rachel| I know.
Joey| Yknow I blame Ross for this.
Rachel| I do too a little bit.
Joey| Im gonna miss you, youre the hottest roommate I ever had.
[Scene| Erics Apartment, he and Phoebe are still making out.]
Phoebe| Ooh, oh no! I have to go! I have a massage appointment.
Eric| Oh no, stay here well keep doing this. Ill pay you.
Phoebe| No, I got in trouble for that before. Ill see you later.
Eric| Absolutely. (They kiss and Phoebe heads for the door.) I love the way you
kiss.
Phoebe| Really? Thats the thing Im worse at! Youll see.
(Exits.)
[Scene| Monica and Chandler's, Brenda is shaking out the rugs on the balcony as Monica
pouts in the living room.]
Chandler| (entering) Hi!
Monica| Hey! Umm, I think Brenda needs a raise.
Chandler| How come?
Monica| Because I put my head between her legs.
Chandler| To see her pants?
Monica| Theyre my pants!
Chandler| Are you sure? Did you see the stain?
Monica| No! I was just getting into position and then everything went dark.
Chandler| God! She is not stealing from us! Okay, will you let this go?
Monica| Fine. (Brenda comes in to use the bathroom and adjusts her pink bra
strap on the way.) Shes wearing my bra!
Chandler| Oh dear God!
Monica| My pink flowered bra! I recognize the strap!
Chandler| And yet you dont recognize that youre crazy.
Monica| Heres the plan! Okay? Im going to leave you get a look at
Brendas bra!
Chandler| Heres another planNo!
Monica| I would do it but she thinks Im attracted to her!
Chandler| Why?
Monica| Did you not hear where my head was? Come on! Come on were a
team! Were in this together!
Chandler| I fear a jury will see it the same way!
Monica| Do this for me! Come on, I catch you looking at womans breasts all
the time!
Chandler| You see that?
Monica| Do you see this? (Mimics him drooling over a womans breasts.)
Chandler| All right. Yes. Okay. I get your point. But if its not your bra
will you just let the woman clean the apartment?!
Monica| Yes! Absolutely. Okay? Look, youll know its mine because on
the right cup, the lacey part, theres a very noticeable rip.
Chandler| You need new clothes.
[Scene| Mrs. Verhoevens Apartment, Ross is back to inquire about the elder
Verhoevens health or lack there of.]
Ross| Hi. How is she?
Mrs. Verhoeven's Daughter| Its not looking good.
Ross| (happily) Oh. (Realizes then sadly) Oh. Well I uh, I brought her some
bloemen. (Flowers in Dutch.)
Mrs. Verhoeven's Daughter| Thats so sweet. (Takes the flowers.) Would you
like to come in and say good-bye? Im sure it would mean a lot to her.
Ross| Oh I dont know that it would.
Mrs. Verhoeven's Daughter| Well, her memory is pretty much gone.
Ross| All right then. (Follows her in and checks the place out.)
[Scene| Erics Apartment, hes resting on the bed as Phoebe enters.]
Phoebe| (entering) Hey!
Eric| Welcome back!
Phoebe| Hey! (Jumps on the bed with him.) Can we pick up where we left off?
Eric| I dont know, Im still pretty tired out from this afternoon.
Phoebe| Why?
Eric| Uh, the sex.
Phoebe| What sex?
Eric| Our sex.
Phoebe| We didnt have sex.
Eric| Well if I didnt have sex with you, I had sex with someone that
looked an awful lot like
Phoebe| (simultaneously as Eric) Ew! Ew! Ew! Ew! Ew! Ew!
Eric| (simultaneously as Phoebe) Oh no! Oh no! Oh no! Oh no! No! No! No!
Phoebe| You-youyou had sex with Ursula?!
Eric| Uh, a little bit. She-she-she walked in and I thought she was you and I
kissed her and
Phoebe| You didnt notice she was wearing different clothes?!
Eric| Well I was just so excited to see you.
Phoebe| Oh. Ew! Ew! Ew! Ugh! Yknow what? This is too weird.
Eric| No-no its not! I dont want to lose you! Its-its
like I was saying to Ursula when I was making love to her and I thought she was
youYeah it is too weird.
Phoebe| So I guess this is it.
Eric| Yeah. (They hug.) Maybe its for the best. You smell just like her.
Phoebe| Yeah, so do you.
[Scene| Monica and Chandler's, Brenda is wiping the coffee table and Chandler is trying
to look at her bra and leans over on the coffee table to get a good look.]
Brenda| (noticing him) What are you doing?
Chandler| Im leaning. This is where I lean.
Brenda| Okay. (Goes over and fluffs up the pillows on the couch.
Chandler| Brenda a bee!
Brenda| What?
Chandler| Yes! Its flown into your blouse and youd better undo your
buttons lest it sting you!
Brenda| I think I know whats going on here.
Chandler| You do?
Brenda| Look, I know it must be hard that your wife is a lesbian, but its
wrong. Youre married.
Chandler| I totally understand. (They both laugh.) Can I just see your
bra?
[Scene| The Hallway, Monica is sitting on the step as Rachel returns.]
Rachel| Hi!
Monica| (looking at Rachels jeans) Where did you get those jeans?!
Rachel| You gave them to me!
Monica| No I didnt!
Rachel| All right, I took them. But I figured it would be okay because you got a
big ink stain on the crotch.
Monica| Oh no! Did you take my bra too?!
Rachel| What bra?
Monica| The pink one with the flowers?!
Rachel| You mean the one that youre wearing? (Adjusts Monicas pink
bra strap as Monica looks down her shirt.)
Brenda| (entering) I quit! (Storms off.)
Monica| Sounds about right.
[Scene| Joey and Rachel's, Rachel enters and notices that Joey has set up a space for
the baby where the couch was, complete with a crib.]
Rachel| What is this?
Joey| Hey! Uh, this is just to give you an idea. Okay well, we can put screens
here, (In front of the crib.) so that the baby has privacy, and-and-and maybe a mobile
over the crib. And uhOh look! Heres a baby monitor (Holds it up), which until
the baby comes we can use as walkie-talkies. Huh?
Rachel| Youre so sweet. (Notices something in the crib.) Oh my God! And
you gave the baby Hugsy! (A stuffed penguin wearing a ski jacket, goggles, and hat.)
Joey| Ahhhhhhhhhhhh. That-that-thats really just to show where the
baby would go. Yknow why dont I hold on to him so that theres no
confusion? (Takes him back, sets him on the chair, and apologizes to him.)
Rachel| But Joey the baby is going to be crying, its going to be loud.
Joey| Im loud!
Rachel| Its gonna be up all night!
Joey| Im up all night!
Rachel| Its gonna poop!
Joey| Hello!
Rachel| What about all the women you want to bring home?
Joey| Look, if Im bringing home a woman who cant stand being around
a baby, then maybe I dont want to be with that woman! Or maybe well just do it
in the bathroom of the club!
Rachel| Joey, are you sure?
Joey| Yeah! All rightLook, I know sometimes itll be hard, okay? But,
itll also be reallyreally great. Please Rachel! I-I-I really want you to stay.
Rachel| I want me to stay too.
Joey| Ohh!
Rachel| Thank you. (They hug.) Oh Joey and look at this crib! Its so cute!
Joey| I know! I found it on the street.
Rachel| Are you seriousReally?! Its in such good condition.
Joey| Yeah.
Rachel| Wow! Whoa-whoa whats under the covers?
Joey| I dont know.
Rachel| Its moving.
Joey| Ew.
Rachel| Its still(Screams)Its got a tail! Get it out of
here! Get it out of here!!
Joey| Ooh! Ah! Okay! (Quickly drags the crib outside.)
[Scene| Joey and Rachel's, Joey and Rachel are toasting her staying put.]
Ross| Well, the old lady died. And how do I know? Her dying wish was for one
last kiss. But I dont care, (To Rachel) because you got the apartment. Yes!
Rachel| Ewww. Yeah. Umm. I think Im gonna stay here.
Joey| Isnt that great?
Ross| (stutters looking for words) Ezels!!

[Scene| Central Perk, Joey, Monica, and Chandler are sitting on the couch and chair as
Phoebe is getting coffee.]
Rachel| (coming from the bathroom) Hey Pheebs?
Phoebe| Huh?
Rachel| Im having dinner with my dad tomorrow night, do you wanna come?
Phoebe| Sure. Yeah, hes kinda sexy.
Rachel| Oh no, no, Ill be there too.
Phoebe| Okay so, well just come up with some kind of signal if its
going well you can take off.
Rachel| No Phoebe! I just need you there for support. I havent told him
Im pregnant yet.
Phoebe| Oh. Why not?
Rachel| Cause I know hes gonna flip out and I hate it when hes
angry.
Phoebe| Oh Rachel, this is all so Papa dont preach.
Rachel| What Phoebe? Wait! One time he caught me smoking he said if he ever saw
me doing that again hed make me eat the entire pack.
Phoebe| Wow! Oh well, I will be there!
Rachel| Thank you.
Phoebe| Gosh. Im not gonna let that man make you eat your baby. (They both
sit down by the rest of the gang and Phoebe recognizes a man by the window.) Oh. Hey! Who
is that guy? I think I know him.
Monica| (recognizing him and panicking) No you dont!
Rachel| (panicking) No you dont.
Phoebe| Oh my God!!! Monica!! Hes the stripper from your bachelorette
party!!
Chandler| Her what?!!
Phoebe| Your secret bachelorette party
Chandler| You had a bachelorette party?!
Phoebe| She untied his G-string with her teeth. (Pause) Somebody stop me!
Chandler| I thought we werent gonna have bachelor/bachelorette parties!
Yknow, we agreed that it was a silly tradition.
Joey| Its a grand tradition!
Monica| Im sorry, they surprised me. There was nothing I could do!
Rachel| Well you couldve untied it with your hands.
Joey| This is so unfair! The one thing I wanted to do was throw my best friend a
bachelor party, but no, I wasnt allowed to. All I got was a stupid steak dinner!
Chandler| You went home with the waitress.
Joey| Oh yeah, that was a pretty good night.
Chandler| I cant believe you didnt tell me! You know that the
two pillars of marriage are openness and honesty!
Monica| Ugh, I knew giving you that book was gonna come back and bite me
in the ass!
[Scene| A Restaurant, Rachel and Phoebe are having dinner with Dr. Green, and everyone
is looking at the menu.]
Dr. Green| How about I order everyone the Moroccan chicken?
Phoebe| Oh, I-I dont eat meat.
Dr. Green| Its chicken.
Phoebe| Yeah, I dont eat that either.
Dr. Green| Ill never understand you lesbians. (To Rachel) So baby, tell
mewhat is new with you.
Rachel| Well actually umm
Waiter| (interrupting) Your 74 Lafite sir.
Dr. Green| 74?! I ordered the 75! Thats a magnificent wine!
The 74 is sewage! Why would you bring me sewage?! (The waiters dumbfounded) Is
that a hard question? Are you an idiot? Is that why youre a waiter?
Waiter| This is why I told the manager I wouldnt wait on you tonight!
(Runs off.)
Dr. Green| Oh come on! Dont be such a baby! (Goes after him)
Rachel| (To Phoebe) In case you didnt notice, that is a scary man.
Phoebe| Hes right though, the 74 is absolute piss.
Rachel| This was such a huge mistake. I cant tell him Phoebe. I
cant, I cant, I cant, I cant
Phoebe| Rachel!
Rachel| No its okay, this is whats gonna happen. Im gonna wait
a couple years and then the baby will tell him.
Phoebe| Why, so he can get mad at the baby?
Rachel| Hey, that is thebabys problem. (Dr. Green returns.) Oh,
everything okay with the waiter?
Dr. Green| I have no idea, I went to the bathroom. So sweetie, you were starting
to tell me what is uh, what is new with you.
Rachel| Well Umm, I got TiVo.
Dr. Green| Whats TiVo?
Phoebe| Its slang for pregnant.
Rachel| Phoebe!
Dr. Green| Are you really pregnant?
Rachel| Well uh, yes and no. Except not no. So to sum it up, yeah.
Dr. Green| Who is the father? Oh no! Please dont tell me its her!
(Points at Phoebe.)
Rachel| No, its Ross. Its Ross. You like Ross. (He just shakes his
head.) Oh daddy, I hope youre okay with all of this. I mean think about it, this is
a good thing. Youre gonnaThis is your first grandchild! Youre gonna be a
poppy!
Dr. Green| Thats true.
Rachel| Yeah.
Dr. Green| (laughs) Poppy. (To Phoebe) Oh, Im gonna be a poppy. (Stops
laughing) So when is the wedding?
Rachel| Who?
Dr. Green| The wedding! Theres going to be a wedding. Young lady,
dont you sit there and tell me my first grandchild is going to be a bastard! (Rachel
pauses) Rachel Karen Green, tell me there is gonna be a wedding!!
Rachel| February 2nd!
[Scene| Central Perk, Chandler and Joey are reading a magazine and Ross is chatting
with Mona.]
Mona| So it was really cool seeing you lecture today.
Ross| Oh thanks. Although it kinda seemed like you were falling asleep there a
little.
Mona| Oh no-no, I-I had my eyes closed so I could concentrate and yknow
take it all in.
Ross| Yeah, a lot of my students do that.
Mona| So, I gotta get going.
Ross| Okay, I-Ill see you tonight.
Mona| Yeah.
Ross| Okay, bye.
Mona| Oh hey, thanks again for showing me your semi-precious stone collection.
It was amazing! (She leaves.)
Chandler| My God! You must be good in bed!
Joey| So uh, you and Mona, been a while now. Hows it going?
Ross| Ah, its good. Its going good. I mean, we get along great.
Shes, shes so
Joey| Hot?
Ross| Well, I was gonna say sweet, but yeah-huh!
Chandler| Shes okay with Rachel and the baby?
Ross| Well II havent actually told her yet. I dont want to
scare her off, yknow?
Chandler| Well, you have to honest with her! Otherwise you may think that
youre going down the same path, but youre really going down different ones.
Joey| Im gonna take that book and beat you to death with it.
Monica| (entering) Oh my God! You are gonna love me so much! I felt really bad
about the whole bachelorette party thing, so tonight youre gonna have a bachelor
party.
Chandler| What?
Monica| Yeah, I got this number from this guy at work and I hired a stripper to
come dance for you. Am I going in the wife hall of fame or what?!
Chandler| Honey! Thats crazy! I dont want you to get me a
stripper
Joey| Will you let the lady talk?!
Monica| Come on! Come on, itll be fun! Itll make me feel so much
better.
Chandler| Look, I appreciate it, but uh, its a little creepy. Yknow?
Im not a bachelor anymore.
Monica| So dont think of it as a bachelor party, think of it as aa
two month anniversary present.
Ross| Sure, one year is paper, but two months is lapdance! (Joey nods his
agreement.)
Monica| Please! I feel so bad! Just watch the hot woman get naked!
Chandler| All right fine! But Im only doing this for you!
Joey| Yeah!
Chandler| And Joey.
Monica| Thank you. All right, now who else do you want to invite?
Chandler| Ah, no-no-no just Ross. Ross and Joey is embarrassing enough.
Ross| Uh actually, sorry I cant even make it. Im seeing Mona again
tonight.
Joey| (on cell phone) Im sorry I gotta cancel tonight baby
[Scene| The Restaurant, dinner has ended and Phoebe and Rachel are talking. Dr. Green
is not at the table.]
Phoebe| Im sorry I wont be able to make it to your imaginary
wedding, but Im really busy that day. Yeah, I already have a unicorn baptism
and a leprechaun bar mitzvah.
Rachel| I know. I know. I panicked, I panicked. I didnt want him to start
yelling at me like I was some 74 Latour.
Phoebe| Its Lafite. The 74 Latour is actually drinking quite nicely.
Rachel| All right here he comes. Im gonna do this, Im gonna tell
him, Im gonna be strong.
Dr. Green| I just called a friend of mine.
Rachel| Yeah?
Dr. Green| I think I may be able to book The Plaza on short notice.
Rachel| Really?! The Plaza?!! Oh daddy!! (Hugs him and Phoebe glares at
her.) Right. Daddy, I need to talk to you. Please, sit down.
Dr. Green| What is it sweetie?
Rachel| Theres not gonna be a wedding. Ross and I are not getting married.
Dr. Green| What?!
Rachel| Im sorry daddy.
Dr. Green| I dont believe this!!
Rachel| Oh now daddy, stay calm. Please.
Dr. Green| Stay calm?!! How do you expect me to stay calm?! This is unacceptable
Rachel! And I wanna know why?!! Is it because that punk Ross wont marry you?!
Thats it! Is that it?!
Rachel| Yes. Yes, he says Im damaged goods.
[Scene| Monica and Chandler's, Chandlers bachelor party has begun, what there is
of it, with only Joey (wearing a gold paper top hat) and Chandler (wearing what appears to
be a Burger King paper crown) enjoying a nice product placement of Budweisers
on ice.]
Joey| So you uh, nervous about getting married?
Chandler| What are you doing?
Joey| Look, look lets pretend its a real bachelor party. Okay?
Yknow? Before your wedding. Come on, itll be fun.
Chandler| Okay. I cant believe tomorrows the big day.
Joey| How does it feel knowing youre never gonna be with another woman
again huh? Knowing youre gonna have to wake up to the same face everyday until you
finally have the sweet release of death.
Chandler| Youre right, this is more fun.
Joey| Thats her! Okay, come on! (They go over and open the door.)
Stripper| Hi!
Chandler| Hi. (Joey blows on a noisemaker.)
Stripper| So which one of you lucky boys is Chandler?
Joey| Uh, that-thats-thats me!
Chandler| Thats me.
Joey| Joey Tribbiani, a big fan.
Stripper| So is that a bedroom? (Points to the guestroom.)
Chandler| Yeah, yeah right over there.
Stripper| All right, whenever youre ready. (She goes into the bedroom.)
Chandler| That was weird.
Joey| Why-why would she go in the bedroom?
Stripper| Im waiting.
Chandler| So shes a
Joey| Yeah, thats one naked hooker!
[Scene| Ross's Apartment, Ross and Mona are sitting on the couch.]
Mona| I love your place! Where is this guy from? (A statue from the top of his
apothecary table.)
Ross| Uh thats an eighteenth century Indian artifact from Calcutta.
Mona| Oh wow! So, youre more than just dinosaurs.
Ross| So much more.
Mona| Oh my God! Oh my God! Im so sorry!
Ross| Aw forget it, its from Pier One. (Theres an angry knock
on the door.) Sorry. (Goes and opens the door to an irate Dr. Green.)
Dr. Green| You think you can knock up my daughter and then not marry her?!
Im gonna kill you!!
Ross| Yknow this is actually not a great time for me.
[Scene| Ross's Apartment, continued from earlier.]
Dr. Green| So? Come on! Explain yourself Geller! First you get my Rachel
pregnant!
Mona| You got Rachel pregnant?!
Ross| Who did?!
Dr. Green| You did!
Ross| Yes. Yes, yes I did. (To Mona) But-but it was, it was just a one night
thing. It meant nothing.
Dr. Green| Oh? Really? Thats what my daughter means to you? Nothing?
Ross| No! No sir umm, she means a lot to me. I mean, I careI-I love
Rachel.
Mona| What?!
Ross| (to Mona) Oh but not that way. I meanI mean Im not in love
with her. I love her like a, like a friend.
Dr. Green| Oh really? Thats how treat a friend? You get her in trouble and
then refuse to marry her?
Ross| (to Dr. Green) Hey! I offered to marry her!
Mona| Wh
Ross| (To Mona) But I didnt want to.
Dr. Green| Well why not? So you can spend your time with this tramp?!
Mona| Tramp?!
Ross| Im sorry. Dr. Green, Mona. Mona, Dr. Green.
[Scene| Monica and Chandler's, Chandler and Joey are discussing what to do about the
now naked hooker in the guestroom.]
Chandler| I cant believe there is a naked hooker in there!
Joey| Wait! Wait! Maybe shes a hooker and a stripper, but she got
confused about what shes supposed to do.
Chandler| Could be. I mean technically she did strip, we just, we just missed
it. (Walks towards the bedroom.) Maam, are you also a stripper?
Hooker| Uh, no. But I could pretend to strip, but thats gonna cost extra.
Okay, heres the extras, handcuffs, spanking (Chandler grunts for her not to
continue and Joey pulls him back into the kitchen.)
Joey| Maybe Monicas playing a joke on ya. Yknow? Getting her own
husband a hooker, thats pretty funny.
Chandler| That is funny, maybe for my birthday shell murder someone.
Joey| I bet Ross was in on it too. I mean he was conveniently busy.
Hooker| Do you mind if I smoke in here?
Chandler| Oh actually, Id rather youYeah, go ahead. Were gonna
have to burn that room down anyway.
[Scene| Ross's Apartment, continued from earlier.]
Mona| How could you have kept all of this from me?
Ross| I was going to tell you, but
Dr. Green| But what?! You figured youd get what you wanted and then dump
her like you dumped Rachel!
Ross| Hey! I did not dump Rachel! (To Mona) Nor are we still together. (The
phone rings and Ross goes to answer it, only hes trapped behind the apothecary table
by Dr. Green.) Can I just (Dr. Green glares at him.) Why dont we just let the
machine get that?
Joey| (on machine) Hey Ross. Its Joey. Theres a hooker over here and
we thought maybe youd know something about it.
Ross| No! No! No! No! No! I-I-I-II need to, I need to lie down.
[Scene| Monicas Restaurants Kitchen, shes cooking as one of her
waiters, Stu, comes over to talk to her.]
Stu| So, tonights the night of the big bachelor party?
Monica| Yeah! Hey! Thanks for getting me that girls number.
Stu| No problem. So whos the party for?
Monica| My husband.
Stu| You hired your husband a hooker?
Monica| Shes a stripper.
Stu| No, shes a hooker.
Monica| Is that, is that what they call strippers sometimes?
Stu| When theyre hookers.
Monica| Oh my God Stu! I-I cant believe you did this! Now are you
absolutely sure shes a hooker?
Stu| Either that or shes just the best, most expensive date I ever had.
[Scene| Monica and Chandler's, Joey and Chandler are still deciding what to do about
the hooker.]
Joey| Maybe she meant to get you a hooker.
Chandler| Why would she do that?
Joey| Maybe she wants you to learn something. Huh? Now is there anything
youre really bad at yknow, sexually?
Chandler| This is the worst bachelor party ever!
Hooker| Whats taking you boys so long?
Joey| In a minute!
Chandler| (To Joey) In a minute? Whats gonna happen in a minute?!
Joey| All right, all right maybe-maybe you should just ask her to leave.
Chandler| Why me?!
Joey| Hey! Its your bachelor party.
Chandler| Which is why you should do it.
Joey| I dont want to. You do it!
Chandler| You do it!
Joey| You do it!
Chandler| All right Rock, Paper, Scissors who has to tell the whore to leave!
(Joey smirks.) What?
Joey| I miss this.
Chandler| I dont think weve actually done this before!
Joey| No, I-I miss hanging out with you.
Chandler| Well wewe still hang out.
Joey| Not like we used to. Remember? You and me used to be inseparable.
Yknow now its likethings are different.
Chandler| Well yknow, things are different. ImIm married
now.
Joey| Oh sureAnd hey, dont get me wrong, I am so happy for you guys.
I justI misshanging outjust-just us, yknow?
Chandler| Yeah, I miss that too. I tell you what; from now on well make
time to hang out with each other.
Joey| You got it. Come here. (They hug and are observed by the hooker.)
Hooker| Oh God! Listen, I am this close to robbing you guys. (Does the close
sign.)
Monica| (entering quickly) Shes a hooker! Shes a hooker! Shes
a (Stops as she sees her.) Hi! Uh, we spoke on the phone. (Goes and shakes the
hookers hand.)
[Scene| Joey and Rachel's, Rachel and Phoebe are at the counter as Ross enters.]
Ross| So your dad dropped by. Hes a pleasant man!
Rachel| (quietly) Oh no
Rachel| Ross Im so sorry. Okay. I-I will promise I will straighten this
out with him tomorrow in person, or via e-mail.
Ross| I dont care about your dad! I care about Mona! She was there and now
shes totally freaked out!
Rachel| Oh okay, Ill fix that to. Whats her e-mail address?
Ross| Rachel!
Rachel| All right, I promise. Ill fix this. I swear.
Ill-Ill-Ill-Ill talk to her.
Ross| Okay!
Rachel| Okay.
Ross| Thank you!
Phoebe| Thats it?! You call that a fight? Come on! "We were on a
break!" "No we werent!" What happened to you two?!
[Scene| Ross's Apartment, Ross is opening the door to Mona. Rachel is there as well.]
Ross| Thank you so much for coming back over.
Mona| Oh good, youre here. Yeah, and I was worried that it was going to be
uncomfortable.
Rachel| I know Mona, just hear me out. First of all, Im so sorry about my
father yelling at you, but I heard you totally held your own. Youre gonna have to
tell me how you did that.
Ross| Focus.
Rachel| Okay. UmButOkay, yes Ross and I used to date. And yes we are
gonna have a baby. But we are definitely not getting back together.
Mona| How can I be sure on that?
Rachel| Oh we justwe drove each other crazy!
Ross| Yeah.
Rachel| I mean he was possessive, he was jealous, he could never just let the
little things go!
Ross| Trying to date this woman.
Rachel| Right! But, none of that compared to how kind and-and how gentle and
thoughtful he is. (Rubbing his shoulder.)
Ross| Probably shouldnt touch me.
Mona| Yknow, I-I-I justI dont want to get in the middle of
something so complicated.
Rachel| I know, I get it, but Mona, what relationship is not complicated? I mean
we all have our baggage! You must too! Why else would you still be single? (Mona looks at
her.) I am so gonna leave right now. (Ross opens the door for her and she leaves.)
Ross| Should I leave this open for you too?
Mona| Im not sure yet. Why didnt you just tell me about all this?
Ross| Because whats going on with Rachel has nothing to do with how I feel
about you.
Mona| Yeah? Well you still shoulda told me.
Ross| I know and I was going to, but I thought it was better that you heard it
from Rachels father. Look II made a mistake, but its only because I
really, really like you. Really!
Mona| Okay, I guess you canclose the door now. (He does so and they kiss.)
Rachel| (entering) Forgot my purse! (Sees them kissing.) Oh, you guys made up.
(To Mona) Hes a good kisser isnt he? (Ross goes to close the door on her.)
Im going! (Quickly leaves and Ross locks the door.)
[Scene| Monica and Chandler's, the bachelor party has ended and Monica is trying to
explain herself to Chandler.]
Monica| I swear I didnt know she was a hooker! I mean whDid you let
her smoke in here?
Chandler| Her ass print is still on your grandmothers quilt, do you really
want to talk about smoking?
Monica| Yknow what? Im gonna make this up to you. I promised you a
stripper (turns on the radio), and youre gonna get a stripper. (She starts to
strip.)
Chandler| Monica! Wait!
Monica| What?
Chandler| (puts on his crown) Carry on.
Monica| Ooh, these tennis shoes are so tight. I think Ill take them off.
(Goes to do so.)
Chandler| Could you not narrate?
Monica| Gotcha sailor. (Kicks one of her shoes off and it lands in the kitchen
knocking something down, but she continues to strip.)
[Scene| Joey and Rachel's, Rachel is being yelled at by her dad over the phone, and
hes been going on for so long Rachel is holding the phone away from her ear and
reading a book.]
Dr. Green| (on phone) just because youre not in love with the guy
you cant
Phoebe| (entering, quietly) Wow, you told your dad the truth.
Rachel| About an hour ago.
Phoebe| Wanna go see a movie?
Rachel| Yes! (She gets up and sets the phone on the counter without hanging it
up.) Bye daddy. (Phoebe and her leave.)
Dr. Green| (on phone, not hearing her) theres gonna be a wedding!
(Joey enters from his room and goes to get a beer from the fridge.) Thats
unacceptable Rachel! What the hell does love have to do with it anyway?! There are more
important things in a marriage other than love! (Joey hears something and looks around for
the source.) constantly thinking about things! You have to think about the
consequences of your decision. (Joey finds that the sound is coming from the phone and
puts it to his ear.)
Joey| (on phone) Hey! I do too think about the consequences of my decisions!
(Listens) What gives you the right to (Listens) Go to hell! (Hangs up the phone and
opens the fridge.) Stupid guy on my phone.
[Scene| Joey and Rachel's, Joey is reading What to Expect When Youre Expecting
as Rachel enters from her bedroom.]
Joey| Hey Rach listen, did you know that during pregnancy your fingers swell up
to twice their size and never go back.
Rachel| (looking at her fingers) Oh myGod! Let me see that! (Grabs the
book from him.)
Joey| (laughing) You fall for it every time!
Phoebe| (entering) Hey!
Rachel| Hi!
Phoebe| I brought you my old maternity clothes! (Sets a bag on the counter.)
Rachel| Oh Pheebs thats so sweet(Grabs a pair of pants)Ooh,
those are so cute!
Phoebe| Yeah! And look, (Grabs the pants) see how they expand as the baby grows?
(Theres a stretchy part in front.) And then after the babys born, theyre
great for shoplifting melons.
Monica| (entering) Oh good youre all here. Thanksgiving tomorrow, four
oclock. (To Rachel) Oh, guess who I invited. Remember that guy Will Colbert from
high school?
Rachel| No.
Monica| He was in Rosss classmarching bandkinda overweight?
Well, really overweight. I mean I was his thin friend.
Rachel| Wow! I dont remember him. Honey, are you sure youre not
talking about your imaginary boyfriend.
Monica| No that was Jarred! Wow! I havent thought about him in a long
time (Stares off into the distance lost in thought.) (Pause) Anyway, umm
Wills, Wills here on business and he didnt have a place to go so I
invited him here.
Rachel| Oh thats nice.
Monica| Oh, and by the way, hes lost a bunch of weight. I mean he looks
goo-ood! Okay, I mean really, really gorgeous! (Joey clears his throat.) I still
love Chandler.
Joey| I just want you to say it once in a while.
Monica| All right okay, just so you know, Im not gonna make a turkey this
year.
Joey| What?!
Monica| Well Phoebe doesnt eat turkey
Joey| Phoebe!
Phoebe| Turkeys are beautiful, intelligent animals!
Joey| No theyre not! Theyre ugly and stupid and delicious!
Monica| All right! Okay, its just Phoebe. Wills still on a diet,
Chandler doesnt eat Thanksgiving food, and Rachels having her aversion to
poultry.
Joey| She is?
Rachel| Remember I had to leave the room the other day when you had that roast
chicken?
Joey| Yeah. But I thought that was because I put the whole thing on my hand and
made it walk across the table.
Monica| Anyway, it just doesnt seem worth it to make a whole turkey for
just three people. Okay? Its a lot of work.
Joey| But you gotta have turkey on Thanksgiving! I mean, Thanksgiving with no
turkey is like-like Fourth of July with no apple pie! Or Friday with no two pizzas!
Monica| All right fine! If it means that much to you! But justtheres
gonna be a ton left over.
Joey| No there wont! I promise I will finish that turkey!
Monica| All right, youre telling me you can eat an entire turkey in just
one sitting?
Joey| Thats right! Cause Im a Tribbiani! (To Rachel) And this
is what we do! I mean we may not be great thinkers or world leaders, we dont read a
lot or run very fast, but damnit! We can eat!
[Scene| Monica and Chandler's, Chandler is watching football, and its actually
the right game Green Bay at Detroit (although not this years), as Monica is getting
everything ready.]
Monica| Hey, isnt weird to think about how next year at this time
theyll be a little baby at the table? (Chandler turns around in horror.) (Seeing
him) Rachels! But good to know where youre at!
Phoebe| (entering) Hey!
Monica| Hey!
Phoebe| Happy Thanksgiving!
Monica| You too!
Phoebe| Anything I can do to help?
Monica| Actually there is. Chandler usually helps me with this, but hes
really into the game so I dont want to bother him. Could you help me fold these
napkins? (Hands her a stack of them.)
Phoebe| Sure!
Monica| Im gonna go across the hall to check on the yams.
Phoebe| Okay. (She starts folding the napkins in half.)
Monica| No! No! No! No sweetie! No! Not like that! Were not at a barn
dance. Youve gottayou wanna fold them like swans. Like I showed you at
Christmas time, remember?
Phoebe| Yeah, it all just came screaming back to me. (Monica exits.) (To
Chandler) So hows the game?
Chandler| I have no idea.
Phoebe| What?
Chandler| Yeah! Im just pretending to watch the game so I dont have
to help out with stuff.
Phoebe| I dont believe you! That isbrilliant! And Monica has no
idea?
Chandler| Nope! Every once and a while I just scream stuff at the TV.
Monica| Is your team winning hon?
Chandler| Yeah! Anderson just scored again! (To Phoebe) Theres no
Anderson.
Phoebe| Well I want to get in on this. Hey Mon? I dont think I can help
you after all, I didnt realize this game was on.
Monica| Oh, I didnt know you liked football.
Phoebe| Well normally I dont, but yknow(looks at the
TV)Green Bay is playing.
Monica| You like Green Bay?
Phoebe| Well its only like my favorite bay! {Actually, its not bad.
It just gets a little cold in winter, but in Wisconsin winter only lasts from August to
June. J }
Monica| Hey!
Will| Hey!
Will| Happy Thanksgiving!
Monica| Aww thanks! God Will Im so glad that you came! You look great! You
mustve lost like
Will| 150 pounds. Yeah, Im gonna be in one of those Subway sandwich
commercials.
Monica| A pie! (Will brought a pie.)
Will| Oh right. All right, its no fat, its no sugar, its no
dairyits no good. Throw it out.
Monica| You wanna meet some people? This is uh; this is my husband Chandler.
Chandler, this is Will.
Will| Hey.
Chandler| Oh hey. Id shake your hand but uh; Im really into the
game. Plus, I think itd be better for my ego if we didnt stand right next to
each other.
Monica| This is Phoebe.
Phoebe| (nonchalantly glancing) Hey. (Turns back around.) Wow! (Looks up.) Well
done.
Monica| (to Will) Wanna give me a hand?
Will| Sure! Monica, I cant get over how great you look! You look stunning!
Monica| Well you look incredible too! Youre justyoure so fit!
Chandler| Im watching the game, but Im not deaf!
Monica| Oh umm, I meant to tell you, Ross is coming.
Will| Ross is coming. Great! I love Ross!
Monica| Good. And Rachel Green too. (Will stops suddenly.)
Will| Oh.
Monica| Is there a problem?
Will| Nope. Uh, its okay. Its just uh, God I hated her.
Monica| What?
Will| Yeah, I hated her. She was horrible to me in high school. But hey, it was
a long time ago, Im in a good place, it might be actually fun to see her again. You
got any cakes or cookies or something? (Starts looking.) No Will no!
Chandler| (To Phoebe) Yknow, its been a while since weve
screamed something. Maybe we should.
Phoebe| Oh okay.
Chandler| Oh come on!
Phoebe| Noooo!! Damn you ref! You burn in hell!!!
Monica| Hey, what are you doing? You gotta save room, youve got almost an
entire turkey to eat.
Joey| Let me explain to you how the human body works. I have to warm my stomach
first. Eatin chips is like stretching.
Monica| All right.
Joey| Dont worry, Tribbianis never get full.
Will| I actually know what youre talking about. Im here to tell you
something my friend, you can eat and eat and eat but nothing will ever fill that void.
Joey| (To Monica) Who the hell is this guy?
Monica| Will! From high school.
Joey| Oh hey!
Monica| (to Will) Joey.
Will| Hello.
Ross| (entering) Will!
Will| Ross!
Ross| Hey-hey you came! Man you look incredible! Hot stuff! (They hug and Ross
realizes what he said.) Hot stuff?
Will| Its good to see you man.
Ross| Yeah, you too. Man, so-so what are you up to?
Will| Im a commodities broker.
Ross| Really? Yeah that-that sounds interesting.
Will| Yeah, its not. But Im rich and thin.
Ross| Oh! Man I dont think Ive seen you since uh, Lance Davis
graduation party.
Will| That was such a fun night!
Ross| Yeah. It wouldve been good if we had gotten in, but still real fun.
Will| Yeah.
Ross| Yeah.
Will| God we were lame back then. Do you remember how into dinosaurs we were?
Ross| (laughs) Yeah.
Will| So what do you, what do you do now?
Ross| So how long are you in town?
Rachel| (entering, carrying a baking dish) Hi!
Monica| Hey sweetie. Oh good. (Takes the baking dish from her.)
Will| (glaring at Rachel) Rachel Green.
Ross| Awoh, thats right. Are-are you gonna be okay?
Will| Oh, Ill-Ill be fine. Just God I hate her Ross! I hate her!
Ross| Will, high school was-was a long time ago.
Rachel| (sees Will) Oh my God Monica, who is that?
Monica| Thats Will from high school!
Rachel| Oh! I do not remember him! Wow! He's really got that sexy, smoldering
thing going on. (We see Will angrily staring at Rachel.) Oh my God, hes Look
at the way hes just staring at me. I think hes trying to mouth something to
me, but I cant make it out. (Will mouths, "I hate you.")
Monica| Okay, dinners ready!
Chandler| Good game!
Phoebe| Yeah.
Chandler| Yeah. Solid effort. Solid effort.
Monica| Oh, so who won?
Phoebe| (simultaneously) Green Bay.
Chandler| (simultaneously) Detroit.
Monica| What?
Phoebe| Well the Lions technically won, but it was a moral victory for the Green
BayMermen.
Rachel| Hi! Will, right?
Will| Right.
Rachel| Hi! Im Rachel Green.
Will| Oh I-I remember you.
Rachel| Really?! Arent you sweet! I gotta tell you though, I am, I am
having the hardest time placing you. Oh-oh hang on! Did we umm, did we fool around at
Lance Davis graduation party?
Will| You are unbelievable.
Rachel| Thank you!
Monica| (breaking it up) Uh Rachel? Rachel, why dont you sit here? (Next
to Joey) And Will you sit way over there. (The other side of the table.)
Joey| Thats it?! Even if nobody helps me I can eat that no problem. At
least give me a challenge!
Monica| (laughs) This is Chandlers chicken. This is the turkey. (Sets down
a huge turkey.)
Joey| (quietly) Oh. How-how big is that?
Monica| About nineteen pounds.
Joey| (To Rachel) Its like me when I was born.
Rachel| All right, who would uh, like some yams? Will?
Will| Oh, youd like that wouldnt ya?
Rachel| What? (Joey starts offering Ross some turkey.) Oh yknow what? Can
we please keep the chicken and the turkey and everything on the other side of the table?
The smell is just yuck!
Will| (sneeze talks) Typical.
Rachel| Im sorry. What?
Will| I said it was typical. Typical of you, Rachel Green, Queen Rachel does
whatever she wants in little Rachel land. (Does a fake hair flip.)
Joey| (To Monica) Seriously, who is this guy?
Rachel| Umm, Im sorry. Do you-do you have a problem with me?
Will| I dont know? Do I? Do I?
Phoebe| I think you do.
Monica| (To Rachel) Apparently you were umm, a little mean to him in high
school.
Will| A little mean? You made my life miserable!
Rachel| Im-ImI had no idea. Im sorry. I
Will| Well you should be. Screw it! Bring on the yams!
Monica| Oh Will. But you-youve worked so hard
Will| Yams!!!!
Monica| Okay. (Chandler grabs the dish from Monica and hands it to Will who
starts dishing out a large helping.)
Rachel| Uh Will umm, I just want to say that Im real sorry for whatever
I-I did to you in high school
Will| Oh, it wasnt just me. We had a club!
Rachel| You had a club?!
Will| Thats right, The I Hate Rachel Green Club!
Rachel| Whoa! My God! So what, you all just joined together to hate me?! Who
else was in this club?
Will| Me and Ross. (Points at Ross.)
Ross| No need to point, she knows who Ross is.
[Scene| Monica and Chandler's, scene continued from earlier.]
Rachel| (To Ross) So you were in an I Hate Rachel club?
Will| Yes he was. (Holds up his hand for a high-five.)
Ross| No. No.
Rachel| So who else was in this club?
Ross| Uh actually, there-there was also that exchange student from Thailand but
I-I dont think he-he knew what it was.
Rachel| So Ross, we went out for two years, and you never told me you were in an
I Hate Rachel club.
Will| You went out with her?! We had a pact!
Ross| That was in high school! Its not like it was binding forever.
Will| Then why did it have the word eternity in it?
Rachel| Okay Monica, did you know about this?!
Monica| I swear I didnt. (To Ross and Will) Hey! Is that why you guys used
to go up to your bedroom and lock the door?
Ross and Will|
Monica| Hmm, a little relieved, I gotta say.
Ross| Look Rach I-Im sorry, okay? II was a stupid kid, okay? The
only reason I joined
Will| Co-founded!
Ross| co-founded. Co-founded the club was because I was insanely in love
with you. Obviously I didnt handle it very well. But if you think about it the I
Hate Rachel Club was really the I Love Rachel Club.
Will| Uh, except that it was really the I Hate Rachel Club.
Rachel| Okay. So what? You guys would just like get together and like just say
mean things about me?
Will| Well, we did a little more than that.
Ross| No-no! No-no. No-no.
Phoebe| What?! What else did you do?
Will| We started a rumor.
Rachel| What rumor?
Phoebe| Oh, come on Will! Just take off your shirt and tell us!
Rachel| Ross!
Ross| It was no big deal. We-wesaid that the rumor wasthat
ummyou had bothmale and female reproductive parts.
Rachel| What?!
Will| Thats right! We said your parents flipped a coin, decided to raise
you as a girl, but you still had a hint of a penis.
Rachel| (shocked) Oh my God!
Monica| You started that?!
Rachel| What?! You heard that?! (Goes and stands behind Joey.)
Monica| Everyone at our school heard it!
Chandler| Everybody at my school heard it! You were the hermaphrodite
cheerleader from Long Island?!
Rachel| Oh no!!!! Oh my God!! This is all making so much sense to me now! This
is why Adam Carter wouldnt go out with me! This is why Billy Tratt would just stay
in this region! (Motions to her breasts.) (Joey has turned around.)
Ross| Actually, Billy Tratt is gay now. So-so that ones not really our
fault.
Rachel| Monica, how come you never told me this?!
Monica| I thought it might be true. And I was afraid that you were gonna cry and
then show it to me.
Rachel| Joey stop staring! Theres nothing there! Its not true!
Joey| Im afraid Im gonna need proof.
Rachel| Oh! (Hits him and storms out.)
Joey| You are my Everest.
Monica| Joey, you dont have to finish that.
Joey| Oh yes I do. Otherwise whats next? Today Im just a guy who
cant finish a turkey, but tomorrow Im the guy who eats half a Powerbar,
wraps up the rest, and puts in the fridge? No! No, I justI justI gotta change
my pants. (Gets up and heads for the door.) Jeans have no give. (Exits.)
Rachel| (entering carrying a book) Okay! Okay! Listen to what Sean McMahon wrote
in my yearbook senior year, "Dear Rach, youre such a good person." Not
girl! Person!
Ross| Rach, I think youre reading a little too much into it.
Rachel| (reading what he wrote again) "Dear Rach, youre a great
person. Sorry about your tiney-wienie." (Will laughs.)
Ross| Look, what do you want me to do? Do you want me to call everyone in the
entire school and tell them it wasnt true?!
Rachel| Yes!
Will| Could you also tell them Im skinny now?
Monica| Oh! Me too!
Ross| Well look-look Im not calling anybody! Okay? It was like a million
years ago!
Rachel| I dont care how long ago it was! You told people that I was half
and half! Yknow what? I just want to point out I never did anything to hurt you in
high school.
Monica| Thats not totally true.
Rachel| What?
Ross| What?
Monica| Well you-you did start that rumor about Ross making out with Mrs.
Altman, our 50-year-old librarian.
Ross| (shocked) (To Rachel) How did you know that?!!!!
Monica| Its true?!!
Ross| No.
Rachel| Yes it is! I saw you guys going at it behind the card catalog!
Will| Mrs. Altman? She also made out with Takaka Ci-Kek the night before he went
back to Thailand.
Chandler| Im sorry. When you were in high school you made out with a
50-year-old woman?
Ross| Hey! She didnt look 50!
Chandler| Did she look 16?
Rachel| Ohh, theres a picture of her in the yearbook actually.
Phoebe| Oh! (They all look.) Wow!
Ross| She didnt photograph well!
Chandler| Well, she probably wasnt familiar with the process having spent
most of her life sitting for oil paintings!
Phoebe| So how did this happen? Did she, did she lure you to an early bird
dinner?
Ross| I was working late in the library one afternoon. It was just the two of
us. She needed some help with her word jumble. And one thing led to another. If you must
know, Anita was very gentle and tender. May she rest in peace
Monica| Didnt she walk with a cane?
Ross| Only when it was damp!! (To Rachel) I cant believe you-you told
people about this?! Everybody knew?! Yknow what? (To Will) Im back in the
club!
Will| Yeah! (They high-five.)
Phoebe| I wanna join!
Rachel| WhPhoebe!!
Phoebe| Im sorry. Im sorry. I never got to be in a club. I-I
didnt go to high school, but three of us would meet behind a dumpster to learn
French. Bonjour.
Rachel| All right, yknowFine! You guys have your stupid little club,
but I would just like to say is what you did to me is way worse than what I did to you!
You gave me a tiney-wienie! (Will laughs.)
Monica| All right, listen youre just being silly. Rachel, even with that
rumor you were one of the most popular girls in school and everyone wanted to be like you.
One girl wanted to be like you so much she stuffed her pants with a Tootsie Roll!
Rachel| Wow
Monica| And Ross, if it werent for Rachels rumor I mean no one in
high school would even know who you were. She put you on the map!
Ross| As a romancer of the elderly.
Monica| Hey! Mrs. Altman was the kind of woman you could tell she used to be
pretty.
Ross| The eyesdid still sparkle.
Monica| Hey guys this stuff is just so way in the past. You-youve been
through so much since then. And right now youve got so much more important stuff
going on in your life. Cant you just let this go?
Rachel| Shes right.
Ross| Yeah. I mean we are having a baby together.
Will| Hold on! You got her pregnant?
Ross| Yeah.
Will| Are ya getting married?
Ross| Nope.
Will| So you knocked her up but youre not gonna marry her. Dude! (Wants
another high-five and Ross ignores him.) Anybody?
Phoebe| Okay. (Goes over and hugs him.) Its exactly how Id imagined
it would be.
Joey| (entering, wearing the maternity pants from earlier) All right
wheres that turkey!
Phoebe| Joey! Those are my maternity pants!
Joey| Not now! These are my Thanksgiving pants!
[Scene| Monica and Chandler's, Will has left and the rest of the gang is watching Joey
finish the turkey.]
Joey| Well thats it. Im done. Whew! (Wipes his forehead.) There come
the meat sweats. (Chandler hands him a towel and he wipes his face.)
Monica| Well Joey, were allwere all very proud of you.
Chandler| Yes, I believe we can expect a call from the President any moment now.
Phoebe| Is there anything we can do for you?
Joey| No just, nobody press on my stomach.
Rachel| You can keep those pants by the way.
Joey| Whoaheywh-wh-what do you got there? What is that? Pie?
Monica| Yeah, you want some?
Joey| Ah, just cut me a little sliver. (Monica prepares to cut a little sliver.)
A little bigger. (Monica prepares to cut a bigger piece.) Little bigger. (Monica moves the
knife again.) What?! Are you afraid youre gonna run out?! Cut me a real piece!

[Scene| Monica and Chandler's, Monica is trying on a pair of new boots as Chandler
enters.]
Monica| Hey! So what do you think?
Chandler| New haircut? (Monica nods No.) Necklace? (No) Dress? (No)
Boots? (Monica nods Yes.) Boots!
Monica| Yes! Now, theyre a little more than I normally spend on
bootsor rent (Shows him the receipt.)
Chandler| Oh my God!
Monica| I know.
Chandler| Im gonna miss being able to afford food.
Monica| Im sorry, they just, they just look so good! And the saleswoman
was looking at me like, "Oh, these are way too expensive for you."
Chandler| She had a point. (Shows her the receipt.)
Rachel| (entering) Hi!
Monica| Hey.
Rachel| Oh my God! (Notices the boots) Oh Monica! Those boots are amazing!
Monica| Theyre mine!
Chandler| Yeah well, too bad were gonna have to return them.
Rachel| Return them?! Shh! Theyre gonna hear you!
Monica| Honey, Im not returning them. Okay? I mean I-I know they cost a
lot, but Im going to wear them all the time. Youll see. Besides, I love the
compliments. I mean, have you ever had something so beautiful everyone wanted it?
Chandler| I have you.
Monica| Nice try; Im keeping the boots.
[Scene| Central Perk, Phoebe, Ross, and Rachel are sitting on the couch and Ross is
talking to Rachels, who is now showing, stomach.]
Ross| Thats right, I love you! And-and Im gonna play with you all
the time.
Phoebe| How can you let him talk to your crotch like that?
Rachel| (pause) Hes talking to the baby.
Phoebe| Ohh! Okay! Okay, cause when-when he said, "I cant wait to
hear your first words," I thought, "Theres a trick."
Rachel| Okay. Well, I gotta go you guys. Ill see you later.
Phoebe| Okay.
Ross| Bye.
Rachel| Bye. (She gets up to leave but is stopped by Joey)
Joey| Oh hey Rach, listenHi!
Rachel| Hi.
Joey| Umm, can you do me a favor? I was talkin to my sister and she knows
you work at Ralph Lauren
Rachel| No, forget it! No way! I am not sending anymore Ralph Lauren
clothes to prison. It is a waste.
Joey| No-no-no-no-no-no, not her, not her. My youngest sister, Dina, shes
really interested in fashion, and she wants to talk to someone successful, yknow, to
give her some advice.
Rachel| I guess I can talk to one of my supervisors
Joey| Oh no-no-no-no, she wants to talk to you!
Rachel| Really?! Oh my God! Im successful!
Joey| Okay, so will you meet with her?
Rachel| Yes! Id love to! Have her come by the office.
Joey| Great! Thanks! Youre gonna love her so much. AndOh, shes
the smartest of all the Tribbiani children. Hey, yknow the S.A.Ts?
Rachel| Yeah.
Joey| She took em!
Phoebe| Hey Ross! Doesnt Ben go to the Smithfield Day School?
Ross| Yeah. Why?
Phoebe| Sting has a son that goes there too!
Ross| Yeah I know; hes in Bens class.
Phoebe| You knew this and you never said anything?! With all the stupid dinosaur
stuff you tell us?!
Ross| Fine! No more dinosaur stuff! Can I talk about fossils? (Joey is about to
sit down and hears this so instead he groans and exits.)
Phoebe| Stings son, seven years old and theres a picture.
Ross| What are you reading? The Kidnappers Guide to Manhattan Private Schools?
Phoebe| No, its New York magazine. Its an article about the
best schools in the city. So how well do you know Sting?
Ross| Uh, I actually havent even met him.
Phoebe| Uh-huh, yeah thats too bad. I really want to go to his concert
Friday night, but its totally sold out. I know! Why dont you meet him and get
tickets?! If you get two Ill take you.
Ross| Well actually, Im picking Ben up tomorrow, maybe hell be
there.
Phoebe| There you go! Oh, you are so lucky! You might actually get to meet Sting
tomorrow! Thats why you have kids!
[Scene| Central Perk, the next day Rachel, Phoebe, and Chandler are there as Monica
enters.]
Monica| Hey guys!
Chandler| Hey-hey.
Rachel| Hi Monica!
Monica| Hey. (Sits down on the arm of the couch.)
Rachel| Hi boots.
Monica| See Chandler? Im getting a lot of use out of them already!
Theyre very practical. See, you can wear them with dresses, with skirts, with
pants
Chandler| You can wear them with shorts on a street corner and earn the money to
pay for them. (Goes and gets some coffee at the counter.)
Phoebe| Wow! Theyre beautiful!
Rachel| Ahh
Monica| (almost crying) They hurt so much!
Phoebe| What?!
Monica| The guy who made these hates feet and wants to see them die!
Rachel| Well-well you can give them to me! I havent felt my feet in years!
Monica| I cant! I spent so much money on them and I told Chandler that
Id wear them all the time, I just cant give them away!
Phoebe| Well then get your money back and return them!
Monica| I cant do that either! The soles are already a little
scuffed up and the insides are filled with my blood.
Ross| (entering) Hey!
Chandler| (returning to his seat) Hey!
Ross| Hey I uh just picked up Ben from school
Chandler| (spinning around looking for him) I dont think you did a very
thorough job!
Ross| I dropped him off at Carols. (To Phoebe) Anyway, it turns out that
Im not going to be able to get those tickets though.
Phoebe| Oh no! Why not?
Ross| Well it turns out that Ben and Stings son do not get along.
Phoebe| How come?!
Ross| Apparently, Stings son made fun of the fact that Bens moms are
lesbinims.
Phoebe| Wait! But Ross if they dont get along then you should
smooth things over. Make them be friends.
Ross| Phoebe, you cant force kids to be friends.
Phoebe| Sure you can! Give them some blocks, put them in a playpen!
Ross| Playpen?! Bens seven!
Phoebe| Your kid is seven?! (Ross nods, "Yes.") (To the rest)
Hes really small. (To Ross) Please! Please get the tickets!
Ross| Look Im sorry Pheebs, I cant do it.
Phoebe| Yes you can! Sting says so himself!
Ross| What?
Phoebe| (singing) Rosssss can!
Ross| Look Phoebe, Im sorry its just
Phoebe| (singing) Rossss can!
Ross| Phoebe, I
Phoebe| (singing) Rosss can! Give me the tickets! Ross can give me the
tickets!!
[Scene| Rachels Office, Joey has brought Dina to meet with Rachel.]
Joey| (entering, with Dina) Here she is! Future fashion superstar!
Rachel| Oh Joey, Im hardly a
Joey| My little sister Dina!
Rachel| Right! Hi Dina!
Dina| Hi.
Rachel| Nice to meet you. (They shake hands.)
Dina| Thanks so much for meetin with me. Joeys told me so much about
you!
Joey| This is so exciting for her. Well, Ill let you two fashists
get down to business. (Exits.)
Rachel| Okay. All right Dina, well lets talk about the different areas of
fashion that you could get involved in. Lets see, theres design, but you may
need a whole other degree for that. Uh, theres-theres sales, which is great
because you get to travel
Dina| II dont care about fashion! Im pregnant! And I know you
are too, so you gotta help me!
Rachel| (stunned) And theres marketing
[Scene| The Hallway, Monica is returning, but before she enters the apartment she stops
on the step and changes from wearing tennis shoes to the boots and she moans in pain as
she puts each boot on.]
Monica| (standing up) Ahhhhhhhh!
Chandler| (opening the door) Whats wrong?
Monica| Oh nothing Im justjust was yawning. (Mimics the groan from
before and stretches.)
Chandler| Oh dont forget, my office holiday party is tonight. (They go
into the apartment.)
Monica| Honey, we dont really have to go to this thing tonight do we?
Chandler| Now sweetie, I know you dont like my office parties, but you can
wear your new boots. See? Every cloud has asupple leather lining.
Monica| I-I dont-I dont think that Im gonna wear the boots
tonight.
Chandler| Why not?
Monica| Well yknow, Im just-Im just worried that bosses will
see them and think they pay you too much money. Or! Or your assistant will see them
and-and want a raise!
Chandler| Do you think I work at some kind of boot pricing company?
Monica| Anyway, I picked up this outfit that I want to wear and the, and the
boots dont really go with it.
Chandler| You said that you paid all that money because those boots go with
skirts, dresses, and pants!
Monica| Fine! If you want me to wear the boots, Ill wear the boots. In
fact, Ill go into my room right now and yknow try the outfit on.
Chandler| Okay.
Monica| Okay? (She starts to walk which causes her to start crying) Ooo wee!
Christmas party in my boots! (Runs into the bedroom and mixes saying ow with
laughing.)
[Scene| The Hallway, Rachel is about to enter her apartment with Dina to tell Joey the
news.]
Dina| I-I cant go in there. I cant tell him!
Rachel| Honey, its going to be okay. Hes been incredibly supportive
of me, and if he gets a little upset; thats what the meatball sub is for. (She gives
Dina a sandwich wrapped in aluminum foil.)
Dina| Thank you.
Rachel| Okay.
Joey| Hey! Its my fashion girls! (They dont react.) Whats
wrong?
Rachel| Honey, why dont you sit down? Dina has something that she wants to
tell you.
Joey| (concerned) Oh. Whats, whats going on? Is it mom? Is she sick?
Is it dads heart? Is that a sandwich?
Dina| Joe, mom and dad are fine
Joey| Is that a sandwich?!
Rachel| Joeytheres something that youshould know. Dina?
Dina| Im pregnant.
Joey| (angrily) What?!
Rachel| (To Dina) Now! Give him the sandwich! Give him the sandwich! (She
quickly sets the sandwich in front of him.)
Joey| Well obviously this is a mistake! You cant be pregnant! Because you
have to have sex to get pregnant!
Dina| Joe, I tried to wait until I was 25 like you did!
Rachel| What?! Dina
Joey| (to Rachel) Bub!!! (Points at her and quiets Rachel.) (To Dina) I
cant believe this! Youre the good one! You went to college! Both years! Who
did this to you?!
Dina| Bobby Corso, but hes a real nice guy. I like him a lot. Hes
real funny.
Joey| You got pregnant for funny?! Dinaif hes funnylaugh!
All right, Ill be back in a little while! You stay here!
Dina| Why? Where are you going?
Joey| I cant look at you right now! (Exits and slams the door behind him.)
Dina| Wow.
Rachel| I know.
[Scene| The Midfield Day School, its after school and Ben is taking a drink of
water as Phoebe enters.]
Phoebe| Oh, there you are Ben!
Ben| Aunt Phoebe, what are you doing here?
Phoebe| Well, I heard youre having a problem with one of the boys in your
class. And so I thought I would just come down here and sit you both down, have a little
talk and make it all okay. Now umm, the boys name is Stings son.
Ben| Jack? I hate him! Hes a jerk.
Phoebe| Now Ben, sometimes people may seem like jerks on the outside, but they
have famous fathers.
Ben| I have to go. My friend Doug is waiting for me over there. (Goes over to
Doug.)
Phoebe| Him youre friends with. (Starts looking at the children trying to
find Jack and a teacher notices her.)
The Teacher| Excuse me. Can, can I help you with something?
Phoebe| Yes! Yes you can, Im looking for Jacks parents.
The Teacher| Are you with one of the students?
Phoebe| Uh-huh, Im with Ben.
The Teacher| Are you one of Bens mothers?
Phoebe| I am one of Bens mothers. Im a lesbian. It was, it was
difficult coming out to my parents.
The Teacher| Well hi, Im Jenny Boone. Im the new teacher here.
Phoebe| Oh.
The Teacher| Ive only met your partner Carol.
Phoebe| Ah! Okay so that would make me Susan.
The Teacher| Right. Are you looking for Jacks parents to discuss the
problems hes having with Ben? (Phoebe nods Yes.) Yeah. Because I really
do think the parents should sit down and have a conversation.
Phoebe| Yeah! Lets do that!! That-that sounds good. We should sit down and
talk, just me, my lover Carol, and the Stings. Umm, how-how will I get in touch with them?
The Teacher| Oh, their number is on the contact sheet.
Phoebe| Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Umm, could-could I get a copy of that? Cause Carol
threw it out, she lost ours. Shes such a scatterbrain, but man what a hot piece of
ass.
[Scene| A Street, Chandler and Monica are walking down the sidewalk after his office
holiday party.]
Chandler| Yknow, that party wasnt bad.
Monica| Yeah! I didnt know there would be dancing. That was a fun
surprise!
Chandler| I dont see any uh, cabs. Maybe we should just walk?
Monica| Oh no, we cant walk!
Chandler| What honey, its like fifteen blocks to the subway. Lets
go.
Monica| Hey! Do you think that we can get to the subway right there if we climb
down through the manhole cover?
Chandler| Whats going on?
Monica| I cant walk. Okay? Okay? These boots were a huge mistake!
Chandler| What?
Monica| Okay you were right! All right, I never should have bought them!
Theyre killing me! One toe at a time!
Chandler| So I was right. This is what it feels like to be right. (Pause)
Its oddly unsettling.
Monica| How are we gonna get home? Maybe a piggy-back ride?
Chandler| Hop on.
Monica| Okay. Wait, just give me a second, I need to just get my boots off
first. (She starts taking them off.) AhOohOohhOhhOh
GodOhhOhOhhOhhhh
Chandler| Honey, I know youre in pain right now, but Im a little
turned on.
[Scene| Joey and Rachel's, Dina and Rachel are reading pregnancy books, Dina Pregnancy
for Dummies and Rachel something else.]
Dina| Do you ever worry that youll be walking and your baby will just like
slip out?
Rachel| What college was that Dina?
Dina| Oh my God! Bobby!
Bobby| Hi Dina. Good to see you.
Rachel| Joey, what are you doing?
Joey| Just what needs to be done! Dearly beloved, we are gathered here to join
this man and this woman
Rachel| Oh Joey this is crazy!
Joey| Dont interrupt me when Im talkin to God! Now where were
we? Oh right, okay. Do you Dina, take this man
Dina| No!
Joey| Oh youll take em!
Dina| No I wont!
Joey| Hey! You dont get a say in this!
Dina| Yes I do!
Joey| Ahhh! I heard "I do", were halfway there! Okay! (To Bobby)
You!
Rachel| All right Joey! That is enough! (Grabs him and pulls him away from Bobby
and Dina) Listen, as beautiful and moving as this ceremony is, its not legal. Okay?
They-they dont have a marriage license, they dont have any witnesses, and the
groom only has on one shoe!
Bobby| Yeah, he took the other one off and hit me with it.
Joey| Well what am I supposed to do?
Rachel| Youre supposed to realize that they are adults! And that they can
make their own decisions.
Joey| No they cant! They were stupid enough to get knocked up!
Rachel| Heyyyyy! Contraceptives are not always effective! (To Bobby and Dina)
Right?
Bobby| Yeahwe kinda didnt use any
Rachel| Oh, come on kids! A little help here!
[Scene| Stings Apartment, Phoebe has come to talk about Jack and is waiting for
Stings wife, Trudie Styler, to enter.]
Phoebe| Wow! This place is incredible! (Gasps) Stings penthat he
gave to Phoebe. (Puts the pen in her purse and goes over to a floor-to-ceiling bookcase)
Come on! Secret passageway! (Starts pulling books at random as Trudie enters.)
Trudie Styler| Hi! (By the way, its actually her.)
Phoebe| Hi!
Trudie Styler| Im Trudie.
Phoebe| Uh-huh.
Trudie Styler| You must be Bens mum.
Phoebe| Why else would I be here?
Trudie Styler| Do sit down.
Phoebe| Uh-huh. (They go and sit down.)
Trudie Styler| I gather Jack and Ben havent been getting along lately.
Phoebe| Yeah.
Trudie Styler| Im told there are two sides to this story, but all
Ive heard is that Bens a bit of a poo-poo head.
Phoebe| Umm, Im sorry. Wont-wont Jacks father be joining
us?
Trudie Styler| Oh Im sorry, Jacks father is not available.
Phoebe| Uh-hmm. Okay. Well then, could we reschedule? For say, Friday night
perhaps at 8 oclock?
Trudie Styler| Oh no, I know that wouldnt work. My husbands in
concert.
Phoebe| Concert. Yeah. That does put us inquite a pickle. Because you see
Im very busy before and after the concert, and hes obviously busy during.
Trudie Styler| So, I guess you and I should talk about Jack and Ben right now.
Phoebe| Unless! Unless umm, okay I-I would be willing to go to the concert, umm,
all the while thinking about the children of course.
Trudie Styler| Are you here for tickets?
Phoebe| Oh, thank you. Four would be great.
Trudie Styler| Im not giving concert tickets to someone whod use
their son like this!
Phoebe| Oh good! Then youre in luck! Bens not my son!
Trudie Styler| (stands up) Look, Ive just pressed a button, triggering a
silent alarm. Any minute now, the police will be here!
Phoebe| The Police? Here? A reunion?! (She gets out her camera.)
[Scene| The Street, Chandler is carrying Monica past a store window.]
Chandler| Okay, ten blocks down. Five to go.
Monica| (notices something in the window) Oh wait! Stop! Stop! Stop!
Chandler| Oh Im sorry! Do you need a break?
Monica| My boots in tan! Hey! Can you get a little closer so I can see the
price?
Chandler| I can see it from right here. Itll cost you one husband.
Monica| Okay, Im sorry. I think I can walk the rest of the way now.
Just-just give me my boots.
Chandler| (pause) I dont have your boots.
Monica| Well I dont have them either. Where are they?
Chandler| Well, why dont you check in one of my saddlebags while I chew on
a bale of hay!
Monica| Okay. (She gets off him.) God well, we gotta go back and get them!
Chandler| Honey, are you seriously ever gonna wear the boots again?
Monica| Okay, Im never gonna wear them again. I just didnt get a
chance to say goodbye.
Chandler| Yknow what? You can say goodbye to the tan ones.
Monica| Okay. (Climbs back on his back.) All right.
Chandler| Okay. (Moves closer to the window.)
Monica| (to the boots) Bye bootsWait! Half off?! (Chandler runs off.)
[Scene| Joey and Rachel's, Joey and Rachel are still discussing Bobby and Dinas
situation.]
Rachel| Joey, just because theyre not getting married doesnt mean
this is going to be a disaster. Maybe they have a plan!
Joey| Oh? Oh! Okay! Okay! Lets hear their plan! Now, whats the
future look like for Dina and Bobby?
Bobby| WellI really have high hopes for my band.
Joey| (to Dina) You were right. He is funny.
Rachel| Hey, now wait a minute! I get when you told people at first that you
wanted to be an actor they laughed at you! Now come on Bobby, why dont you tell us a
little bit about your band?
Bobby| Well its just me and my pal Rooster, the bands name is Numb
Nuts.
Rachel| (To Dina) Really? (Nods her head at Bobby.)
Joey| Dina, if youre having a baby you should be married! Even if it is to
Bobby! (Bobby gets happy.) Dude, thats not a compliment!
Dina| No Joey! I knew you wouldnt be supportive!
Joey| So whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa! What are you gonna do? Youre gonna have the
baby and-and raise it by yourselfwithout a husband?! You cant be a single
mother alone! Youre gonna ruin your life!
Rachel| Oh excuse me! Am I ruining my life?
Joey| No! No! No! Its different for you. Youre so strong and
together. Youre not some dumb kid who doesnt know what shes doing.
Dina| Excuse me?
Joey| One pregnant woman at a time, please! I just want you to be okay.
Rachel| So forcing her to marry Bobby is gonna make that happen?
Joey| Maybe! (To Bobby) Well! Wellso-so uh, what kind of music does Numb
NutsOh forget it! I cant!
Dina| Joey, I am scared to death about this. But I really think I can do it,
Im just gonna need some help. And Bobbys gonna be here the whole time.
Bobby| You bet I am! (To Joey) And to answer your earlier question, were
straight-up gangster rap. (Joey shakes his head as if hes about to lose it.)
Dina| Look, Rachels told me how much easier youve made all this on
her. Why cant you do that for me?
Joey| Because! Cause Cause youre my baby sister!
Dina| And youre my big brother! I mean, youre my favorite guy in the
whole world. Im not even scared to tell mom and dad. I was scared of telling you.
Joey| Well Id be scared of them, but all right.
Dina| Joey, I cant stand the thought of having this baby with you mad at
me. I want him to have his uncle. Is my baby gonna have his Uncle Joey?
Joey| Of course hes gonna have his Uncle Joey!
Dina| Were gonna be all right. I mean, even if were not married this
baby is gonna be so loved. Not just by us.
Joey| Thats right! By his uncle too!
Bobby| And by you.
Rachel| Okay Bobby, why dont we just come over here and let them have a
little moment. (Drags Bobby away from Joey and Dina.)
Joey| Come here! (Hugs Dina and Bobby looks to hug Rachel.)
Rachel| No! Seriously! Whats wrong with you?!
[Scene| Central Perk, Phoebe and Ross are there.]
Ross| Youre gonna love me so much. I got Sting tickets!! (Holds up two.)
Phoebe| Oh my God! I do love you! How did you do it?!
Ross| Welllets just say (singing) Rosss caaaaan!
Phoebe| Oo, where are the seats?
Ross| Uh, middle balcony.
Phoebe| Okay, now would you say that thats more than 50 yards away from
Sting, his wife, or a member of his family?
Ross| Yeah.
Phoebe| Then thats not breaking the law! Im there!
[Scene| Central Perk, Rachel is looking around the shop as Phoebe returns from getting
some more coffee.]
Rachel| Phoebe?
Phoebe| Yeah?
Rachel| Look at that guy by the window, wow!
Phoebe| Hes awfully short and I think hes talking to himself. And to
be completely honest, hes not that good in bed.
Rachel| Oh, what is wrong with me lately? I mean its like every guy I
seeI mean look here. (Points behind them) Look at that guy for example, I mean
normally thats not someone I would-would be attracted to, but right now, with the
way Im feeling, all I want to do is rip off his sweatpants and fanny pack.
Phoebe| Wait a second! This is about the fourth month of your pregnancy, right?
Rachel| Yeah.
Phoebe| This is completely normal, around the fourth month your hormones start
going crazy.
Rachel| Really?! So this has happened to you?
Phoebe| Oh absolutely yeah! Oh and keep in mind, now, I was carrying triplets so
in, yknow, medical terms I was-I was thrice as randy.
Rachel| Wow! This explains so much! Last weekend, I went from store to store
sitting on Santas lap.
Phoebe| Yeah. Yeah, I remember trying to steal a cardboard cutout of Evander
Holyfield from a Foot Locker.
Rachel| Ah.
Phoebe| Yeah.
Rachel| Well, yknow what? I go see my doctor tomorrow, Ill ask her
about this. Maybe she can give me a pill or something.
Phoebe| Yeah. Yeah, thats what you need a goodpill.
[Scene| Central Perk, Joey and Ross are there as Mona enters.]
Mona| Hey! (To Joey) Hey!
Ross| Hi!
Mona| Hi! Look! I got our pictures developed from Rockefeller Center.
Ross| Oh great! Hey-hey Joey, do you want to check out pictures of me and Mona
ice skating?
Joey| Oh uh, ordinarily I would love too, but I am just swamped right now.
(Brushes something off of his shirt and looks around, but doesnt move from his
chair.)
Ross| Hey where-where are the pictures that creepy pretzel vendor took of us
together?
Mona| Oh yeah, probably at the end. (Flips to the end.) Oh my God! He only took
pictures of my breasts!
Joey| Im missin picture time?! (Jumps over to look, Ross glares at
him and he retreats.)
Phoebe| (sitting down next to Ross) Yknow she has a face Ross!
Mona| Okay. Okay, heres a good one of us.
Ross| Wow! That is a good one! Wow, it looks like a, like a holiday card
yknow, with the tree in the middle and the skaters and the snow.
Mona| Yknow, every year I say Im gonna send out holiday cards and I
never do it. Do you wanna, do you wanna send this one out together?
Ross| (pause) Together? Like-like to people?
Mona| Yeah, yknow. Happy holidays from Mona and Ross. Itll be cute,
okay?
Ross| Okay. (Not happy about it.)
Mona| Oh, I gotta get to work. So call me later?
Ross| Uh sure, sure.
Mona| Bye guys.
Phoebe| Bye.
Joey| (To Ross) Congratulations! You just got married!
Ross| I know. Can you believe that?
Phoebe| Wait, Im-Im sorry. Whats the big deal about a holiday
card?
Ross| Married couples send out cards, families send out cards, people who have
been dating for a couple of months do not send out cards! What-what is she crazy?!
Joey| Hey-hey-hey, hey thats your wife youre talking about!
[Scene| Chandlers Office, his boss Doug is entering, Monica is there as well.]
Doug| Bing! Ho! And the Bing-ette!
Chandler| Honey, you remember my boss Doug right?
Monica| Yes, hi.
Doug| Hi. So good news, the divorce is final. I signed the papers this A.M.
Chandler| I didnt know you and Carol were getting divorced, Im
sorry.
Doug| Sorry? Finally chewed my leg out of that bear trap. Hey, congratulations
to you guys though!
Monica| No leg-chewing for us sir.
Doug| Oh well, give it time. So the divorce, the marriage, weve got a lot
to celebrate. How about we all go out to dinner tomorrow night?
Monica| I cant think of anything were doing. (Quietly) Why
cant I think of anything were doing?
Doug| Tomorrow night it is then, I should be out of court by six. They keep
throwing these sexual harassment cases at me and I keep knocking them out of the park!
Monica| Okay, Ill see you tomorrow! (Doug exits.) Just so you know,
were not seeing him tomorrow. (Chandler wonders why.) I-I cannot spend another
evening with that man. Do you remember how he behaved at our wedding?
Chandler| No.
Monica| Thats because he wasnt invited because of the way he behaved
at our engagement party.
Chandler| Oh yeah. Boy, urine cuts right through an ice sculpture
doesnt it?
[Scene| Ross's Apartment, theres a knock on the door and he opens it to Mona.]
Mona| Hi!
Ross| Hey!
Mona| Hey, I went by the photo shop, take a look, here is a mockup of our card.
What do you think?
Ross| Huh. Wow, this is great.
Mona| Now, do you think it should say, "Love Ross and Mona?"
Ross| Well, we-we havent said that to each other yet, but I guess its okay
to say it to other people.
Mona| How many did you want? Im getting a hundred.
Ross| A hundred?! Well, I-I guess Ill take aMona, uhI-Im
not sure about the whole uh, card thing.
Mona| Really? Why not?
Ross| Sending out a holiday card, together, I mean I just dont know if
were really quite there yet.
Mona| Oh yknow, I didnt think of it that way. Youre right.
Youre right. So, can I ask you a question?
Ross| Yeah.
Mona| Where are we?
Ross| Huh.
Mona| Yknow, like where are we? Where is this relationship going?
Ross| Hmm
Mona| I mean I love spending time with you, yknow I justI hope
were moving forward. I mean, we should probably talk about that. Dont you
think?
Ross| Lets do the card!
Mona| What?
Ross| The card! I think were there!
Mona| Okay. IBut I think we should still have this conversation.
Ross| Really?! I mean, even with the card?
[Scene| Rachels Doctors Office, she is waiting for her doctor as a nurse
enters.]
Nurse| Hi!
Rachel| Hi!
Nurse| Just so you know, Dr. Long cant be here today, she was called to
the hospital, so Dr. Schiff will be seeing you.
Rachel| Oh, okay. Hey, can I ask you a question? Was it me, or-or was the guy
who took my blood sample really cute? Yknow who Im talking about, bald
haircut, hairy fingers (Stops when she realizes it was her.)
Dr. Schiff| (entering) Hi Rachel? Im Dr. Schiff. (By the way, hes an
attractive man.)
Rachel| Yes, you are.
Dr. Schiff| So, hows it going?
Rachel| Oh, really, really good. But enough about me, come on! Where-where are
you from? What do you do?
Dr. Schiff| Im a doctor.
Rachel| Right! Right! I-I actually meant in your spare time, do you cook? Do you
ski? Or do you just hang out with your wife or girlfriend?
Dr. Schiff| Uh, I dont have a wife or girlfriend, but I do like to ski.
Rachel| Oh, I love to ski! How amazing is this?!
Dr. Schiff| So, are you experiencing any discomfort?
Rachel| No. Im very comfortable.
Dr. Schiff| Any painful gas?
Rachel| No! Shoot, Dr. Schiff what kind of question is that?!
Dr. Schiff| Okay then, would you like to lie down on the table?
Rachel| Well would you like me to lie down on the table?
Dr. Schiff| Im sorry, is there something going on here?
Rachel| Do you feel it too?
[Scene| Central Perk, Monica and Phoebe are there as Rachel enters.]
Rachel| Hi.
Phoebe| Oh hey! So, how did your doctors appointment go?
Rachel| Well, lets see. Uh, they gave me cute doctor today and in the
middle of the exam I put my pinky in his chin dimple.
Phoebe| Oh my God.
Monica| Why did you do that?
Phoebe| Okay, remember that little problem I was having during my
fourth month of
pregnancy?
Monica| Oh yeah, the Evander Holyfield phase. Oh man you were so hard up you
practically came on to me.
Phoebe| You wish.
Monica| Hey, I couldve had you if I wanted you.
Phoebe| Oh yeah? Come and get it.
Rachel| Okay, even this is turning me on!
Ross| (entering) Hey!
Rachel| Oh hey! Hey Ross! Hey hows it, hows it going with you and
Mona? Are you guys still together?
Ross| Oh yeah, yeah were moving forward. Youll be getting our card!
Monica| You and Mona are doing a holiday card together?
Ross| Yeah, were not just doing a card! Yknow, she-she also wants to
have the conversation about where the relationship is going.
Phoebe| Ugh! Women!
Ross| I know! I know! Why do you guys need to have this conversation?! Huh? I
mean no self-respecting man would ask a woman, "So, where is this going?"
Rachel| Uh Ross? You asked me that.
Ross| Hey! You were a closed book! Okay? Im not a mind reader! Besides, I
hate those conversations. Im horrible at them. Really! Maybe-maybe I need kind of a
gesture. Yknow, something that says were moving forward without having to talk
about it.
Monica| Like asking her to move in with you?
Ross| Smaller than that.
Monica| Making her a mixed tape?
Ross| Uh, bigger than that.
Phoebe| Give her a key to your apartment.
Ross| Whoa-hello! We were closer with the mixed tape.
Monica| All right. Have you said, "I love you?" You could say, I love
you.
Ross| Yeah I-I dont-I dont think Im quite there yet, but I
could say I looove spending time with you.
Phoebe| No, we hate that.
Monica| That is a slap in the face.
Ross| Forget it. I-IYknow what? Ill just have the
conversation. Ill just say I like things the way they are, and hope for the best.
What do you think Rach?
Rachel| I think, if it was a little colder in here I could see your nipples
through that sweater.
[Scene| Chandlers Office, Doug is entering.]
Doug| Bing! Were all set for tonight, 8 oclock.
Chandler| Oh uh, as it turns out, we cant do it. Monica has to work.
Doug| Oh, my ex-wife didnt work, unless you call turning into her mother
work. Fine. Tomorrow night then.
Chandler| Oh uh well tomorrows no good for her either.
Doug| Oh? Why not?
Chandler| Its the semi-finalsof herbotchy ball tournament.
Doug| Whats going on Bing? Does uh, your wife have a problem with me or
something?
Chandler| Well now-now youre just talking crazy.
Doug| So why cant the three of us go out together?
Chandler| Because uhwe-wewe split up. Monica and I split up. Hold
me.
Doug| Good God Bing Iwell I cant say Im altogether surprised,
I saw the way she looked at you, and there was no love there. And the way she looked at
me, pure lust.
Chandler| Yknow what would really help me through this tough time is
choking something. Can I choke ya?
Doug| Bing my boy, were gonna get you over this. Now heres the plan,
grab your coat, were going to a strip club.
Chandler| Oh no-no-no, Monica would freak. (Doug looks at him.) But to hell with
that bitch.
[Scene| Central Perk, Ross is getting Mona some coffee.]
Ross| Here we go. Mona umm, I think its time we-we had a conversation
about-about where things are with us.
Mona| Yeah, I-I think I suggested that.
Ross| Aw, we-we are so(Motions that theyre connected.) So umm, well
I-I-I like you and I-I love umm, yknow hanging out with you. And I mean-Im
having a lot of fun. (He pauses and thinks there might be more, but decides there
isnt.)
Mona| Okay.
Ross| I mean, theres no point in spending time with someone if-if
its just fun. Its gotta be, its gotta be going somewhere right? So
where-where is it going? (Pause) Ah! Thats-thats the real question. And-and
the answer isis its going somewherefun. Now I-I know what youre
thinking, fun was fine for you like ten years ago yknow, but youre-youre
not getting any younger. No I meanNo not you, not you, youyou are
getting younger. I meanyou-you look like youre getting younger by the
secondWhats your secret?
Mona| Im sorry, so umm, so where are we?
Ross| Well, well to sum up, were having fun, you look young.
Mona| Okay
Ross| But thats not enough. So Soheres a key to my
apartment. (Hands her his key.)
Mona| Really?!
Ross| Really.
Mona| You dont think this is too fast.
[Scene| Joey and Rachel's, Ross is telling Rachel and Monica about yet another mistake
hes made with a woman.]
Rachel| You gave her a key to your apartment?!
Ross| Not just a key, I gave her the only key! I am now a homeless person in a
very serious relationship.
Phoebe| (entering with some guy) Hey. Ooh Ross! Howd the conversation go?
Ross| Oh great, I live on the street.
Phoebe| Where?! (Ross exits.)
Rachel| Hey!
Phoebe| Hi! Okay, Monica, Rachel, this is my friend Roger.
Roger| Hey everybody.
Monica| Hi Roger.
Phoebe| So umm, Im gonna get us some drinks. (To Rachel) Would you help me
out?
Rachel| Yeah. (They go into the kitchen.)
Phoebe| Umm, hes here to have sex with you.
Rachel| What?
Phoebe| Youre welcome.
Rachel| Phoebe no!
Phoebe| Its okay, hes a virgin.
Monica| Rachel umm, I was just talking to this guy and I think hell have
sex with you.
Phoebe| Yeah, okay lets leave these two alone.
Rachel| No! I do not care what my hormones are doing, I am not going to just do
it with some random guy!
Phoebe| Fine! Then you tell Roger because he was really looking forward to this!
(Phoebe exits.)
[Scene| A Strip Club, Doug and Chandler are there.]
Doug| Oh Bing, look at those twin sisters dancing together. Let me buy you a lap
dance with those girls. Huh?
Chandler| Oh thats all right sir, and thats just one girl.
Doug| BingWhats this?! (Grabs his hand.)
Chandler| Its a hand. Its a thing you use as a Jack and Coke
holder.
Doug| No, its a wedding ring. You gotta get rid of it. Were gonna go
to the East River right now and throw it in there!
Chandler| Oh no-no-no!
Doug| Oh yeah-yeah-yeah, yknow I did it and I felt a hell of a lot better
and if you whip it just right you might hit a seagull in the head.
[Scene| Ross's Apartment, a locksmith has finished changing the locks on Rosss
door.]
Ross| Okay, and oh Im gonna need a bunch of extra keys. Apparently I give
them away for no reason at all.
Mona| (entering) Hey Ross, whats going on? You changing the lock?
Ross| No. That guy is.
Mona| I dont understand. You-you give me a key to your apartment and then
you change the lock.
Locksmith| Good luck buddy. (Exits.)
Mona| Umm, I-I thought we were moving forward and now youre-youre
sending me all these mixed signals. What are you trying to tell me?
Ross| Im trying to tell you I made you a mix tape.
Mona| What?
Ross| I love you!
Mona| Ohh! (Hugs him.) And I love spending time with you. (Ross isnt
happy.)
[Scene| Monica and Chandler's, Monica is eating dinner as Chandler enters.]
Chandler| Hi honey Im home.
Monica| From the tequila factory?
Chandler| It was awful. To get out of going to dinner with Doug I told him that
you and I split up. So then he took me to all these strip clubs and sleazy bars, and then
when I wouldnt give him my wedding ring, he threw a soda can at a bird!
Monica| Come here. I can breath through my mouth.
Chandler| Yknow what the worse part was? I got to see what my life would
be like without you. It was like Its a Wonderful Life with lap dances. Please
promise that you will never leave me, that we will grow old together, and be with each
other for the rest of our lives.
Monica| I promise. Hey, speaking of together, how about we send out a holiday
card this year?
Chandler| Ooh, I dont know if were there yet.
[Scene| Joey and Rachel's, Rachel is on the phone.]
Rachel| Yes. Hi, Id like to order a pizza. Okay, can I ask you a question?
Is-is the cute blond guy delivering tonight? Very Ambercrombie & Fitch. (Joey
enters.) Ill call you back.
Joey| Who was that?
Rachel| Its just the pizza place.
Joey| You hung up on the pizza place? I dont hang up on your friends.
Rachel| Im sorry honey, Im just having a, having a rough day.
Joey| Oh, whats wrong?
Rachel| Oh you really, you really just dont want to hear about it.
Joey| Then why did I ask?
Rachel| Okay, its justand this is really embarrassingbut
lately with this whole pregnancy thing Im just finding myselfhow do I put this
umm, erotically charged.
Joey| Is that college talk for horny?
Rachel| Yeah. So yknow, I have all of these feelings and I dont know
what to do about them, because I cant date like a normal person, which is fine
because I dont need a relationship, I mean all I really want is one great night.
Just sex, yknow? No strings attached, no relationship, just with someone that I feel
comfortable with and who knows what hes doing. For just one great night, I mean is
that really sohardto find. (Looks at Joey.) So how was your day?
Joey| Good, I uh, I saw a pretty big pigeon.
Rachel| Well, I gotta get up early and its almost seven oclock.
Joey| Yeah, I gotta, I gotta go to my room too.
Rachel| Okay, good night!
Joey| Good night. (They both enter their rooms.)
Joey| (entering) I cant do it!
Rachel| (entering) I didnt ask you to do it!
Joey| Youre Rachel!
Rachel| Youre Joey!
Joey| Youre my friend!
Rachel| Right back at ya!
Joey| But plus, it would be wrong and weird and-and-and bad.
Rachel| And so bad. I dont even know what youre talking about
because I didnt ask you to do anything!
Joey| I know!
Joey| Do you wanna do it?
Rachel| No!
Joey| All right, me neither! I was just testing you!
Rachel| Thats the end of this conversation!
Joey| This conversation never happened!
Rachel| Never happened! Good night!
Joey| Good night!
Joey| Get back in there! (Rachel re-enters her room and closes the door.)
[Scene| Joey and Rachel's, Rachel is there as Phoebe enters.]
Phoebe| Hi. Listen, Im sorry about that whole thing with Roger. It really
wasnt right, and I, and I want to make it up to you, so umm, I brought you something
that I think youll really enjoy. (Goes into the hallway and returns carrying the
Evander Holyfield cutout.) Now, this is just a loan. Okay? Im gonna, Im gonna
want him back. So (Looks at him longingly) Im gonna go now. (Exits.) (Pause)
(Entering) Im sorry, I thought I could do it and I cant! (She grabs the cutout
and exits for good.)

[Scene| Monica and Chandler's, Monica and Chandler are entering carrying groceries and
find Phoebe already there standing in front of a huge object that has been gift wrapped.]
Phoebe| Hey! I got you a present!!
Chandler| Oh my goodness! Where did you hide it?
Phoebe| I got it for your wedding and I ordered it weeks ago, and it finally got
here!
Chandler| Pheebs you didnt have to get us anything for our wedding you
already sang
Monica| (interrupting) I love it! Its huge!! Lets open it! Open it!!
(Monica rips open the paper.)
Phoebe| Its a Ms. Pac-Man machine!!
Monica| Oh my God!
Phoebe| I didnt know where to put it so I just left it here for now.
Monica| Oh well, maybe we can put it in the guest bedroom.
Chandler| Oh, okay.
Monica| All right. (He goes to push it and it doesnt move.)
Chandler| I kinda like it here.
Phoebe| Do you really like it?
Monica| Are you kidding?! I practically spent my entire childhood at the arcade!
This is likeOh my, this is like my second favorite game!
Phoebe| Oh really? What was your first?
Monica| Well I-I really dont remember the name of it.
Chandler| Well what did it do?
Monica| Well, you justyou put a quarter in and yknow pull-pull some
handles and win like a candy bar or something.
Chandler| A vending machine?
Monica| Dont feel bad for me! I won like every time!
[Scene| Central Perk, Joey and Rachel are there as Ross enters.]
Ross| Hey! Oh, Im so glad you guys are here. Ive been dying to tell
someone what happened in the Paleontology department today.
Joey| (To Rachel) Do you think he saw us or can we still sneak out?
Ross| Professor Neuman, the head of the department, so.
Rachel| They made you head of the department!
Ross| No, I get to teach one of his advanced classes! (Pause) Why didnt I
get head of the department? (Goes and gets some coffee.)
Joey| Oh! Hey Rach, listen umm
Rachel| Yeah.
Joey| I got a big date coming up, do you know a good restaurant?
Rachel| Uh, Pauls Café. They got great food and its really
romantic.
Joey| Ooh, great! Thanks!
Rachel| Yeah! Oh, and then afterwards you can take her to the Four Seasons
for drinks. Or you go downtown and listen to some jazz. Or dancingOh! Take her
dancing!
Joey| You sure are naming a lot of ways to postpone sex, Ill tell ya
Rachel| Ooh, I miss dating. Gettin all dressed up and going to a fancy
restaurant. Im not gonna be able to do that for so long, and its so much fun!
I mean not that sitting at home worrying about giving birth to a sixteen pound baby is not
fun.
Joey| Hey, yknow what?
Rachel| Huh?
Joey| Why dont I take you out?
Rachel| What?! Joey, you dont want to go on a date with a pregnant lady.
Joey| Yes I do! And were gonna go out, were gonna have a good time,
and take your mind off of childbirth and c-sections and-and giant baby heads stretching
out
Rachel| (interrupting) Okay! Ill go with ya! Ill go! Ill go
with ya.
Joey| Ill be fun.
Rachel| All right?
[Scene| Monica and Chandler's, Monica is watching Phoebe play Ms. Pac-Man.]
Phoebe| No. No! Yes! Ahh. Oh, would you look at that Monica? I just knocked off
all of your top scores, how sad.
Monica| Okay, Im next. (Phoebe starts another game.) Dont!
Dont start another game! I said Im next! Phoebe!
Phoebe| Oh, Im sorry. I didnt hear you over all the winning.
Monica| Chandler! Phoebes hogging the game!
Chandler| Who cares? Its a stupid game.
Monica| You only think its stupid because you suck at it.
Chandler| I dont suck. Its sucks. You suck.
Phoebe| Wait okay, if this game is gonna cause problems between the two of you,
then maybe I should just keep it.
Monica| No! No-no! I love it! It is a great present! In fact, why dont you
go home and wait for the thank you card?
Chandler| Why do you want to play this game so bad?
Phoebe| Yeah! Its not like it spits out a Clark bar after every
game.
Monica| Okay. Phoebe thats it. Come on, get outout of the chair. Get
out! (She goes to move Phoebe, but Phoebe goes limp and Monica cant move her.) Oh
comePhoebe!
[Scene| Joey and Rachel's, Rachel is getting ready for her date with Joey as there is a
knock on the door.]
Rachel| Joey? Could you get that? (There is no answer and she goes and opens the
door to Joey.) What are you doing here? I thought you were in your room?
Joey| No, Im picking you up for our date. These are for you. (Hands her
some flowers.)
Rachel| Ohh, Lilies. Joey, theyre my favorite. Thank you.
Joey| And, a brownie! (Hands her a bag with the brownie in it.) Well, half a
brownie. Actually, its just bag. Its been a long walk from the flower shop and
I was startin to feel faint so
Rachel| Oh man! This is so great! I actually feel like Im going on a real
date! Although, I have a hint of morning sickness, and Im wearing underwear that
goes up to about(She snaps the waistband on her underwear that is just slightly
below her breasts)there.
Joey| Hey come on now, this is a real date. Uh, sonice place you got here.
Foosball, huh? Pizza box. Oh, a subscription to Playboy, my kind of woman.
Rachel| Yeah, actually thats my roommates.
Joey| I would like to meet him. He sounds like a stand up guy.
Rachel| Ah yes, but hes very protective of me so youd better watch
yourself.
Joey| Ah Hey, so this roommate of yoursis he good looking?
Rachel| Hm-mmm.
Joey| Oh yeah, it must be tough to keep your hands of him, huh?
Rachel| (laughs) Yeah, but Im pretty sure hes gay.
Joey| No-no-no-no, hes not! No! Why are you trying to ruin the game? Come
on!
[Scene| N.Y.U, Ross is teaching a class.]
Ross| which brings us back, of course, to Greelys theory of dominance.
(The bell rings.) Okay, that-thats all for today. Oh, uh does anyone know where the
Freeman building is?
Student| Yeah, its the new building on Avenue A.
Ross| What?! That-thats all the way cross town, Im supposed to teach
a graduate seminar there in ten minutes.
Student| Ooh, dude. Thats not gonna happen.
Ross| Move it! Move it! Move it!! Hey!!! Im the teacher!!
[Scene| The Freeman Building, Ross is entering his new class completely out of breath.]
Ross| Hello. (He throws his jacket towards the coat rack and misses.) Im
sorry Im a little late. Ah(Checks his watch)Whoa! A lot late. Let me
start by uh, by introducing myself, I am Professor Geller. (The bell rings.) So to sum up,
Im Professor Geller. Good job today.
[Scene| A Restaurant, a waitress is taking Joey and Rachels dinner order.]
Rachel| Now the filet mignon, what comes with that?
Waitress| Theres a side of steamed vegetables.
Rachel| Emmm. Now, instead of the vegetables, is there anyway I can substitute
the three-pound lobster?
Joey| Yknow what? Bring her both, and Ill have the same. (The
waitress leaves.)
Rachel| Wow! This is shaping up to be a pretty good dateOh, I almost
forgot. I didnt pay you the rent check.
Joey| Oh whoa-whoa-whoa, no roommate stuff. Okay? Were on a date.
Rachel| Okay. Wow! So I get to see what Joey Tribbiani is like on a date. So do
you have any moves?
Joey| No! No. Umm, just myself and if they dont like me for(Laughs.)
Im sorry I couldnt even get through that.
Rachel| I knew it! I knew it. Come on tell me your moves.
Joey| Oh alright. Umm, well, okay, I usually start by having a bottle of wine
sent to my table from a fan.
Rachel| Oh my God. And that works?!
Joey| Well it does when you combine it with, "This is so embarrassing, I
just want to have a normal life!"
Rachel| Oh, you poor little famous man.
Joey| Oh okay, how about this one. I was gonna wait until the end of the night
to kiss you, but youre so beautifulI dont think I can.
Rachel| (looks interested) Oh my God! Wow! That was fantastic, I almost leaned
in. I really almost did!
Joey| Alright, soso tell me one of your moves.
Rachel| Alright. So whered you grow up?
Joey| Thats your move? Boy Rach, youre lucky youre hot.
Rachel| Come on, just answer the question!
Joey| (exasperated) Queens.
Rachel| And so were-were you close to your parents?
Joey| Yeah, with my mom. Yeah, not so much with my dad.
Rachel| Why not?
Joey| I dont know. I guess theres just always been this distance
yknowI mean we both try to pretend its not there, but it is.
Rachel| (sympathetic) Oh. (Starts rubbing his wrist with her fingers.) Its
gotta be rough.
Joey| Yeah, it is. Its really tough. Yknow sometimes I
thinkWow!! Nice move!
Rachel| Huh?
Joey| "Whered you grow up," its so simple!
Rachel| Thank you! And now if youll excuse me, I have to go to the rest
room.
Joey| Yeah.
Rachel| And now youre watching me walk away.
Joey| Yes I am! Again so simple!
[Scene| Monica and Chandler's, Monica is entering to find Chandler playing Ms.
Pac-Man.]
Monica| Hey.
Chandler| You are not going to believe what I did today!
Monica| Well it clearly wasnt showering or shaving.
Chandler| I got good. I played this game all day and now I rule at it! They
should change the name of it to Ms. Chandler. (Pause) Although I-I hope they dont.
Monica| Wait a minute, you stayed home all day and played Ms. Pac-Man
while I went off to work like some kind of chump?!
Chandler| Uh-huh, and I got all the top ten scores, I erased Phoebe off the
board! High five! (Holds up his hand to give Monica a high five, only he cant
straighten his fingers.)
Monica| What is the matter with your hand?
Chandler| Well Ive been playing it for like eight hours, itll loosen
up. Come on, check out the scores. Oh, and also look at the initials, theyre dirty
words.
Monica| Chandler, why would you do that?
Chandler| Because its awesome.
Monica| You think this is clever?
Chandler| Well yknow, they only give you three letters, so after A-S-S it
is a bit of a challenge.
Monica| Hey wait a minute, this one isnt dirty.
Chandler| It is when you put it together with that one.
Monica| Ah, well if you dont clear this off, you wont be getting one
of those from me. But Bens coming over here tomorrow to play this game, this
cant be there.
Chandler| Come on, he wont even know what they mean.
Monica| Chandler! Hes seven; hes not stupid.
Chandler| Have you talked to him lately?
Monica| All right, look Im just gonna unplug it.
Chandler| No-no-no, if you unplug it, Ill have nothing to show for my day!
It would be like I was at work. (She unplugs it.) No! (And plugs it back in.) Hey look at
that! Look at that, its still there! This thing must have some kind of primitive ROM
(Read Only Memory, its a memory chip.) Chip in it or something!
Monica| Honey you-you got to beat your scores!
Chandler| With the claw?!
Monica| All right fine. Fine, Ill do it. Ive just got to get this
off the screen. Carol and Susan are still upset that you taught him pull my finger.
Chandler| (smiles) Pull my finger(Looks at his hand)My hand is
messed up.
[Scene| Joey and Rachel's, Joey and Rachel are returning from their date.]
Rachel| I am not gonna answer that!
Joey| Oh come on! Just pick one! Between Monica, Phoebe, Chandler, and Ross if
you had to, if you had to, who would you punch?
Rachel| No one! They are my friends, I wouldnt punch any of them.
Joey| Chandler?
Rachel| Yeah, but I dont know why. Look at me, Im having such a
wonderful time!
Joey| Me too! Hey Rach, can I just say I think this is the best date I ever had!
Rachel| I know!
Joey| I never laughed so hardDid you see the wine come out of my nose?
Rachel| Joey, I think everyone saw the wine come out of your nose.
Joey| I gotta say, I never knew I could enjoy the non-sex part of the date so
much.
Rachel| Well that is because you have never been on a date with me before.
Joey| Huh. Huh.
Rachel| All right, now dont judge me. I normally wait until my date
leaves, but you live here. Im ripping into this swan.
Joey| Ah! Okay, well then you dont judge me. Im gonna suck on the
cellophane from the brownie I had before. (They both do as they planned.)
Rachel| So tell me, what are Joey Tribbianis end of the night moves?
Joey| Ah, well, if I want the girl to kiss me, first thing I do is make my lips
look irresistible.
Rachel| How do you do that?
Joey| Now you cant tell anyone, but uhI put on shiny lip balm.
Rachel| Oh my God!
Joey| Yeah, like a moth to a flame, Im telling ya. Okay all right, so now
you go.
Rachel| No, I dont want to tell you.
Joey| Why not?
Rachel| Because its embarrassing.
Joey| More embarrassing than shiny raspberry lip balm?! (Rachel just looks at
him.) I didnt say raspberry before did I? All right just-just tell me Rach, just
tell me!
Rachel| (laughs) Okay. All right, stand up. (They do so.) Well, when were
at the door, I lightly press my lips against his, and then move into his body just for a
second, and then I make this sound, "Hmmm." Okay, I know it doesnt sound
like anything, but I swear it works.
Joey| (stunned and turned on) Yeah. WhyYeah, that would work for ya
Rachel| All right, I gotta go to bed. Honey, I had such a wonderful time.
Joey| Oh. (She kisses him.) Yeah. (She goes into her room.) Me to. (He then
starts to freak out.)
[Scene| Central Perk, Ross is telling Rachel about his class location predicament.]
Rachel| you were 50 minutes late to the class, what did you crawl there?!
Ross| No, I ran. It was really far, and when did people stop understanding the
phrase, "Get the hell out of my way!"
Rachel| Well, why didnt you just take a cab?
Ross| Ugh, between the traffic that time of day and all the one-way streets
itll take me twice as long. Besides, I teach the class three times a week, who am I?
Rockefeller?
Rachel| Well youre not gonna be able to keep doing this.
Ross| Well I have to. Okay? If I dont, theyll take the class away
from me. AndI already put it in my family newsletter.
Rachel| You what?
Ross| Youve seen it, the Geller Yeller.
Rachel| Right. Wow!
Ross| Besides, I-I think I figured out a much faster route, Im sure I can
make it this time. I justI just cant be afraid to get a little bithit by
cars. (He goes to the bathroom as Joey enters.)
Joey| Hey!
Rachel| Hi! Hey, remember how last night we were talking about that movie Cujo?
Joey| Oh yeah, I still cant believe you havent seen Cujo.
What is wrong with you?
Rachel| Relax! Its not like its Citizen Kane!
Joey| Have you ever tried to sit through Citizen Kane?
Rachel| Yeah I know its really boring, but its like a big deal.
Anyway, I was thinking about renting Cujo sometime.
Joey| Oh yeah? All right, lets do it tonight.
Rachel| Well dont you have that big date tonight?
Joey| Oh right!
Rachel| Hey Joey, can I ask you something?
Joey| Yeah.
Rachel| After our date last night, did you feel a little weird?
Joey| Oh my God! You did too? It totally freaked me out, what was that?!
Rachel| I dont know! (Pause) Im-Im kinda thinking it-it was
the lobster
Joey| Oh yeah-yeah, the lobster.
Rachel| Yeah, I mean I was up sick all night.
Joey| Yeah me too, all night.
Rachel| Really?! How come we didnt cross paths?
Joey| Yeah well thats because uhI stayed in my room. Yeah, you
dont want to look in my hamper.
[Scene| Monica and Chandler's, Monica is trying to erase Chandlers dirty words
while he looks on.]
Monica| Okay, I got that. Ill escape over there. Ill come back over
here. All right, come on Ms. Pac-Man. Its gotRight(She dies.)
Well, youre just a little bitch, arent you?
Phoebe| (entering) Hey, you guys. Listen, Im sorry that I was hogging the
game before(Sees the top ten list)Oh my God! Your friends have some
unfortunate initials!
Monica| Theyre all Chandler.
Phoebe| Chandler sucks! He couldnt have gotten this good!
Chandler| I did. (Looks at his still deformed hand) But it came at a price.
Monica| But Ben is coming over tonight and he cant see this.
Chandler| Oh come on, by age seven kids have already seen orgies. (They both
look at him.) Was it just me?!
[Scene| N.Y.U, Rosss new class, he is entering out of breath.]
Ross| Yeah!!!! Yes, I made it! Im on time! (Grabs a bottle of water from a
student, takes a drink, and splashes some on his face like the marathon runners do.) Okay,
why dont we all uh, (Exhales loudly) open our books to page 23. Where (Exhales
again) Where you will seea uha bunch of uhred spots. Okay, (Closes his
book.) umm, why dont, why dont you all start to read, while I(Passes out
and collapses.)
[Scene| A Restaurant, Joey is on his hot date and theyre not speaking right now.]
Joey's Date| Hey. Are you all right? You seem a little distracted.
Joey| No-no! Im fine. Its just Hey, can I ask you something?
Have you ever looked at someone that youve known for a while and then
suddenlysuddenly see them a different way?
Joey's Date| You mean like from behind?
Joey| Yeah. Yeah, thatthats exactly it. Youre right. Yeah.
Joey's Date| Ew, yknow what? One time I saw this guy from behind and he
seemed like a totally normal guy and then he turned around and it was Stephan Baldwin!
Joey| (deadpan) Ooh! Yeah. So yeah, so you know exactly what Im talking
about.
Joey's Date| Totally! Wow! (Pause) Would you excuse me for a sec?
Joey| Oh yeah, sure. (She gets up, walks towards the bathroom, and Joey watches
her go.) Ehhh.
[Scene| Monica and Chandler's, now its Phoebes turn to erase Chandler from
the board.]
Monica| Oh my God Phoebe, youre on fire!
Phoebe| I know!
Chandler| One more score to go! You can do it! (Touches her shoulder.)
Phoebe| Dont touch me!!
Monica| Dont touch her!!
Chandler| All right! Go left! Go left! Go right!! Go right!!
Phoebe| I cant!! I cant!! (She dies.) Noooooooo!!!!!!! You son of a
bitch!!!!!
Ross| Phoebe!!
Phoebe| Oh hi BenNo!! Dont look at the machine! (Covers the screen.)
[Scene| Joey and Rachel's, Rachel is watching Cujo while Joey returns from his
date scaring Rachel.]
Rachel| Oh God! Thank God youre home! Im watching Cujo.
Joey| (incredulous) Alone?!
Rachel| Yes! But what is wrong with this dog?!
Joey| Hey, did you get to the part where theyre trapped in the car and
Cujos throwin himself at the windshield?
Rachel| No! No! Seriously, whats wrong with the dog?! Wait a minute, what
are you doing home so early? What happened to your date?
Joey| Oh uh, it didnt work out.
Rachel| Oh. Do you want to watch the rest of the movie with me?
Joey| Oh uh, okay. Yeah.
Rachel| Yknow, I never thought Id say this about a movie, but I
really hope this dog dies. (Joey brings over a stool at sits on it next to Rachel
whos in the big chair.) What are you doing over there? Come sit here, you protect
me.
Joey| Oh sure, yeah, why not? (Sits on the arm of the chair.)
Rachel| Okay. (Pushes play.) Okay, thats him! Thats him! Thats
Cujo! Thats Cujo!
Joey| All right, I know! I know. Yeah, itll be okay.
Rachel| Oh my God.Whats he gonna do now? I cant watch! (Drags
Joey closer to her and cowers into his chest.) Oh. Seriously, how can you watch this?
Arent you scared?
Joey| Terrified. (But for a totally different reason.)
[Scene| N.Y.U, Rosss new class, this time hes actually about to do a
lecture.]
Ross| So is everybody here? I got here a little early myself. Let us begin. Now,
the hydrosaurids have been unearthed in two main locations. (He moves to the map and we
see why he made it to class on time, hes wearing in-line skates and hasnt
taken them off.) Here. (Points to the map, somewhere in the Middle East, then spins on the
skates and points to the map.) Here. (China.) Now as for the hydrosaurs

whats up?
Phoebe| Well, I left my guitar here again.
Monica| Oh, okay. No problem.
Phoebe| Okay. (Monica closes the door, gets the guitar, and then hands it out.)
Monica| Okay.
Phoebe| Oh.
Monica| Here you go.
Phoebe| Okay.
Monica| Okay.
Phoebe| Great! Umm(Monica closes the door again and Phoebe knocks again.)
Monica| What?!
Phoebe| So do you want to hang out or something?
Monica| Phoebe! You kinda caught me at a bad time.
Phoebe| Oh are you and Chandler
Monica| Yes! Exactly.
Phoebe| Okay. Do you guys want me to play for you?
Monica| (laughs) No. (Closes the door as Chandler walks up.)
Chandler| Hey Pheebs, whats up?
Phoebe| You ask an intriguing question Chandler Bing.
Phoebe| Oh my God! Youre getting a massage! You never let me massage you!!
Monica| Phoebe, I can explain!
Phoebe| You told me you hate massages!
Chandler| Buy stamps, pick up dry cleaningDont let Phoebe in.
Phoebe| I cant believe this! How long as this been going on?
Monica| Well umm, Alexandra has been
Phoebe| Oh, it has a name?
Monica| Phoebe, dont get upset!
Phoebe| OkayOop! Too late! Im leaving! Come on Chandler lets
go! (She storms out.)
Chandler| Well, Phoebe I thought Id(Off Phoebes
look)Yeah, what the hell. (Exits with Phoebe.)
[Scene| Joeys Bedroom, Joey is having a dream about Rachel giving birth with him
as the father.]
Joey| Oh okay, okay! One more push! One more push! Come on honey, were
almost there! Were almost there!
Rachel| Oh Joey, Im so happy things worked out for us that were
having this baby together. I love you so much.
Joey| Oh, I love you too.
Rachel| And I hope its not an inappropriate time to say this but,
youre the best sex I ever had.
Joey| Thats always appropriate! (Back to the matter at hand) Oh, okay. One
more push! One more push!
Doctor| Oh, here is your beautiful baby. Congratulations!
Ross| (crying) I hope youre a better father than youre a friend!!
(Cries again and Joey wakes up in horror.)
Rachel| (bursts into the room) Joey! Joey!
Joey| What? Whats going on?
Rachel| Come feel this! Come feel my belly!
Joey| Aaaah
Rachel| Joey! The baby is kicking for the first time! Will you please come feel
this?!
Joey| Really?!
Rachel| Yes!
Joey| Oh, yknow what? Maybe uh, youyou should come to me. Im a
not, Im not wearing any bottoms.
Rachel| Oh, okay! (She goes over to him and he feels her belly.)
Joey| Oh my, oh my God!
Rachel| Aw, its unbelievable! Wow! She is kicking so much! Oh, shes
like ummohwhos that kind of annoying girl soccer player?
Joey| Mia Hamm?
Rachel| Mia Hamm!
Joey| Oh thats amazing. (Drops the sheet.)
Rachel| (looking down) Oh-oh!! One hand on the sheet Joe!
Joey| Whoa-hey-oh! Sorry!
[Scene| Monica and Chandler's, Monica has opened another wedding present as Chandler
enters.]
Chandler| Hey babe.
Monica| Hi honey. We just got a wedding gift from Bob and Faye Bing; they
dont like us do they? (They gave them a pok-a-dotted punch bowl.)
Chandler| Who says you cant get a nice punch bowl for under six bucks?
Maybe we can take it back?
Monica| No, it doesnt say where it came from. Where would we return it?
Chandler| How about to the street say from the balcony?
Monica| Why dont we just find a place for it?
Chandler| Okay. How about in that cabinet?
Monica| No! Thats where we keep the canned goods! Have you completely
forgotten everything you learned at orientation?
Chandler| How about the closet by the bathroom? (The secret green door by the
bathroom.)
Monica| Oh, okay. Here, why dont you let me do it?
Chandler| Oh no-no-no, I will do it. Honey, you have to learn to sit down and
relax and let your husband take care of things once and awhile. (Tries the door.)
Its locked, you have to help me. Why is it locked?
Monica| No reason. I-I keep private things in there.
Chandler| Oh yknow, Ive been living here a while and Ive never
seen whats inside that closet. What is, what is in there?
Monica| Feminine stuff.
Chandler| Dont try to make me uncomfortable with feminine stuff!
Monica| Chandler, there is nothing in there that concerns you! If you love me
you-youll let it go.
Chandler| Fine.
Monica| Thank you! (He tries the door again and Monica glares at him.)
Chandler| (walking casually away) Love you.
Phoebe| (entering) Hello Chandler, lovely day huh? (To Monica) You!
Chandler| Phoebe if it helps Alexandra has only been massaging Monica for like
three years. (Phoebe rolls her eyes and walks away and Monica glares at him.) If! I said,
"If it helps!" (Goes to the bedroom.)
Phoebe| Why wont you let me massage you?
Monica| Well itsI mean Id justId be
self-conscious. Youre my friend; Id be naked.
Phoebe| Monica! We lived together for years! Ive seen you naked!
Monica| Thats different, we were roommates! And when?!
Phoebe| Im curious about the human body.
Monica| Hey, come on Phoebe, you can understand why this would be weird for me.
Phoebe| But Im a professional! And Im really good! Look, if
youre uncomfortable we can stop. Just give me a chance, okay. Please?
Monica| Okay, if it means that much to you
Phoebe| It does! How would you feel if you couldnt share your cooking?
Or-or imagine how Ross would feel if he couldnt teach us about dragons.
Monica| Dinosaurs.
Phoebe| Potato, potaato.
[Scene| Central Perk, Joey and Rachel are there as Ross enters.]
Ross| Hey!
Joey| Hey Ross! The babys kicking!
Ross| What?! It is?! (He tries to quickly remove his gloves, but runs into
trouble and finally throws them off of his hands like a hockey player in a fight and grabs
Rachels belly.)
Rachel| Its not kicking right now. Although we would love to see you do
(Mimics him) that again.
Ross| Hey, when-when was it kicking? What happened?
Rachel| Last night! I just felt it and I went into Joeys room and he was
sleeping
Joey| A dreamless sleep.
Ross| My God, the babys kicking. Thats great. Although Ikinda
wish I-I wouldve been there to feel the kicking for the first time yknow.
Joey| Well I got stuff going on in here (Rubbing his belly) if you wanna feel.
Ross| Look, I-I dont want to miss anymore baby stuff. SoHere.
Heres my new pager number, okay? Anytime anything pregnancy related happens use it!
Ill be there! Okay? I dont care if its three in the morning and all you
want is ice cream.
Joey| Wow! Can I get a copy of that?
[Scene| Phoebe's Apartment, Monica is lying on the massage table waiting for Phoebe.]
Phoebe| (calling from her room) Are you under the sheet?
Monica| Yes.
Phoebe| (in a soothing voice) Great, lets begin. (She starts the massage.)
Hows the pressure?
Monica| Nice! Wow Phoebe you are good!
Phoebe| Stating the obvious, but thank you. And its not weird is it.
Monica| No. Ooohh
Phoebe| Thats right, you just enjoy.
Monica| (in a sexy voice) Oh. Oh yeah! Ohhhhh! Ohh! Oh yeah!
Phoebe| (getting uncomfortable) Okay.
Monica| Oh God Phoebe!! (Phoebe covers one ear.) Oh thats it! Thats
it! Right there! Oh! (Tries to cover the other ear.) Ooooh-oooh-ooooh (Covers both
ears and continues the massage with her elbows.)
[Scene| Monica and Chandler's, Chandler has a box of keys and is trying them on the
secret closet when someone enters.]
Chandler| I wasnt trying to open your closet! I wasnt trying to open
your closet! I swear! (Running into the kitchen and sees its Joey.)
Joey| Whoa, Monica runs a pretty tight ship over here. What are you doing?
Chandler| Monica has a secret closet and she wont let me see whats
in it.
Joey| Why not?
Chandler| I dont know! What could she possibly be hiding in here that I
cant see?!
Joey| I dont know. Ooh, I bet its Richard.
Chandler| Why would Monica be keeping Richard in here?
Joey| Well off the top of my head uhh, maybe shes having her cake and
eating it too. You being the cake and Richard being the too. Or!
Chandler| And here we go
Joey| I saw this movie once where there was a door and no one knew what was
behind it, and when they finally got it open millions and millions and millions of bugs
came pouring out and they feasted on human flesh. Yknow it wouldnt kill ya to
respect your wifes privacy! (He walks away and into his apartment and looks the
door.) Stupid closet full of bugs!
Rachel| Joey. Joey, something feels weird and not good weird. I
dontWhoa!! (Winces in pain.)
Joey| Oh hey whoa-whoa, dont worry. Okay. When my sisters were pregnant
they got every weird feeling in the book, it was always nothing.
Rachel| Really?
Joey| Absolutely. But, were gonna stop by the hospital just to be
sure, okay? Ill page Ross on the way. Come on.
Rachel| Okay. Oh GodOw!Oo!
Joey| Okay Rach-Rach-Rach look at me, look at me, everythings gonna be
fine, trust me. Okay. Take my hand. Here we go. (Rachel grabs his hand.) Oww crushing
bones!
[Scene| The Hospital, Joey is in the waiting room as Rachel comes back out with the
doctor.]
Joey| Hey! So?
Dr. Long| Shes fine. Shes experiencing Braxton-Hicks contractions,
mild discomfort caused by contractions in the uterine wall.
Rachel| Hmm, mild discomfort. So I take it youve had one of these Braxton
thingies?
Joey| So but everything is normal.
Dr. Long| Absolutely.
Joey| And-and theres no danger to her and the baby?
Dr. Long| No-no. Contractions can be unnerving if you dont know what they
are, but shes fine.
Rachel| Thank you doctor. (Dr. Long exits.) (To Joey) Oh thank you for being so
nice and calm.
Joey| Calm?! I wasnt calm! Ive never been more scared in all my
life!
Rachel| But wait you said everything was gonna be okay.
Joey| Well what do I know?! Im not a doctor!
Rachel| But IBut everything is okay. Im fine!
Joey| You sure?!
Rachel| Yes! Yes! I got half a mind to contract that doctors uterus
though. Mild discomfort, whats he talking about?
Joey| (seeing Ross) Oh hey-hey!
Ross| (rushes in) Is everything okay?
Rachel| Yeah, everythings fine!
Ross| Your page said come to the hospital, what? What was it? What happened?
Joey| Something called Braxton-Hicks contractions.
Ross| Oh. Oh. Thank God, most women dont even feel them.
Rachel| Okay, no uterus, no opinion.
Joey| Hey uh, whats with the candy?
Ross| Oh when you beeped me I was on line at the concession stand at the movie
theater.
Rachel| Oh you went to the movies by yourself?
Ross| No IMona!
Rachel| Oh, I gotta go back in there.
Ross| What? Why? Whats wrong?
Rachel| No, everythings fine. I just gotta go back
Ross| No really, you tell me whats up.
Rachel| I-I forgot my underwear. (Ross lets her go.)
Ross| (To Joey) So, thanks so much for bringing her to the hospital.
Joey| Oh hey, dont worry about it man. Dont worry about it, no big
deal.
Ross| Yeah but still, I mean it shouldve been me. Im the dad.
Dr. Long| (To Joey) Uh, if you have any questions, heres some information
on Braxton-Hicks. (Hands Joey a pamphlet.) Oh and by the way, you did the right thing by
bringing her in. Youre gonna make a wonderful father.
Joey| Oh uh, hey. Not as good as this guy! (Grabs Ross around the shoulders.) He
brought Twizlers!
[Scene| Monica and Chandler's, Joey and Chandler are still working on the door.]
Chandler| There has got to be a way!
Joey| Easy there Captain Kirk. Oh, do you have a bobby pin?
Chandler| Yeah. (Checks his hair.) Oh no wait, Im not an nine-year-old
girl.
Joey| Then why do you throw like one?
Chandler| Maybe Monica has a bobby pin.
Joey| Sure. "Monica."
Chandler| So, hows the hideously inappropriate crush on Rachel coming?
Joey| Uh, really good. Really good. Yeah, I should be ready to kill myself any
day now. (Chandler returns with a bobby pin and hands it to Joey.) Wow, you sure found
that quick. (He tries the pin in the lock.) I justI wish I didnt feel this way
about Rachel anymore, yknow? I wish things could go back to normal. I mean, I love
living with her and God, helping out with the baby is just amazing, but now I thinkI
think Ross feels left out. Yknow? When I had to take Rachel to the hospital, the
doctor thought I was the father. God You shouldve seen the look on Rosss
face. (Pause) By the way, I have no idea what Im doing here. For all I know Im
just locking it more. Oh hey, did you try opening it with a credit card?
Chandler| Thats a good idea.
Joey| Yeah.
Chandler| Okay. (They switch places and Chandler gets out a credit card.) So uh,
Ross is kinda bummed huh?
Joey| Oh, I justI feel terrible.
Chandler| Well, its not your fault. What are you gonna do? Not take her to
the hospital? Yknow? Youre doing nothing wrong. (Pause) Except for harboring
an all consuming love for the woman whose carrying his baby. (He loses his card behind the
door.) Richard? If-if youre in there, could you pass me my credit card?
[Scene| Central Perk, Phoebe is on the couch as Monica enters.]
Monica| Hey.
Phoebe| Hey.
Monica| I gotta tell you, yesterday was amazing. That massage felt so good!
Phoebe| No-no, I got that.
Monica| So umm, what do you say we make it a weekly appointment?
Phoebe| Okay. Okay but you should know though, Ive raised my rates to $200
an hour.
Monica| Okay.
Phoebe| I mean $500.
Monica| What?
Phoebe| 600.
Monica| Whats going on?
Phoebe| Oh, you make sex noises when you get massaged!
Monica| What? (Laughs.)
Phoebe| Yeah, and it really freaked me out! And after a while I even tried to
hurt you and it just spurred you on.
Monica| What?! Youre crazy! Theres nothing sexual about the noises I
make!
Phoebe| Really? Theres nothing sexual about this? (Sexily) Oooh. Oo God!
Ohh. Ohhhh. Ohh. (Some cute guy is watching closely.) (To him) What are you looking at?!
(Pause) I mean hi.
Monica| Oh myThis is so embarrassing. Oh my God, Im never gonna get
massaged again!
Phoebe| No, you cant let this stop you from getting massages! No look, I
have, I have lots of clients that make the same noises you do!
Monica| Really?!
Phoebe| Well not clients, lovers. But lets just yknow, try it again.
Come back and-and well work through it.
Monica| Are you sure?
Phoebe| Yes.
Monica| I guess.
Phoebe| Great! Okay, if youll just excuse me. (To the guy) So, did you
hear something you liked?
[Scene| Joey and Rachel's, Rachel is balancing an aluminum can on her stomach as Ross
enters.]
Rachel| Hey Ross! Check it out! I learned a new trick!
Ross| Hey uh, I brought you some lunch.
Rachel| Ohh! Thats so sweet of you! Oh yum! (Takes a bite out of the
sandwich and starts to get sick.) Did you put pickles on this?
Ross| Well yeah!
Rachel| Oh Ross!! (Runs to the bathroom and closes the door.)
Ross| What?! What?! Rach what?!
Joey| Whats going on?
Ross| I made her favorite, tuna salad with pickles.
Joey| Pickle? Pickles make her sick. Giving her pickles is like giving me salad.
Ross| (to Rachel) I-Im sorry Rach, I didnt know. Are you gonna be
okay?
Rachel| Yeah, Ill be fine. But could someone please make sure that
sandwich is gone when I get out there?
Joey| Im on it! (Takes a bite out of the sandwich.)
Ross| I cant believe this! I shouldnt be the one making her throw
up!
Joey| Dude relax! It could happen to anyone.
Ross| Yeah? Not to you, because you know this stuff. I dont know any of it
and Im the father. I wish Id be more involved yknow.
Rachel| (entering) Well, if anyone is keeping score, I no longer eat tuna.
Joey| Hey uh, can I, can I talk to you guys for a second?
Ross| Yeah.
Rachel| Whats up?
Joey| Uh, sit down. I wanna talk about our situation.
Rachel| (Gasps) Are you breaking up with us?
Joey| The thing iscause I live with Rachel Im here for a lot
of the stuff, okay? (To Rachel) And RossRoss is missing everything. So
Rachel| Yeah?
Joey| Maybe you two should live together.
Rachel| Are you asking me to move out? Do you not want me here?
Joey| Oh no-no, no-no I love living with you. It just seems thatif
youre gonna have a roommate, yknow it might as well be the father.
Rachel| But Joey, I dont think Ross wants me to move into his apartment
and disrupt his life like that. I mean(Ross turns to her with wishful eyes.)Or
he does.
Ross| No I-I-I would love to be around for you and the baby. And we-we can just
try it like on a temporary basis.
Rachel| But Ross, its you and me!
Ross| So? Sure! But it-it wouldnt be anything romantic. And
Im-Im dating MonaDamnit Mona! I was supposed to meet her like an hour
ago! What is wrong with me?!
Joey| All right now, so? What do you think?
Rachel| I dont know. Is it crazy?
Ross| No! No its not. Joey, this is a smart idea.
Joey| Well, I was due.
Rachel| Okay, lets do it. Ill move in.
Ross| Really?
Rachel| Yeah.
Ross| Oh Rach thats great. Thats great. (They hug and Joey breathes
a sigh of relief.)
[Scene| Monica and Chandler's, Chandler is pounding out the hinge pins on the closet
door to get it open.]
Chandler| Not to shabby, I got this all off myselfusing my wifes
tools. (He takes the door off the frame and we finally get to see whats behind the
green door! It is stacked, floor to ceiling, with junk.) Oh my God!
Monica| (entering) (Gasps) How did you get in there?!
Chandler| (laughs) Youre messy.
Monica| Oh no! You werent supposed to see this!
Chandler| I married Fred Sanford!
Monica| No Chandler, you dont understand! (Chandler starts singing the
theme for Sanford and Son, an old TV show starring Redd Fox.) Okay! Okay! Okay!
Fine! Now you know. Okay? Im yknowIm sick.
Chandler| No, honey youre not sick! Look, I dont love you because
youre organized, I love you in spite of that.
Monica| Really? You promise you wont tell anyone?
Chandler| Yes! And look, now that I know if I got some extra stuff lying around
can we, can we share the closet.
Monica| Wellits just ummIm afraid you might mess it up.
[Scene| Joey and Rachel's, Joey is drinking a gallon of orange juice as Chandler
enters.]
Chandler| Hey.
Joey| Hey.
Chandler| So Rachels all moved out huh? How are you taking it?
Joey| Well uh, I wanted to have a few beers, but uh, I got rid of those because
Rachel couldnt stand the smell of them. But I have thrown back a lot of orange juice
with calcium though. And uh, its a couple weeks past its expiration date, so
its got a bit of a kick.
Chandler| Are you okay?
Joey| Are you kidding me? Im great! Yeah, Im uh; Im better
than great. I am good. And now that shes gone, I can uh, I can do all this stuff
around here that I couldnt do before. Yknow? Like umm, I can walk around naked
again. Yknow? I can uh, I can watch porn in the living room. Right? This is uh, this
is good for me. Yknow? I like being on my own, Im uh, better off this way.
Im uh, a lone wolf. Yknow? A loner. Alone. All alone. Forever. Whats a
wolf got to do to get a huh around here?! (Chandler rushes over and hugs him.)
[Scene| Phoebe's Apartment, Phoebe is giving Monica another massage.]
Monica| Ohhh.
Phoebe| Thats it. Just relax.
Monica| Ohh. Oh! Ohh!
Phoebe| Come on more!
Monica| Oh God!
Phoebe| Yeah, you like that dont you?
Monica| Oh yeah right there!
Phoebe| You want it there? You take it there baby!
Monica| Uh Phoebe?
Phoebe| Yeah, say my name. Say it! (She stops when she realizes what shes
doing.) And now Im going to cover you back up, and umm were never doing this
again.

Ross| (closes the door) Did you umIm sorry, did you just say
its Rachel?
Joey| Yes.
Ross| Um, youyou like Rachel?
Joey| Yes. I like Rachel.
Ross| Rachel?!
Joey| (startled) Yeah, okay but look, buy uhHey-hey, yknow,
yknow who else I like? You! And it-it doesnt get said enough. I like you Ross.
Ross| But R-R-Rachel-Rachel?!
Joey| Yeah, but its not a big deal.
Ross| Its not a big deal? Oh, Im sorry I justum, Iwhat
about all the stuff you-you just said? I mean how about, I likeyou-you cant
stop thinking about her. Like how you cant sleep?
Joey| Im an actor, yknow? As-as a group, we tend to be over
dramatic.
Ross| Rachel whos carrying my baby? Rachel?
Joey| Look no, I-I know its bad, and I know its wrong. Okay? But-but
its not like anythings ever gonna happen. Yknow? These-these are just
feelings, theyre gonna go away.
Ross| Yknow what? I-I gotta go. (Starts to leave.)
Joey| Oh come on Ross! Hey Ross-Ross dont
Ross| (stops) I justyknowI-I just have oneRachel?!
Gunther| Rachel?!!
[Scene| Central Perk, Rachel and Chandler are on the couch.]
Rachel| Oh-oh! Okay, shes kicking!
Chandler| Oh! (Puts his hand on her belly.) Shes growing inside you.
Rachel| Whoa!!
Chandler| Oh! (Pulls his hand away.)
Rachel| Wow that was a big one.
Chandler| I think thats the youngest girl ever to reject me.
Phoebe| (entering) Oh hey you guys!
Chandler| Oh hey!
Rachel| Hi!
Phoebe| Hey listen let me ask you, do you believe in soul mates?
Rachel| Oh yes I do. I do. I believe that there is one perfect person out there
for everyone. And do you know how you find him? You stop looking for him. Thats why
I stopped looking for Russell Crowe. Hell find me.
Phoebe| Uh-huh, (To Chandler) and you?
Chandler| No. I mean I believe that uh, certain people are more suited for each
other and I believe in falling in love, but soul mates, I dont think they exist.
Phoebe| Okay, good.
Chandler| Why?
Phoebe| Well last night, I met Monicas.
Chandler| What?
Phoebe| Yeah, I had a date with this guy, and I swear to God, he is her other
half.
Chandler| Come on, dont be crazy. (To Rachel) You dont think
theres someone out there better suited for Monica than me, do ya? (Rachel looks at
him.)
Rachel| (To Phoebe) Well, whats he like?!
Phoebe| Well hes tall.
Rachel| Uh-huh.
Phoebe| He has brown hair.
Rachel| Of course, of course.
Chandler| A tall guy with hair similar to mine, oh unknowable universe!
Phoebe| He works with food!
Rachel| Oh sure. Older?
Phoebe| Obviously, and hes British.
Rachel| Oh, I was just gonna ask!
Phoebe| Yeah? And, hes-hes so centered and mature and confident.
Rachel| Oh, its so sad they never had a chance to meet.
Chandler| Luckily, the guy she settled for cant hear what youre
talking about.
Phoebe| Oh, Im so sorry. Um, and maybe Im wrong! I
butyknow Im gonna go out with him again, Ill find out more.
Chandler| You believe that this guy is destined for someone else and youre
still gonna date him?
Phoebe| Well, he may not be my soul mate, but a girls gotta eat.
[Scene| Ross and Rachel's, Ross is opening the door to Monica.]
Monica| Hey.
Ross| Hey.
Monica| I just talked to Joey, I justI want to see how you were.
Ross| Oh yknow, I stillI cant believe it. Joey and Rachel I
mean its Its like you and me going out, only weirder!
Monica| All right, I know youre hurting, and-and I want to be supportive,
but dont say that again.
Ross| Oh my God! What if, what if they get married? Then hed be the
stepfather of my child.
Monica| Honey, I dont think thats something we need to worry about!
First of all hes-hes never gonna tell her how he feels about her. And even if
he did you have no idea how shed react.
Ross| Sure, because women never like Joey. Yknow, I think hes a
virgin.
Monica| Joeyhes not even thinking about going after Rachel!
Ross| Hes not?
Monica| No! All hes thinking about is how youre taking this! I mean,
listen its totally freaking him out. Hes talking about moving to Vermont.
Ross| Why?
Monica| He says he wants to leave the country. (Pause) He thinks you hate him.
Ross| Hate him? I No, I dont hate him. (Pause) Its just
its Rachel, yknow?
Monica| Honey I cant even imagine how hard this must be for you. But, I
dont want you to lose Joey over it. And right now he just needs to know that
youre still his friend.
Ross| Okay. Okay, Ill talk to him.
Monica| All right. Now do it soon, he just asked me how to convert his dollars
into Vermont money.
[Scene| Central Perk, Monica and Chandler are on the couch as Phoebe enters with
Monicas soul mate.]
Phoebe| Oh! Hi!
Monica| Hi!
Phoebe| Umm, Chandler, Monica, this is Don.
Don| Oh, hello. (Shakes Chandlers hand.) Hello. (Shakes Monicas
hand.)
Phoebe| (mouths to Chandler) Soul mate.
Chandler| (mouths to Phoebe) What?
Phoebe| (cough talks) Soul mate.
Monica| So, what have you guys been doing?
Don| Well, we just had a terrible lunch today at Reattica. What is with all the
sun-dried tomatoes at that place?
Monica| I know! What is this, 1985?!
Don| Thats exactly what I said. Phoebe, isnt that strange.
Monica| Not really.
Chandler| Whats wrong with sun-dried tomatoes? (Everyone stares at him.)
On a barbecue chicken pizza? (Still theres staring.) No?
Monica| So Don, what-what other restaurants do you like?
Don| Well, Octavio, 27&7Oh! And theres this great little place,
Alessandros.
Monica| Oh my God! Thats my restaurant, Im the chef there.
Don| Youre kidding me!
Monica| No!
Don| Your food is fantastic! Wow, I really want to talk to you about your menu,
once I get some coffees first. Um, anyone want any?
Monica| Oh, Id like a latte. Oh yknow what? If youre gonna
talk about me, Im gonna go with you.
Chandler| What are you doing?!
Phoebe| Nothing! I swear to God I didnt know you guys would be here! And
the good news is you didnt believe in soul mates. So
Chandler| I believe in tall, handsome strangers who hit on my wife!
Phoebe| Theyre just talking, and yknow what? Just because I think
theyre soul mates doesnt mean anythings gonna happen.
Monica| (returning) Phoebe, good work.
Phoebe| Yeah?
Monica| Yeah! Oh hes great, I love him. (Walks away and Chandler glares at
Phoebe.)
Phoebe| Dont worry, well find you someone else.
[Scene| Joeys Apartment, theres a knock on the door and Joey answers it to
Ross.]
Joey| Hey.
Ross| Hey.
Joey| Look, I understand if you came by to hit me, I deserve it.
Ross| No, I dont want to hit you.
Joey| Oh what then? Kick me?
Ross| No.
Joey| (getting worried) Bite me?
Ross| No, no I dont want to do anything to you. All right? I just want to
tell you that Im not mad at you andand that I certainly do not hate you. I
just, I just came here to say that. (Starts to leave.)
Joey| Oh nowHey Ross-Ross! Do you wanna-wanna come in for a beer or
something?
Ross| Uhyeah sure. (Enters.)
Joey| Do uh, do you got any beer? All-all I got is this melon stuff that Rachel
left. I dont
Ross| Okay.
Joey| (pouring two glasses) Hey look Ross, you need to understand something
okay? I uhI am never gonna act on this Rachel thing, okay? I-I would never do
anything to jeopardize my friendship with you. (He hands Ross a glass.)
Ross| Thank you.
Joey| Anyway, it uhlook itll justtake me a while to get over
her, thats all. Im not even sure how to do that, I mean Ive never been
in love before so
Ross| What?! Youre in love with her.
Joey| Yeah, I thought you knew that.
Ross| Umm, no.
Joey| Wow. Hey look, if it helps, I dont want to feel this way. Honest. I
just keep thinking, "Ah, Ill get over this." Yknow? I justIt
just keeps gettin harder. I dont, I dont know what to do. Yknow?
What do I do?
Ross| I think you need to tell her how you feel.
Joey| Okay thats the green stuff talkin.
Ross| No, Im serious. You-you need to find out where she is, because if
shes not where you are, then you can start to move past this.
Joey| But what if uhand Im not saying she will beBut
Ross| If she is where you are then uhthen my feeling weird about it
shouldnt stand in the way.
Joey| Are you sure?
Ross| Yeah. Look if-if shes gonna end up with somebody else, the truth is
she couldnt find a better guy. So
Joey| Hey thanks.
Ross| So when do you think youre gonna talk to her?
Joey| Oh my God I have to tell her! I havent even thought about what I
will say. What should I say?
Ross| Im understanding, but lets not get carried away.
Joey| Im sorry, youre right. What am I gonna say? (He takes another
sip of the green stuff and recoils at the taste.) Oh!
Ross| Yeah, tell me about it. (He stands up, turns his back to Joey, and enjoys
another sip.)
[Scene| Central Perk, Phoebe and Chandler are watching Monica and Don talk.]
Don| so Ive been slowly phasing out the wine importing and focusing
more on the cheese side of things.
Chandler| Cheese you say? Thats some pretty smelly work, huh Don?
Don| Excuse me?
Chandler| Cheese, its smelly. You must smell a lot of the time too.
Don| Uh, not really. But when it comes to cheese, Im one of the people who
thinks the smellier the better.
Monica| Me too! Yeah, Chandler cant stand it. He wont even allow me
to have blue cheese in the house.
Don| And youre still married to him? (They both laugh, and Chandler tries
to but fails.)
Monica| You know what Id love to do? I would like to go to France and eat
nothing but bread and cheeseNot even bread, just cheese. No, I want the bread. Yeah.
Ah, and pastries (Breathlessly) And pate. Oh, Im really not high, its
just I used to be fat.
Don| Well if you where ever enter the Loire valley let me know, Ive got a
great little villa you can stay at.
Chandler| Is it made of cheese?
Don| No. But God, a house made of cheese, wouldnt that be incredible?!
Monica| Id move in tomorrow!
Chandler| (disgusted) Oh come on! (To Phoebe) Are you listening to this?
Phoebe| Im so sorry.
Chandler| What do we do?
Phoebe| I dont know, they both want to live in a house of cheese! I
dont know how you fight that.
[Scene| Outside Ross and Rachel's, Joey walks up to knock on the door, but stops.]
Joey| Okay. Okay, I can do this. I can tell her how I feel. Just uh, just stand
up straight. (Does so.) Take a couple deep breaths. (Does so.) Look confident. (Does so as
Rachel opens the door and startles him.)
Rachel| Joey? Whats up?
Joey| I uh, I just came by because I-I want to talk to you about something.
Rachel| Okay whats up?
Joey| Here? In the hall? What are we animals?
Rachel| Well honey, Im late for a meeting. So can you just make it quick?
Joey| Okay umm, I just came by to tell you that Iwant to have dinner with
you tonight. Thats all.
Rachel| Sure! That sounds great! Just leave me a message and tell me where to
meet you. Okay? (Walks away.)
Joey| Okay. Thats good. Okay, that give you a couple hours to prepare what
youre gonna say. Good. Yeah. (Someone comes out of his apartment and it startles
Joey again.) Dont you people ever knock?!
[Scene| Monica and Chandler's, Monica and Chandler are entering.]
Monica| Id like to have Don and Phoebe over. Wouldnt that be nice?
Chandler| Sure, why dont you set it up. Ill just be over here,
browsing through the personals.
Monica| Are you okay? Youve been acting weird all afternoon.
Chandler| Yeah, fine. Fine. Not perfect!! But good enough.
Monica| Jeez! What is with you?
Chandler| Im sorry, did you say cheese?
Monica| All right, whats going on?
Chandler| Phoebe thinks you and Don are soul mates, and I dont believe in
that kind of stuff. But then you two totally get along. So look, I wont stand in
your way if you want to run off with Don and live in a house of cheese.
Monica| Chandler, you dont believe in soul mates?
Chandler| No. But Im sure (mimics Don) tomatoes does.
Monica| I dont believe in soul mates either.
Chandler| You dont?
Monica| No. I dont think that you and I were destined to end up together.
I think that we fell in love and work hard at our relationship. Some days we work really
hard.
Chandler| So youyou dont want to live with Don in a cheese house?
Monica| No, Ive had second thoughts about that. Do you realize how hard
that would be to clean?
Chandler| I love you.
Monica| I know.
Chandler| Yknow what? I am going to take you out to dinner tonight. I
found this place that makes the greatest mozzarella sticks and jalepino poppers . (Monica
doesnt look impressed.) No? Really? They taste so good.
[Scene| A restaurant, Joey and Rachel are having dinner.]
Rachel| and I know Chandler is kidding but it happens every time he
touches my stomach. I mean Im really worried the babys not going to like him.
(Joey is staring at the table.) Are you okay?
Joey| What? Yeah! Sure! Uh, look at the uh, the reason(Exhales
slowly)Is it hot in here?
Rachel| No. Not-not for me, but why dont you take off your sweater?
Joey| I would, but this is a nice place and my T-shirt has a picture of Calvin
doing Hobbs.
Rachel| Oh my God! Really?! Can I see it?
Joey| Yeah. Sure. (They both half stand up, Joey pulls the neck of his sweater
out, and Rachel looks down it to see his T-shirt.)
Rachel| Huh. Wow, I wouldnt think Hobbs would like that so much.
Joey| Uh How long have we known each other?
Rachel| Um, sevene-e-eight, eight years. Wow.
Joey| Uh-huh, long time.
Rachel| Yeah.
Joey| But over the past few weeks
Waiter| Hah, sorry about the wait, but it is mega-jammed in here! We have a
couple specials tonight
Joey| Actually uh, could you give us a second?
Waiter| Sure. Sure. (Turns away, then turns back) Seconds up! (Joey glares
at him.) Notthat kind of table. (He walks away.)
Rachel| So you were saying?
Joey| Im not quite sure.
Rachel| Okay, well you had asked me how long we had known each other, and I
said, "Eight years." And the um, waiter came over and cut his tip in half, and
ummnow here we are.
Joey| Yeah, here we are. Uhh I I think Imfalling in love
with you.
Rachel| (stunned) What?
Joey| Im falling in love with you.
Rachel| (looking around) Who are you talking too? Oh, youre kidding! Oh,
its a joke! (Laughs.) Its funny. Its funny. I dont get it. (Joey
doesnt say any thing and Rachel realizes its not a joke.) Oh. (Pause) Okay.
Umm I-Iuh, wow. Are you uh How did umm When?
Joey| Does it really matter?
Rachel| Wow! Wow. Wow. Wow, it is hot in here.
Joey| Okay look Rach, I know this is a lot. You dont have to say anything.
You-you uh, you take as much time as you need. (Long pause as Rachel says nothing.) Okay,
you gotta say something!
Rachel| Joey, Joey I love you so much, but I
Joey| But. (Hangs his head down.)
Rachel| Joey.
Joey| Yeah-yeah right. Thats okay. Thats fine. Thats uh,
pretty much what I was expecting. So uh, its no big deal. All right? I think
Im gonna go. (Stands up.)
Rachel| No! Joey please! Please dont! Please dont leave like this!
Now come on, you cannot do this to a pregnant woman! (Starts to cry.)
Joey| Dont start doing that. You cant do that Rach, cause then
youre gonna make me do that. (Starts to cry.) Oh, here we go! (Sits down next to
her.)
Rachel| Can I? (Hug him.)
Joey| Sure!
Rachel| Oh Joey honey I dontI dont want to lose
Joey| Hey-hey-hey, hey! You cant. Okay? Ever!
Rachel| Im so sorry.
Joey| Oh no-no Rach, please, dont be sorry. Okay? Dont be sorry.
(They hug again.) Yknow I was only kidding you.
Rachel| Yeah, that was a real good one.
[Scene| A restaurant, Joey and Rachel are still hugging as a waiter walks by the table
to talk to the annoying waiter from before who is watching.]
Waiter No. 2| Is this your table?
Waiter| Yeah.
Waiter No. 2| God, youre gonna be here all night!
Waiter| I know! I havent even read them the specials yet!
Waiter No. 2| Whats the matter with them?
Waiter| I dont know. I think maybe one of them is dying. (Pause) I kinda
hope its the girl. (The other waiter is shocked.) The guy is really cute!

[Scene| The Hallway, Rachel walks up the stairs and knocks on Joeys door.]
Rachel| Joey? Are you in there?
Joey| (hearing Rachel and jumping up with his plate) Oh God! Thats Rachel!
Monica| Joey, you have to talk to her!
Joey| No-no, I cant! I cant! Not after the other night, its
just itstoo weird, okay? Dont tell her Im here! (Turns to run to
the bathroom and his bagel falls off the plate onto the floor.) Dont eat that! (Runs
to the bathroom as Rachel enters.)
Rachel| Hey!
Chandler| Hey!
Monica| Hey Rachel!
Rachel| Is Joey here?
Chandler| I dont see him. (To Monica) Do you see him?
Monica| I dont see him. Hey! Maybe hes in the sugar bowl! (Opens the
sugar bowl) Joey? Nope! (Closes the sugar bowl and they both laugh.)
Rachel| Well, at least you make each other laugh.
Monica| Whats up?
Rachel| Well, I havent seen him since that night that he told me how he
yknow I dont know, I think hes avoiding me. Why is that bagel on
the floor?
Monica| We were playing a game.
Rachel| Ew, was Chandler naked? Sort of like a, like a ring toss kind of
situation?
Monica| Sure.
Chandler| What?! No! No!
Rachel| All right. Well listen, if you see Joey will you just tell him
uhtell him I miss him. (Exits and Joey enters.)
Monica| (To Joey) Okay, did you hear that?
Joey| Yeah, a naked bagel game? (Picks up his dropped bagel.) (To Chandler)
Dude, I dont know. Thats a pretty small hole.
Monica| Honey, you gotta talk to her.
Joey| I cant! Yknow? You guys dont know what its like to
put yourself out there like that and just get shot down.
Chandler| (incredulous) I dont know what thats like?! Up until I was
25 I thought the only response to, "I love you," was, "Oh crap!"
Monica| Hello? No rejection? I got shot down at fat camp! Boy, kids are mean
when theyre hungry.
Joey| All right so, so what do I do?
Monica| This is Rachel. I mean, what are you gonna do, never going to talk to
her again? I mean I know its weird, its awkward, but you gotta at least try.
Joey| Yeah. Okay. (Goes to take a bite out of the previously mentioned bagel.)
Whoa! (Stops.) I almost forgot this was on your
Chandler| (interrupting him) We didnt play it!!
[Scene| Central Perk, Phoebe is holding a book as she, Rachel, and Monica drink some
tea as Chandler looks on.]
Phoebe| Okay, so when youre done with your tea Ill look at your
leaves and tell you your fortune.
Chandler| I didnt know you read tea leaves.
Phoebe| Oh yeah, Ive done it for years. I actually stopped because I was
so accurate. Yknow, and-and yknow, one of the great joys of life is
its-its wondrous unpredictability. Yknow? And also tea tends to give me
the trots.
Monica| Okay, Im done. Read mine.
Phoebe| Okay. (Looks at the leaves.) Ooh, I see a ladder. (Checks the book)
Which can mean either a promotion or a violent death.
Monica| (stunned) I-Im the head chef. I-I cant get promoted.
Phoebe| Uh-hmm. Uh-hmm, whos next?
Rachel| Okay, Im done. Do mine.
Phoebe| Okay. (Reads the leaves) Umm, oh! Okay, I see a circle.
Rachel| Ah.
Phoebe| Oh! (Checking the book) Which can either mean youre having a baby
or youre gonna make a scientific discovery!
Rachel| Well, I have been spending a lot of time in the lab.
Chandler| What does yours say Pheebs?
Phoebe| Umm Wow, all right. (Checks the book.) Wow! Yay! Ooh, Im
gonna meet a guy! And really soon! And hes gonna be the man of my dreams. Probably
not the guy I had a dream about last night. (Points at Chandler.)
Ross| (entering) Hey! Has anyone seen my shirt? Its a button down, like a,
like a faded salmon?
Monica| You mean your pink shirt?
Ross| Faded salmon color.
Monica| No, I-I havent seen your pink shirt.
Ross| Great! Great. Then I mustve left it at Monas. I knew it!
Chandler| Well, Im sure you get another one at Ann Taylors.
Ross| Thats my favorite shirt! Okay? I love that shirt!
Rachel| Well just ask Mona to give it back!
Ross| I dont know. I mean I-I guess I could. Its just that we
didnt really end things such good terms. And if I go over there Id be ignoring
the one thing she asked me to do when we broke up, jump up my own ass and die. (Walks
away.)
Phoebe| (noticing a guy sitting by the green post looking at her) Oh wait a
second you guysfor the last couple weeks Ive been that guy everywhere I go. We
take the same bus. We go to the same bookstore, the same dry cleaners; maybe hes the
tea guy. (He gets up to leave, and smiles at Phoebe.)
Chandler| Phoebe, did you see that?! He totally checked you out! He is so cute!
(Looking at his tea.) Mine has a picture of The Village People, what does that
mean?
Rachel| Hi!
Joey| Hey.
Rachel| Hi.
Joey| Hi.
Monica| Tea gives Phoebe the trots.
[Scene| Monica and Chandler's, Chandler is cooking as Rachel paces nervously.]
Rachel| So I thought Joey and I would be okay once we hung out, but its
not even like we know how to be with each other anymore.
Chandler| I know its tough now, but things will get better.
Rachel| How do you know that? What if it just gets worse and worse and worse, to
the point where we cant even be in the same room with each other?!
Chandler| Im not great at the advice, can I interest you in a sarcastic
comment? Some cheese?
Monica| Honey, what is the Bruce Springsteen CD in the Kat Stevens case?
Chandler| Lets just say if I cant find the right CD case I just put
it in the nearest one.
Monica| Okay, where is the Kat Stevens CD?
Chandler| In the James Taylor case.
Monica| Where is the James Taylor CD?
Chandler| Honey, Im gonna save you some time, 200 CDs, not one of them in
the right case.
Monica| Okay. No need to panic. Deep breathes everyone. Okay umm uh, were
just gonna have to spend some time and put the CDs in the right cases.
Chandler| Well, if were gonna do that we should come up with some kind of
order. Yknow alphabetically or by genre?
Monica| Hmm, I dont know. We really have to talk this through.
Rachel| Oh my God!! You guys have such problems!! I feel so terrible for you!
Monica| Okay, I-Im sorry. You and Joey, your both focusing on this
uncomfortable thing, what you need to do is to change the subject. Next time you see him
try to get him talking about something else.
Rachel| Oh yeah. That makes sense.
Monica| Yeah, like I dont know, maybe you have a work problem that you
need his advice on.
Rachel| Ooh, I can do that.
Monica| Good. (To Chandler) Uh honey, the Miami Vice soundtrack? Really?
Chandler| They were just giving those away at the store (off Monicas look)
in exchange for money.
Joey| (entering) Hey!
Rachel| Hi.
Monica| Uh I really dont know what to tell you Rach, I really dont.
I mean, maybe Joey can help you out with your, with your big work problem.
Rachel| What?
Monica| Yeah Joey shesRachels got this really big work
problem, and it is a head scratcher. Wow! (To Chandler) Yknow what, if were
gonna make dinner were gonna have to leave. Yeah. (She and Chandler exit.)
Joey| So you uh, have abig work problem?
Rachel| Yeah its umm Yeah its uh It-its
yknowIts nothing.
Joey| Huh. Okay. (Awkward silence.) So uh, I think Im gonna take off.
Rachel| YeahNo wait! Joey no wait it is. Its something.
Its-its ummits my boss.
Joey| Yeah?
Rachel| Yeah, and umm my baby.
Joey| Yeah?
Rachel| My boss wants to buy my baby!
Joey| What?! Oh my-oh my God!
Rachel| I know I told you, its a really big problem.
Joey| What he wants to buy your baby?!
Rachel| Can you believe that?!
Joey| Thats crazy!
Rachel| Thats what I told him!
Joey| Okay, how did this even happen?
Rachel| Well Ill tell ya! (Pause) See uh my-my boss and his
wifeThey-they cant have children. So umm, and thatwe were at the
Christmas party, and he got drunk, and he said to me, "Rachel, I want to buy your
baby."
Joey| Man! When you said it was a problem about your boss and the baby I figured
it was something about maternity leave.
Rachel| Ohh! Yeah! (Pause) Yeah that-that wouldve been a much simpler
problem.
[Scene| A newsstand, Phoebe is looking at a magazine as the guy from before walks by
and picks up a newspaper.]
Phoebe| Oh hello.
Guy| Oh, its you. I see you everywhere. Im Jim, Jim Nelson.
Phoebe| Oh Jim, Jim Nelson Im Phoebe, Phoebe Buffay. We certainly have
been seeing a lot of each other lately.
Jim| We have. Maybe well be seeing each other at dinner tomorrow night,
say around 8 oclock?
Phoebe| Well, maybe we will. (Starts to walk away.) Oh! (She turns around and
the exchange information.)
[Scene| Outside Monas Apartment, Ross is knocking on the door.]
Ross| Mona? (Theres no answer, so he starts to leave but remembers where
her extra key is. He reaches atop a hall light just outside her door and grabs the key. He
looks at in triumph as the pain from it being hot moves along his nervous system to his
brain, and when it arrives his brain orders his hand to drop the hot key and his mouth to
squeal in pain. After dropping the key he pulls his shirtsleeve over his hand and uses the
key to open the door and enter Monas apartment.) Okay, if I were a salmon shirt,
where would I be? (He hears a key in the door and as it opens he dives behind the couch.)
Mona| (entering, with her date) I am so sorry I spilled wine all over your
shirt.
Mona's Date| Oh, its okay.
Mona| No, its still wet. Yknow what? Let me get it out before it
sets. Ooh, I have something you can wear. Here. (Hands him Rosss shirt.)
Mona's Date| Oh umm, I-I dont know if I want to wear a womans shirt.
Mona| No-no thats a mans shirt.
Mona's Date| Its awfully pink. (Ross mouths, "Its
salmon!")
[Scene| Monica and Chandler's, Monica and Chandler are sorting their CDs.]
Chandler| Oh my God, honey we are so meant to be together. We both have copies
of the Annie soundtrack.
Monica| Honey, both yours.
Rachel| (entering) Hey! Great advice on that Joey thing!
Monica| Yeah? The work problem?
Rachel| Oh it was perfect! I mean it really felt like he was my friend again.
Chandler| What problem did you tell him you had?
Rachel| Oh thats not important. The point is, I reallyI think
everythings gonna be okay.
[Scene| Mr. Zelners Office, hes in a meeting as Joey bursts in.]
Mr. Zelner| May I help you?
Joey| Do you think you can just buy my friends baby?!
[Scene| A restaurant, Phoebe and Jim are on their date.]
Phoebe| Isnt it funny how we kept running into each other? Its as if
someone really wants us to be together.
Jim| Someone does. Me.
Phoebe| Oh, witty banter. Well done.
Jim| So, tell me a little bit about yourself.
Phoebe| Oh okay, well Im a masseuse, and I used to work at this
place
Jim| Do you like to party?
Phoebe| I-I-I like, I like parties.
Jim| Youre wild, arent ya?
Phoebe| Yeah I guess, a little.
Jim| It aint no thing, Im wild too.
Phoebe| (a little freaked out) So! Umm, anyway I-I lived in New York, someone
wildly I guess, for ummWell since I was fourteen.
Jim| Im sorry. Im staring. Its just that you have the most
beautiful eyes.
Phoebe| Oh stop it.
Jim| And your breasts! Hmm!!!
Phoebe| Okay. Umm look, youre coming on a little strong. But Im
going to give you the benefit of the doubt, because it seems the universe really wants to
be together. So, why dont we just start over okay? And you can just tell me about
yourself.
Jim| All right.
Phoebe| Okay.
Jim| I write erotic novels, for children.
Phoebe| What?!
Jim| Theyre wildly unpopular.
Phoebe| Oh my God!
Jim| Oh also, you might be interested to know that I have a Ph.D.
Phoebe| Wow! You do?
Jim| Yeah, (looks at his crotch) a Pretty Huge
Phoebe| All right. (Gets up and walks out.)
[Scene| Monica and Chandler's, Monica, Chandler, and now Rachel are organizing CDs.]
Chandler| (singing) The sunll come outtomorrow! Betyour
bottom dollar that tomorrow (The girls start laughing, and in a deep voice) therell
be sun.
Joey| (entering) Hey!
Rachel| Hey! Oh Joey, honey listen, thank you for talking to my yesterday about
that thing with my boss. That really meant a lot.
Joey| Not a problem. Oh, and just so you know, that guys not going to be
bothering you about that baby thing anymore.
Rachel| (worried) What?
Joey| Lets just say I took care of it.
Rachel| Whoa-whoa-whoa, lets say more!
Joey| Dont worry! Dont worry. I just told him, very nicely,
"You dont go buying peoples babies, so back off!!"
Rachel| What?!
Chandler and Monica|
Rachel| No! No, no-no-no Joey he doesnt want to buy my baby! I made that
up!
Joey| What?! Why?!
Rachel| So that we would have something to talk about! So it wouldnt be
awkward!
Joey| And you couldnt think of anything else?!
Monica| You said your boss wants to buy your baby?!
Rachel| (To Joey) I cant believe that you yelled at my boss!
Im-Im gonna lose my job! What am I going to do?!
Chandler| You can always sell your baby.
Rachel| Oh Joey, I cant believe you brought my boss into this! Im
gonna get fired!
Joey| You lied to me!
Rachel| Well, she told me too! (Points to Monica and Joey glares at her.)
Monica| Chandler has two copies of Annie!
[Scene| Monas Apartment, she and her date are making out as Ross flips through a
magazine while lying behind the couch and sees something that he likes. Meanwhile,
Monas date takes off Rosss shirt and Mona throws it on the floor. While they
start making out again, Ross tries to pull the rug the shirt is on over to him, but while
he does that he moves the coffee table and it bumps into the couch.]
Mona| (seeing Ross) Oh my God! Ross!!!
Ross| Hello!!
Mona| Ross, what are you doing?!
Ross| Not touching myself if that makes anyone less uncomfortable.
[Scene| Mr. Zelners Office, Rachel is knocking on the door.]
Rachel| Morning. You wanted to see me?
Mr. Zelner| Please, come in. Have a seat. (She does so.)
Rachel| Okay look Mr. Zelner
Mr. Zelner| Oh I think its best that I speak first.
Rachel| Yeah. (Motions for him to continue.)
Mr. Zelner| Ive asked Lee from human resources to be here as a witness to
our conversation.
Rachel| Oh God.
Mr. Zelner| If I in any way implied that I wanted to buy your babyI am
sorry. Okay? Last week when I asked you when your due date was uh, I certainly did not
mean that I felt that I was due your baby. Yeah, I want to be very clear that I
understand that its your baby, and it is not mine to purchase.
Rachel| Well, as long as we are clear about that. (Exits smugly.)
[Scene| A Street, Phoebe and Monica are walking down it.]
Phoebe| Oh there it is.
Monica| Thats not your regular dry cleaners.
Phoebe| I know, but that creep that I went on that date with goes to there so I
have to find a new one. I also have to find a new video store, a new bank, a new adult
bookstore, a new grocery store
Monica| What?!
Phoebe| A new grocery store. The universe said I was going to meet a nice guy
and thats what they gave me? (Looks up) When I get up there Im going to kick
some ass.
Monica| Dont worry Phoebe, youre gonna meet someone. If I can meet a
great guy, so can you.
Phoebe| Yeah, we both can. And we both will.
Phoebe| Oh, you didnt have to come in with me.
Monica| Are you kidding? This is where they get out stains! Okay? This is like Disneyland
for me. Im-Im gonna be over here watching the dance of the clean shirts. (She
points to and walks over to the electric clothes rack they have.)
Phoebe| Okay.
Guy| (To Phoebe) Oh, excuse me! I think you dropped s(looks at Phoebe.)
Wow!
Phoebe| What?
Guy| Im sorry, its just that youre so incredibly beautiful.
Phoebe| Oh yeah well, Im sorry about that too, but what are you going to
do?
Guy| I hope you dont think Im crazy but I feel like I was meant to
pick this up, do you believe in that kind of thing?
Phoebe| A little. (She turns around and looks up.) (To the universe) Now
youre talking.
Guy| Would you like to go out and have a cup of coffee?
Phoebe| I-I-Id love to. Let me just tell my friend.
Monica| (to the clerk) Ooh, an ink stain! Hey, can I watch how you get this out?
Phoebe| (looking around) She mustve left.
[Scene| Monica and Chandler's, Chandler is watching Joey pace nervously as Rachel
enters.]
Rachel| Hi.
Joey| So? What-what-what happened?
Rachel| Its all gonna be okay. Theyre just so happy that Im
not suing them that they gave me one extra month paid maternity leave. So long as I
understand that the money should not construed as a down payment on this or any other
child I should bear.
Chandler| Wow, Ralph Lauren is really going out of there way to show
theyre not in the baby buying business.
Rachel| Chandler, can you give us a minute?
Chandler| Oh Im sorry, youre kicking me out of my own living room?
Rachel| Yeah.
Chandler| Ill be in there. (Goes into the bedroom.)
Rachel| Joey, Im really sorry that I lied to you. I was just trying to
make things
Joey| I know. I know.
Rachel| It kinda worked. I mean yknow, I dont know about you buy I
havent thought about our thing since all this.
Joey| Hey youre right. Yeah, its kinda been like us again a little
bit.
Rachel| Yeah I know! I miss that.
Joey| Me too. I mean Ihavent thought at all about how I put myself
out there and said all that stuff and how you didnt feel the same way about me
and-and how it was really awkward.
Rachel| My gynecologist tried to kill me.
[Scene| Ross and Rachel's, Ross is ordering something over the phone from a catalog.]
Mona| (interrupting him) Listen Ross, you dont have to apologize. I
understand why you were there.
Ross| You do?
Mona| Yeah, you still have feelings for me. And-and to be honest, I-I still have
feelings for you. And I wish that we can work it out Ross, but we cant. Its
too complicated with you and Rachel and the baby, I-I just It just wasnt meant
to be.
Ross| (faking starting to cry) Oh God youre right.
Mona| Ross, wewe have to be strong. Okay, I-Im gonna go. (She picks
up the shirt Ross has just set down.) Can I? To remember you?
Ross| (laughs) No. (Takes the shirt back.)
[Scene| Central Perk, everyone is there.]
Phoebe| Oh, Ross, Mon, is it okay if I bring someone to your parents
anniversary party?
Monica| Yeah.
Ross| Sure. Yeah.
Joey| So, whos the guy?
Phoebe| Well, his name is Parker and I met him at the drycleaners.
Chandler| Oooh, did he put a little starch in your bloomers? (Sits up) Who said
that?
Phoebe| Yeah, hes really great though. He has this incredible zest for
life, and he treats me like a queen, except at night when he treats me like the naughty
girl I am.
Monica| (To Ross) Oh, by the way. Would it be okay if I gave the toast to mom
and dad this year?
Ross| Uh, yeah, you sure you want to after what happened at their 20th?
Monica| Yeah, Id really like to.
Ross| Okay, hopefully this time mom wont boo you.
Monica| Yes! Every year Ross makes the toast, and its always really
moving, and always makes them cry. Well this year Im going to make them cry.
Chandler| And you wonder why Ross is their favorite?
Monica| No! Really! Any time Ross makes a toast everyone cries, and hugs him,
and pats him on the back and they all come up to me and say, "God, your
brother." Know what theyll say this year? "God, you"
Joey| Well I can promise you, at least one person will be crying. (Points to
himself) Im an actor, and any actor worth himself can cry on cue. (snaps fingers)
Monica| Really you can do that?
Joey| Are you kidding me? Watch! (Makes funny faces trying to cry) Well I
cant do it with you guys watching me!
[Scene| Chandler and Monicas, theyre getting ready to leave for the party.]
Chandler| What are you doing?
Monica| Oh Im working on my toast for the party, or as I like to call it.
Sob fest 2002. Hey check this out. (Hands him a picture.)
Chandler| Its a dog.
Monica| Its a dead dog. Thats Chi-Chi; she died when I was in high
school.
Chandler| Its your parents anniversary and youre going to talk
about their dead pet?
Monica| The good stuff, huh?
Rachel| Hi!
Ross| Hey!
Joey| Hey!
Monica| You got a present for my parents. Thats so sweet.
Joey| Yeah, yeah, in honor of their 35th wedding anniversary, I had a
star named after them.
Ross| Aww that is so cool.
Joey| And I got them a book on Karma Sutra for the elderly.
Rachel| Hey, do you guys have any extra ribbon?
Chandler| Yeah, sure. What do you need? We got lace, satin, sateen, raffia,
gingham, felt, (Pause) and I think my testacles may be in here too.
Ross| (picking up Chi-Chis picture) Aww! Chi-Chi! Oh, I loved this dog!
Yknow Monica couldnt get braces because Chi-Chi needed knee surgery.
Monica| What?!
Ross| You were the 200-pound 11-year-old who rode her!
Phoebe| Hey!
All| Hi!
Phoebe| Everybody, this is Parker, Parker this is
Parker| No, no, no wait! Dont tell me. Let me guess. (Points as he says
their names) Joey, Monica, Ross, Rachel and, Im sorry Phoebe didnt mention
you. (Chandler makes a face) Chandler, Im kidding all ready youre my favorite!
Chandler| Ha!
Parker| Why dont all of you tell me a little about your self?
Ross| Ah, actually, Im sorry we-we probably should get going.
Parker| (laughs) Classic Ross. Rachel, Rachel, oh how you glow. May I? (Puts
hand on her stomach)
Rachel| I, uh, think you already are.
Parker| Rachel, you have life growing inside you. Is there anything in this
world more miraculous thanOh a picture of a dog! Whose is this?
Monica| Thats my old dog. He passed away years ago.
Parker| Oh well, at least you were lucky to have him. Bow-wow old friend,
bow-wow. So wheres the party?
Monica| Its out on the island. Its in Massapequa.
Ross| Well, there is an Arbys in the shape of a tee-pee.
Monica| Okay, I got my note cards. (To Chandler) Do you got the presents?
Chandler| Yeah.
Monica| And Ive got the car keys.
Parker| Were driving!?
Monica| Yeah.
Parker| Aces!
Ross| So uh, he seems like a nice guy.
Rachel| Yeah, yeah I like him a lot.
Ross| Ya wanna hang back and take our own cab?
Rachel| Yeah, otherwise Im not going.
[Scene| The Anniversary Party, Ross and Rachel are arriving and see his parents.]
Mr. and Mrs. Geller| Hi
Ross| Hi! (Kisses his mom.) Hey mom.
Rachel| This is such a great party! 35 years. Very impressive, do you guys have
any pearls of wisdom?
Mrs. Geller| Jack?
Mr. Geller| Why would you serve food on such a sharp stick? (Looking a
toothpick)
Ross| Thats a good question, dad. Thats a good question
Rachel| Hmmm.
Woman| (To Ross and Rachel) Congratulations you two!
Rachel| Thank youwere so excited
Woman| And also, congratulations on your wedding.
Ross| WhaWhat?
Mrs. Geller| Can we talk to you for just a yknow Its just a
little thing. Well we think its absolutely marvelous that youre having this
baby out of wedlock, some of our friends are less open-minded. Which is why weve
told them all that youre married.
Ross and Rachel| What?!
Mrs. Geller| Thanks for going along with this.
Ross| Dad so what we have to pretend that were married?
Mr. Geller| Son, I had to shave my ears for tonight. You can do this.
Ross| Can you believe that?
Rachel| Yeah, if youre going to do the ears, you might as well take a pass
at the nosal area.
Ross| No, us having to lie about being married.
Rachel| No, I know I dont either, but ya know what, its their party,
and its just one night. And we dont even have to lie; we just wont say
anything. If it comes up again, well justsmile. Well nod along.
Woman| Ross!
Man| Rachel!
Ross| Hi Aunt Lisa, Uncle Dan
Aunt Lisa| Congratulations on the baby, and on the wedding
Ross and Rachel| Hmmmm.
Uncle Dan| Heres a little something to get you started. (Hands them a
check)
Rachel| Oh
Aunt Lisa| So, hows married life treating you?
Rachel| (looking at the check) Unbelievable!
Ross| We love marriage!
Aunt Lisa| Great!
Ross| Hey
Phoebe| Hey!
Parker| What a beautiful place. What a great night! I have to tell you, being
here with all of you in Event Room CI feel so lucky. I think of all the good times
that have happened here. The birthdays, the proms, the mitzvahs both bar and bat, but none
of them will compare with tonight! My God, I dont want to forget this moment!
Its like I want to take a mental picture of you all! Click! (He takes a mental
picture of them all.)
Chandler| I dont think the flash went off.
Parker| Dahaaa! (Punches Chandler in the arm and he makes a face of pain.)
Im going to find the mens room, be right back.
Phoebe| Ill go with you
Parker| Come on!
Chandler| Somewhere there is someone with a tranquilizer gun and a huge
butterfly net looking for that man.
Joey| I have to go to the bathroom too, but I dont want him complimenting
my thing.
Ross| Im so we werent in the car! Did he ever let up?
Monica| He called the Long Island Expressway a concrete miracle.
Ross| (imitating Parker) This room! This night! That waiter! His shoes! I must
take a mental picture! (He backs into someone.) Ooh sorry(He looks behind him then
notices its Phoebe then stops his impression.)
Phoebe| Were you guys making fun of Parker?
Ross| That depends, how much did you hear?
Phoebe| So, he a little enthusiastic, whats wrong with that?
Monica| Its just that, its so much.
Phoebe| Well, so what I like him! Do I make fun of the people youve dated?
Tag, Janice, Mona? No, because friends dont do that. But, do you want my opinion? Do
you want it? Cause in my opinion, your collective dating record reads like the
whos who of human crap. (Walks off)
Monica| I feel terrible.
Joey| I know
Ross| What was wrong with Mona?
[Scene| The Anniversary Party, Ross and Rachel have just gotten another wedding
present.]
Rachel| Open it! Open it! Open it!
Ross| Yeah baby!
Man| So we never got to hear about your wedding!
Woman| We were surprise that we werent invited.
Ross| No, no, it was just our parents and 1 or 2 friends. It was a small
wedding.
Rachel| But it was beautiful. I mean it was small, but kind of spectacular.
Man| Where did you have it?
Rachel| On a cliff, in Barbados, at sunset, and Stevie Wonder sang Isnt
She Lovely as I walked down the aisle.
Woman| Really?
Rachel| Yeah, Stevies an old family friend. (Hits Rosss chest)
Woman| Oh my God. That sounds amazing. I would love to see pictures.
Rachel| So would I. You wouldnt think that Annie Liebawitz would forget to
put film in the camera.
Ross| Would you excuse us for a second? (Pulls Rachel off to the side)
Umm. what are you doing?
Rachel| What? Im not you. This may be the only wedding I ever have. I want
it to be amazing.
Ross| Okay, okay. Ooooh, ooh maybe I rode in on a Harley.
Rachel| Okay, Ross, it has to be realistic.
Parker| Are you okay? You seem kind of quiet.
Phoebe| No, Im fine. Im great. Im with you.
Parker| And Im with you! What a great time to be alive! Look at this
plate-bouncy thing. (Bounces the plates) What an inspired solution to mans plate
dispensing problems.
Phoebe| Hm huh, yeah.
Parker| Ah! Oysters! Let me feed you one.
Phoebe| No, thats not necessary.
Parker| Please.
Phoebe| No, actually I dont eat
Parker| I wont quit until you try.
Phoebe| Okay, fine! Fine! (Takes the oyster and pretends to eat it while
dropping it on the floor) Mmmhmmmmm.
Parker| What are they like? Ive never had one.
Phoebe| Why dont you just try one?
Parker| No, they look too weird.
Chandler| What are you doin?
Monica| Just going over my toast. Those two will never know what hit em. I
cant wait. Theyre going to be crying so hard. Theyre going to be
fighting for breath.
Chandler| Ya know if you want to, I can just hold them down and you could
(Punches the air).
Rachel| And my veil was lace, made by blind, Belgium nuns.
Woman| Blind?
Rachel| Well, not at first, but it was very intricate work and they said even
though they lost their sight, it was all worth it.
Aunt Lisa| Ill bet you looked beautiful
Rachel| Well, I dont know about that, but some said that I looked like a
floating angel.
Woman| (To Ross) So, how did you propose?
Rachel| Oh yeah. Thats a great story.
Ross| Well, um, actually, I-I took her to the planetarium.
Thats-thats where we had our first date. Um, she walked in and I had the room
filled with lilies, her favorite flower
Aunt Lisa| Oh that is so sweet!
Rachel| Shhh! I want to hear the rest!
Ross| Then, Fred Astaire singing The Way You Look Tonight came on the
sound system, and the lights came down. And I got down on one knee and written across the
dome in the stars were the words "Will you marry me?"
Rachel| And the ring, was the size of my fist (makes a fist)!
Joey| Yeah uh, Phoebe! Look umm, I want to apologize about before, okay? We were
being jerks. Parkers a nice guy and Id like to get to know him.
Phoebe| Then you better do it now.
Joey| Why?
Phoebe| Because Im going to kill him
Joey| What-what?
Phoebe| You guys were right. Hes just too excited abouteverything. I
mean Im all for living life, but this is the Gellers 35th
anniversary. Okay? Lets call a spade a spade this party stinks.
Joey| I know Im having the worst time. There was a 15-minute line for the
buffet, and when I finally got up to the plates, I slipped on a giant booger!
Phoebe| Are you sure it wasnt an oyster?
Joey| I guess it couldve been, I didnt really look at it.
Yknow, I just wiped it on Chandlers coat and got the hell out of there.
Phoebe| Hes just such a great guy Im so excited about him.
Joey| Oh hey, you should be excited about him. Theres nothing wrong with
him hes a good guy.
Phoebe| You think?
Joey| Yeah. Ya know what I think; I think we were all just being too negative.
Phoebe| Youre right. Youre right, hes just embracing life. We
could all stand to be a little more like Parker. You know what? I am like him! Im a
sunny, positive person.
Joey| Actually, you have a little bit of an edge.
Phoebe| Whats that now?
Joey| Nothing
Phoebe| Oh look its Parker!
Parker| Look! Its the bunny hop!
Phoebe| Oooh I love it!
Parker| You do?!
Phoebe| Are you kidding? People acting like animals to music. Come on!
Monica| Okay its time for the toast! Umm now-now, I know that Ross usually
gives the toast, but this year Im going to do it.
Monica| No, no its going to be great. Really! Mom, Dad, when I got
married, one of the things that made me sure I could do it was the amazing example the two
of you set for me. For that and so many other things I want to say thank you. I know I
probably dont say it enough, but I love you. (Pretends to cry hoping her parents
will join her.) When I look around this room, Im-Im saddened by the thought of
those who could not be here with us. Nana, my beloved grandmother who would so want to be
here, but she cant because shes dead. As is our dog Chi-Chi. I mean look how
cute she is. (Holds up the picture and pretends to cry again). Was. (To an old man by the
stage.) Do me a favor and pass this to my parents. Remember shes dead. Okay, her and
Nana, gone. Wow! Hey does anybody remember when Debra Winger had to say goodbye to her
children in Terms of Endearment? (Chandler covers his ears) Didnt see that?
No movie fans?! You want to hear something sad? The other day I was watching 60 Minutes
these orphans in Romania, who have been so neglected, they were incapable of love. (Waits
for people to cry, but doesnt get any tears.) You people are made of stone!
Heres to mom and dad! Whatever!
Mrs. Geller| Thank you Monica that was uh, interesting. Wasnt it
interesting, Jack?
Mr. Geller| (looking at the picture) Why dont I remember this dog?
Mrs. Geller| Ross, why dont you give us your toast now?
Ross| Oh, no, Mom, its just Monica this year.
Mrs. Geller| Youre not going to say anything? On our 35th
wedding anniversary
Ross| No, of course, Um Um, everybody? Um, I-I just wanted to sayon
behalf of my new bride, Rachel (She turns around and smiles), and myself. Umm, that
ifif in 35 years, were half as happy as you guys are, well count
ourselves the luckiest people in the world.
Mrs. Geller| (crying) Oh Ross
Mr. Geller| I just wish Nana were alive to hear Rosss toast.
[Scene| Phoebes apartment, Parker and her are entering.]
Parker| My God what a fantastically well lit hallway!
Phoebe| Can I get you something to drink? Like a water and Valium?
Parker| I must say this apartment, its, its, There are no words
Phoebe| Oh thank God.
Parker| Its a haven. A third-floor paradise. A modern-day Eden in the
midst
Phoebe| Yeah? I know! I know! Uh huh? Listen why dont we just um, sit and
relax? You know just be with each other. Quietly!
Parker| That sounds great. (Sits down) My God this is the most comfortable couch
Ive ever sat on in my entire life. (Bounces on couch)
Phoebe| Lets try something else, lets play a game.
Parker| I love games!
Phoebe| Shocking! Lets play the game of who can stay quiet the longest.
(Giggles)
Parker| OrJenga.
Phoebe| But, lets play this one first. And remember whoever talks first
loses!
Parker| I lose, now Jenga.
Phoebe| Oh my God! Oh my God!
Parker| Is something wrong?
Phoebe| Wrong? Really? You know the word wrong. Everything isnt perfect?
Everything isnt magical? Everything isnt a glow with the light of a million
fairies? They were just brake lights, Parker!
Parker| Well, excuse me for putting a good spin on a traffic jam!
Phoebe| You dont have to put a good spin on everything.
Parker| Im sorry thats who I am. Im a positive person.
Phoebe| No! I am a positive person. You are like Santa Clause on Prozac, at Disneyland,
getting laid!
Parker| So what do you want me to do, you want me to be more negative, less
happy?
Phoebe| Much less happy!
Parker| Fine! Well then to quote Ross, "Id better be going."
Phoebe| So long! Dont let the best door in the world hit you in the ass on
your way out! (He exits and she slams the door behind him.)
Parker| Isnt this the most incredible fight youve ever had in your
entire life?
Phoebe| Uh huh. (Closes door)
[Scene| Ross and Rachels, theyre returning from the party.]
Ross| and then, we couldve gone from the ceremony to the reception
with you in the sidecar!
Rachel| Ross, it just wouldnt have been feasible.
Ross| But having a dove place the ring on your finger wouldve been no
problem?
Rachel| It was really fun being married to you tonight.
Ross| Yeah! And! And, it was the easiest 400 bucks Ive ever made.
Rachel| Okay Ross, can I uh, can I ask you something?
Ross| Yeah.
Rachel| That proposal, at the planetarium
Ross| I know, I know it was stupid.
Rachel| Are you kidding?! With the, with the lilies, and-and the song, and the
stars! It wasreally wonderful! Did you just make that up?
Ross| No, actually I thought about it when, when we were going out. Its
how I imagined I uh, I would ask you to marry me.
Rachel| Well, that wouldve been very hard to say no too.
Ross| Its a good thing I didnt do it, because it sounds like it
wouldve been a very expensive wedding. (Rachel laughs) Okay, good night
Rachel| Goodnight
Ross| Even if the sidecar had a windscreen so your hair wouldnt get messed
up?
Rachel| I will think about it.
Ross| Thats all Im askin
[Scene| Central Perk, Ross and Monica are there.]
Monica| Okay thats it. I give up. At mom and dads 40th
anniversary, youre the one giving the speech.
Ross| Yknow I dont understand why they didnt cry. It was a
beautiful speech.
Monica| Oh, come on.
Ross| Hey! All that stuff you said about true love, you were right, I mean, we
did learn a lot from Mom and Dad! And that picture of Chi-Chi with her mischievous grin.
And what you said about Nana. Ohh, yeah she really wouldve wanted to be there. And
you know what? I think she was.
Monica| (starts to cry) Oh good God, Ross! How the hell do you do it?

carrying a magazine.]
Rachel| Hi!
Ross| Hey!
Monica| Hey!
Rachel| So, Im in my apartment doing the Soap Opera Digest
crossword puzzle, and guess who the clue is for three down. (She hands the magazine to
Joey.)
Joey| (reading) Three down, Days Of Our Lives star blank Tribbiani.
Thats me!! Im blank!!
Monica| How cool is this?! We know three down! Im touching three down!
(She has her hand on his shoulder.)
Joey| Yeah you are baby.
Monica| Three down knows Im married, whats three down doin?
Rachel| So did they call you to tell you your names gonna be in this?
Joey| No. They really like me over there. They want to do a big profile on me,
but I said no.
Ross| Whyd you say no?
Joey| Remember what happened the last time I did an interview for them? I said I
write a lot of my own lines, and then the writers got mad and made my character fall down
the elevator shaft. So who knows what I might say this time.
Chandler| If only there was something in your head to control the things
you say. (Joey nods his agreement.)
Rachel| Oh, come on Joey! You will totally keep it in check this time, and plus
yknow the publicity would be really good for your career! And you deserve that! And
if you do the interview you can mention, oh I dont know, gal pal Rachel Green?
Chandler| Is that gal pal spelled L-O-S-E-R?
Rachel| Okay, dont listen to him. Please?
Joey| Fine! All right, Ill do it. But hey! You guys have to be at the next
table so you can stop me if I yknow, start to say something stupid.
Ross| Just then or-or all the time, cause we-we have jobs yknow.
Rachel| Come on! We will be there for you the whole time! Just remember gal pal
Rachel Green. (Excited) Ha-ha! Im gonna be in Soap Opera Digest! And not just
in the dumb crossword puzzle. (Looks at Joey.) Seriously, proud of you.
Joey| Yeah.
[Scene| Central Perk, Joey is there for his interview and everyone but Phoebe are
hiding on the couch.]
The Interviewer| I really appreciate you taking the time to do this.
Joey| Oh, not at all. Happy to do it.
Monica| (To Chandler) You think were being obvious?
Chandler| No, were just four people with neck problems. You talk like
this. (Out of the sides of their mouths.)
The Interviewer| (To Joey) Yknow I think its great you wanted to meet
here. Yknow when most people hear the magazine is paying for it they want to go to a
big fancy restaurant.
Joey| (laughs) Actually, I didnt know the magazine was paying for it.
Wouldnt have mattered, Im doing this for the fans, not for the free food.
Gunther| Can I get you anything?
The Interviewer| Umm, Ill have a cup of coffee.
Joey| And Ill have all the muffins.
Phoebe| (entering) Hey!
Ross| Shhh! Were not talking.
Phoebe| Oh. Finally! Oh. (Sits back in relief.)
The Interviewer| So, according to your bio, youve done quite a bit of work
before Days of Our Lives. Anything youre particularly proud of?

The Interviewer| Like the candy?

The Interviewer| Oh, I know what I wanted to ask you. You were on the show years
ago and then they killed you off. What happened there?
Joey| It was so stupid, I said some stuff in an interview that I shouldnt
have said. But believe me, thats not gonna happen today.
The Interviewer| Understood. So, whatd you say back then?
Joey| Well, I said that I (The gang jumps up and interrupts him.)
[Scene| Central Perk, continued from earlier.]
Joey| You guys, this is Shelley, shes interviewing me for Soap Opera
Digest, and Shelley, this are my friends

recorder Shelley is using) gal pal Rachel Green.

Rachel| (scoffs at him) Yeah, thats gonna get you into Soap Opera
Digest. Well I(leans into the microphone again)I would just like to say
that Joey truly has enriched the days of our lives.
Phoebe| Umm, II just think you dont expect someone so hot to be so
sweet.

Ross| Your make-up!
[The next one is from Episode 712| The One Where Theyre Up All Night, Joey and

Joey| I think face to face.
Ross| I would say that.
Joey| Face to face, yeah!
Ross| Okay, here I go.
Joey| All right.
Joey| (grunting) Oh my How much do you weigh Ross?!

Woman| (to her friend) He has the most amazing Porsche under there!
Joey| Id love to show ya, but I just tucked her in. Shes sleeping.
(The women both laugh) Hey uh, would you two girls like to go for a drink? (Just then the
same guy with the football dives to make a catch, lands on the car cover, and collapses
it. It turns out that Joey set up a bunch of boxes to make it look like a Porsche.)
[The next one is from Episode 613| The One With Rachels Sister, Chandler has just

and your friend, I'm just y'know, I just don't feel that way about you.
Joey| Oh! I see what happened. It's because I was trying to repel you. Right?
Believe me, you'd feel a lot different if I turned it on.
Janine| I don't think so.
Joey| Oh, I do. (Gives her the Joey-love look.) How you doin?
Janine| I'm okay.
Joey| What?!?! Oh dear God!
Joey| Not much to tell there Im really shy.
The Interviewer| So, thats it. I guess thats all I need. Thank you
so much. I think they will be running this in the beginning of next month.
Joey| Oh great! Great! Thank you. (They shake hands.)
The Interviewer| Bye.
Joey| Bye-bye. (The interviewer leaves and he sits down with the rest of the
gang.) I did it!
Rachel| Yeah!
Ross| Amazing! Amazing!
The Interviewer| (returning) Oh wait! I almost forgot. We have to ask everybody
this. Other than Days of Our Lives, whats your favorite soap opera?
Joey| Oh, I dont watch soap operas. Excuse me, I have a life, yknow?
The Interviewer| Thank you. The readers at Soap Opera Digest will be
happy to hear that.
Joey| Oh, good to know. (The interviewer leaves.) So close!
[Scene| Monica and Chandler's, everyone is reading Joeys interview.]
Rachel| Wow! I cant believe they didnt put it in the part where you
said you didnt watch soap operas.
Joey| Yeah, I called the lady about that. I told her I was just joking. She was
pretty nice about that.
Monica| You slept with her didnt you?
Joey| Little bit, yeah.
Ross| Wow! This picture of you sure is steamy.

Phoebe| Hey!
Rachel| So whats the final head count on my baby shower?
Phoebe| About twenty, a couple people from work who had something else to do.
Monica| Also both of your sisters called and neither can make it.
Rachel| What?! You mean theyre not coming to a social event where
theres no men and theres no booze?! Thats shocking! I dont care,
as long as my moms here.
Monica| Oh my God, your mother!
Rachel| What?! My moms not gonna be here?!
Monica| Well, given that we forgot to invite her it would be an awfully big
coincidence if she was.
Rachel| My God!
Monica| Well it wasnt my fault, Phoebe was in charge of the invitations!
Phoebe| Well I dont, I dont have a mother so often I forget that
other people
Monica| (interrupting her) Oh give it a rest!
Rachel| So my mother is not coming to my baby shower?!
Phoebe| No. (Pause) Neither is mine.
Monica| Okay, yknow what? Dont worry, okay? Well take care of
it. Well call her. Just go home and get ready.
Rachel| Please, make sure she comes. Its really important to me, I mean
its my mom!
Phoebe| I know. I know, whats her number?
Rachel| I dont know.
Monica| Go! I have it in my book. Go! (Rachel leaves and Monica calls Mrs.
Green.) (To Phoebe) Wait a minute! If youre in charge of the invitations why am I
the one who has to call herHello Mrs. Green! Hi, its Monica Geller.
Mrs. Green| Oh, hello Monica.
Monica| (on phone) Hi, umm I know this is last minute, but weve decided to
throw an impromptu baby shower for Rachel today.
Mrs. Green| I know, my daughters told me about it when they received their
impromptu invitations a month ago.
Monica| Yeah, Im sorry. Im-Im so sorry.
Mrs. Green| For what dear? For not inviting me or lying about it?
Monica| (To Phoebe) Oh my God, my ass is sweating! (on phone) Please! Please!
Can you come? Its today at four.
Mrs. Green| Well all right. Ill see you at four.
Monica| Thank you. (Hangs up.)
Phoebe| Isnt it at three?
Monica| Son of a bitch! (Calls Mrs. Green again.)
[Scene| Joey's Apartment, Joey is reading a script as Ross and Chandler enter carrying
a basketball.]
Chandler| Hey Joe! You wanna shoot some hoops?

host of a new game show.
Ross| Oh cool!
Chandler| Thats great.
Joey| Yeah-yeah, and if I get it by day Ill (In a sexy voice) Dr. Drake
Remoray, but by night Ill be (In an announcers voice) Joey Trrrribbiani!
Chandler| Youll be perfect for this! Thats already your name!
Joey| But the auditions in a couple hours and I dont even understand
the game.
Ross| Well do you want some help?
Joey| Oh really? Thatd be great! You guys can be the contestants!
Ross| Awesome!
Chandler| Okay, I guess we can lose to junior high girls some other time.
Joey| (announcer voice) All right! Lets play Bamboozled!
Chandler| Bamboozled?
Joey| Yeah, isnt that a cool name?
Ross| (simultaneously with Chandler) Yeah!
Chandler| (simultaneously with Ross) No!
Joey| All right. Uhh, okay. Our first contestant is Ross Geller. Why dont
you tell us a little something about you Ross?
Ross| Well uh, I-Im a paleontologist. Umm, I-I live in New York. I have a
son Ben. Uh, hi Ben! (Waves.) And uh
Joey| I said a little bit Ross. Now, how about you Chandler?
Chandler| Well Joey, Im a headhunter. I hook up out of work Soviet
scientists with rogue third-world nations. Hi Rasputin! (Waves.)
Joey| Excellent! Lets play Bamboozled! Chandler, youll go first.
What is the capital of Columbia?
Chandler| Bogota.
Joey| Its Ba-go-ta, but close enough. Now, you can either pass your turn
to Ross or pick a Wicked Wango card.
Chandler| What does a Wicked Wango card do?
Joey| I should know that. Lets see, just one moment please. Umm, here we
are, a Wicked Wango card determines whether you go higher or lower.
Chandler| Higher or lower than what?
Joey| This is embarrassing. (Looks it up.)
Chandler| (To Ross) Can you believe how lame this is?
Ross| Im sorry, I dont believe contestants are allowed to talk to
each other.
[Scene| Monica and Chandler's, Rachels baby shower is underway. Monica and Phoebe
are working in the kitchen.]
Phoebe| Oh, I told the stripper to be here at five. Thats good right?
Monica| You ordered a stripper for the shower?! That is totally inappropriate!
Phoebe| What? Hes gonna be dressed as a baby! (Mrs. Green enters.) Oh hi
Mrs. Green!
Monica| Hi!
Phoebe| Im so glad you could make it.
Monica| Yes, thank you so much. And again, were so sorry. We could not
feel worse about it.
Mrs. Green| Try. Theres my little girl. (Goes over to Rachel.)
Monica| Shes still mad.
Phoebe| Yeah I know. Isnt it great? One less person we have to make small
talk with.
Monica| Phoebe, Sandras mad at you too. It-it doesnt bother you?
Phoebe| No look, weve apologized twice! I cant do anymore than that.
I know you hate it when people are mad at you but you just have to be okay with it.
Monica| Okay. I can do that. (Pause) I gotta go powder my ass.
Mrs. Green| Look at that face! Just like when you were in high school! If I
didnt know better Id say you were a cheerleader in trouble. Come on,
lets get some tea.
Rachel| Okay. (Mrs. Green helps her up and they walk over and get some tea.)
Mrs. Green| Oh my look at that. Only three weeks to go, now have you picked your
nanny yet? Now I dont want you to use your housekeeper cause it would just
split her focus.
Rachel| Oh well actually gonna use a nanny and uh, I dont even have a
housekeeper.
Mrs. Green| Its like youre a cave person. Rachel, you must get a
nanny. You dont know how overwhelming this is going to be. I mean when you were a
baby I had full time help, I had Mrs. Kay.
Rachel| Mrs. Kay! Oh yeah, she was sweet. She taught me Spanish. I actually
think I remember some of it, tu madre es loca. (I think thats your mothers
crazy.)
Mrs. Green| Such a sweet woman.
Rachel| Well, however great she was I just cant afford that.
Mrs. Green| Oh Rachel!
Rachel| What?
Mrs. Green| I just had the greatest idea! Im gonna come live with you!
Rachel| Wh-wh-what? What?
Mrs. Green| Oh, Im so happy Im gonna do this for my little girl. Aw,
look at you. You have tears in your eyes.
Rachel| Yes. Yes I do.
[Scene| Joey's Apartment, the guys are still playing Bamboozled.]
Joey| All right Ross youre in the lead, would you like to take another
question or spin the Wheel of Mayhem?
Ross| The wheel has not been my friend tonight Joey. Uh, Ill take another
question.
Joey| Okay, this is gonna be tough. Hold your breath.
Ross| Its okay, Im ready.
Joey| No dude, you gotta hold your breath until youre ready to answer the
question.
Chandler| This is ridiculous, hes not gonna hold his breath (Ross
cuts him off by taking a deep breath and holding it.)
Joey| Okay, what do you have a fear of if you suffer from this phobia,
TrisHoly cow, thats a big word. Trisc Seriously look at this thing.
Chandler, how do you say that?
Chandler| Let me see that.
Joey| This one right here. (Ross whines.)
Chandler| Triscadecaphobia.
Ross| (exhaling) The fear of Triscuts!
Joey| No! No, fear of the number 13.
Chandler| Fear of Triscuts?
Ross| Its possible, they have really sharp edges.
Joey| All right Chandler, youre up.
Ross| Wait a minute, I-I believe Im entitled to use my Angel Pass for a
free turn?
Chandler| This game makes no sense!
Ross| Yknow what? Youre just upset because youre losing.
Chandler| Oh come on Ross, I think were all losers here.
Joey| All right. Chandler, you can either spin the wheel or pick a Google card.
Chandler| Let me think. Let me thinkOh! I dont care.
Joey| You-you must choose Mr. Bing.
Chandler| Either, it makes no difference.
Joey| Choose, you jackass!
Chandler| Ill take a card.
Joey| Okay, you picked the Gimmie card! You get all of Rosss points!
Ross| What?!
Chandler| This game is kinda fun.
Ross| (To Chandler) You dont think its a little crazy that you get
all my points just cause you
Chandler| I dont think the contestants are supposed to speak to each
other.
[Scene| Monica and Chandler's, the baby shower is continuing as Rachel walks over to
Monica and Phoebe.]
Rachel| Why did you invite my mother?!
Monica| What?
Rachel| She wants to move in with me and Ross to help take care of the baby.
Phoebe| For how long?
Rachel| Eight weeks. I mean I love my mother, but my God, a long lunch with her
is taxing.
Monica| I personally would be honored if she wanted to live with me.
Phoebe| She cant hear you.
Rachel| What? You guys, come on! What am I going to do?
Phoebe| Well, if you dont want your mother to move in with you, just tell
her.
Rachel| Youre right. Youre right. I mean Im about to have a
baby, I can tell my mother that I dont want her to just be sleeping on my couch! Oh
my God! Shes gonna want to sleep in my bed with me. This cannot happen!
Monica| Thats right. That is right, you go over there and tell her you
dont want her to live with you. Do not take no for an answer!
Rachel| Okay. (She goes over to tell her mother.)
Monica| (To Phoebe) This is great! Now shes gonna be mad at Rachel!
Yknow what? And Im just gonna swoop in there and be like the daughter she
never had.
Phoebe| I have new respect for Chandler. All right everybody! Its time to
open the presents!
Monica| Yes! Yes! And I think that the first gift that Rachel opens
should be from the grandmother of the baby, because youre the most important person
in this room. And in the world!
Mrs. Green| Well uh, I dont have a gift because I wasnt invited
until the last minute, but thank you so much for bringing that to everyones
attention.
Phoebe| How about you less important people, lets open your presents!
Rachel| Mom thats okay that you didnt get you a gift!
Mrs. Green| Well, I kinda did. Me. Eight weeks of me.
Rachel| Oh yeah. Okay, see mom, the truth is I can do this on my own.
Mrs. Green| Sweetheart I know youre gonna be terrific mom, I just think
you need a little help, especially at the beginning.
Rachel| But mom, I really know what Im doing. I can handle this.
Mrs. Green| Really? Remember Twinkles?
Rachel| He was a hamster! I am not going to vacuum up my baby!
Phoebe| Okay, come on Rach its present time! Yknow youre the
glue thats holding this whole party together. Its kinda falling apart here.
Mrs. Green| Oh look.
Rachel| Wow!
Phoebe| Okay, this is from your friend at work.
Rachel| Oh my gosh! Oh wow! Oh, I know what this is! (Shes holding an item
with a large suction cup connected to a yellow plastic box, with a long narrow tube and
bottle connected the yellow part.) Wait a minute. That cant be right. Is that a beer
bong for a baby?
Mrs. Green| Darling, thats a breast pump!
Rachel| Did I say I was done guessing? Okay, thank you for that. Oh wow!
Whats this?
Woman| Its a diaper genie.
Rachel| Oh, it dispenses clean diapers!
Woman| No! Its where you put the dirty ones!
Rachel| Well thats gross, why dont you just take it outside and
throw it in a dumpster?
Mrs. Green| Oh youre gonna do that ten times a day?
Rachel| What?! It goes ten times a day! What are we feeding this baby?! Indian
food?!
Mrs. Green| No dear, thats what babies do.
Monica| Rachel, listen to your mother. She is very smart.
Mrs. Green| Plus, what are you planning on doing with the baby while youre
trotting out to the garbage ten times a day?
Rachel| I dont know, Id leave it on the changing table? (Everyone
gasps.) What?! Whatd I do? Whatd I do?!
Mrs. Green| You cant leave a baby alone!
Rachel| Oh come(Stutters)Of course I know that. I mean of course you
never leave a baby alone! I mean who wouldshe wouldnt be safe as she would be
with me, the baby dummy. Oh God, okay. Yknow what? I think opening the presents
right now is a little overwhelming right now. So I think umm, Im just gonna maybe
open them a little bit later, but thank you all for coming. And for these beautiful gifts,
and this basket is beautiful.
Woman| Its actually a bassinet.
Rachel| Okay mommy, dont ever leave me. (Hugs her.)
[Scene| Joey's Apartment, the guys are still playing the game only everyone is really
into it.]
Joey| (To Chandler) In what John Houston film would you hear this line,
"Badges? We dont need no stinkin badges!"
Chandler| Treasure of the Sierra Madre!
Joey| Correct! Theres a possible backwards bonus!
Chandler| Madre Sierra the of Treasure!
Joey| Yes!
Chandler| Id like to go up the ladder of chance to the golden mud hut
please.
Joey| Wise choice, how many rungs?
Chandler| Six!
Joey| (makes a sound like a monkey) That noise can only me one thing.
Chandler| (disappointed and simultaneously as Ross) Hungry monkey.
Ross| (excited and simultaneously as Chandler) Hungry monkey! (To Chandler)
Haaa! (To Joey) Id like a Wicked Wango card!
Joey| Okay, its an audio question, name this television theme song.
(Starts humming the theme to I Dream of Genie.)
Ross| (thinking) Oh. (Pause) Oh! Oh my God! Okay, I know this, give me-give me a
second!
Chandler| Tell it to the Time Turtle!
Ross| Shut up! I Dream of Genie!
Joey| Yes! Yes, youre back in the lead!
Ross| Id like to spin the wheel!
Chandler| (annoyed) Oh come on!!
Joey| All right! All right! Uh, umm, Super-Speedy Speed round!
Ross| Is there a hopping bonus?
Joey| Of course!
Joey| Who invented bifocals?
Ross| Ben Franklin.
Joey| Correct! Which monarch has ruled Great Britain the longest?
Ross| Queen Victoria.
Joey| Correct again! But, you forgot to switch legs between questions, so no
hopping bonus!
Ross| Noooo!!! Every time!!!
Joey| Now, over to Chandler.
Chandler| Id like a Google Card.
Joey| Are you sure?
Chandler| Yes! (Pause) No! (Pause) Google!
Joey| Oh my God! Congratulations Ross, because Chandler, youve been
Bamboozled!
Chandler| Nooo!!
Ross| Yeah!!
Chandler| This is the best game ever!!!
[Scene| Monica and Chandler's, the baby shower has ended and everyone except for Mrs.
Green have left who is talking to Rachel while Monica and Phoebe are cleaning up.]
Rachel| So umm, youre gonna stay with me as long as I need you?
Mrs. Green| Of course I am!
Rachel| Oh mom, I swear Im not an idiot. Ive read all kinds of books
on pregnancy and giving birth, but I-I just didnt think to read the part about what
to do when the baby comes. And-and then guess what? The babys coming and I
dont know what to do. Oh, can I throw up in my diaper genie?
Mrs. Green| No. Sweetie, youre gonna be fine. (Starts to get up.)
Rachel| Wait-wait where are you going? Where are you going?
Mrs. Green| Im going to the bathroom.
Rachel| Okay.
Mrs. Green| Now dont worry! Everythings gonna be okay. (Hugs Rachel
while she is standing and Rachel is sitting, seeing this Monica decides to join in on the
hugging by hugging Mrs. Green from behind her back.)
Monica| It is going to be okay! (Mrs. Green glances over her shoulder and
glares at Monica while she heads for the bathroom.) It was worth a shot.
Ross| (entering, out of breath) Hey!
Phoebe| Hey! Why are you all red and sweaty?
Ross| I just Bamboozled Chandler! (Flexes in victory while everyone stares at
him.) Which is not uh sexual thing. That was a quick shower.
Phoebe| Not if you were here.
Ross| Wow! It looks like we got a lot of good stuff.
Rachel| Oh we did, but my mom got us the greatest gift of all.
Ross| (excited) A Play-Dough Barber Shop?
Rachel| No. Shes going to live with us for eight weeks.
Ross| Uh, what?
Rachel| Yes! Shes gonna help us take care of the baby! Woo-hoo. (Sees that
Ross isnt happy.)
Ross| WhatYoure not serious. I mean shes a very nice woman,
but there is no way we can take eight weeks of her. Shell drive us totally crazy.
Mrs. Green| (entering from bathroom) Hi Ross!
Ross| Hi roomie! (Hugs her and looks at Rachel.)
[Scene| Joeys Audition, Joey is being shown in.]
Man| Hey Joey, hi! Im Ray; Im the producer of the show.
Joey| (announcer voice) Its a pleasure to meet you Ray.
Ray| And this is Duncan (points to the cameraman) and Erin, theyre gonna
help us out with the audition. So uh, lets get the camera rolling.
Joey| (announcer voice) Rightie-O Ray!
Ray| Whenever youre ready.
Joey| (to the camera) Hello, Im Joey Tribbiani! Lets play
Bamboozled! Erin, you get the first question! In hockey, who is known as The Great One?
Erin| Wayne Gretzky.
Joey| Correct! Now, would you like to pick a Wicked Wango card or spin the Wheel
of Mayhem?
Ray| Uh Joey, didnt your agents give you the revised rules? Weve
eliminated all of that. No wheel, no cards.
Joey| WhatWhy?!
Ray| Uh well, the game was too complicated and research showed people
didnt follow it.
Joey| Well whats complicated? You spin the Wheel of Mayhem to go up the
Ladder of Chance. You go past the Mud Hut through the Rainbow Ring to get to the Golden
Monkey; you yank his tail and boom! Youre in Paradise Pond!
Ray| Yeah all thats gone. Its basically just a simple question and
answer game now.
Joey| Well whats fun about that? You expect me to be the host of a boring
game thats just people standing around answering questions?
Ray| Well, therell be women in bikinis holding up the scores.
Joey| (announcer voice to the camera) Lets play Bamboozled!
[Scene| Monica and Chandler's, Mrs. Green is telling Ross what needs to be done to baby
proof his apartment.]
Mrs. Green| and all those dinosaur nick-knacks you have Ross, I thought
they might be more at home in the garage.
Ross| Well wewe dont have a garage.
Mrs. Green| Did I say garage? I meant garbage.
Ross| Yknow what? Maybe, Mrs. Green, its not absolutely vital that
you live with us.
Mrs. Green| Well Rachel needs help with the baby.
Rachel| I do. I really do. I dont know anything.
Ross| Im-Im sure thats not true.
Rachel| Oh no? Pheebs? Monica? Do I know anything about babies?
Phoebe| No, not a thing.
Monica| Its frightening.
Ross| Well uh, yknow what? Even if she doesnt know anything, I do! I
have a son. And his mother and I didnt live together, and whenever he was with me I
took care of him all the time, by myself.
Mrs. Green| Thats true. You do have another child.
Ross| Yeah.
Mrs. Green| With another woman. Have you no control Ross?
Ross| Thats a different issue. Uh, the point is, when the baby comes I
will be there toto feed her and bathe her and change her. And more than that I want
to do all those things.
Mrs. Green| Well then you really dont need me to live with you.
Ross| Yes! Yes, youre gonna be so missed.
Mrs. Green| Youre gonna be a great father.
Ross| Well youre gonna be a wonderful grandma. (They hug.)
Rachel| Hello?! I still dont know what the hell Im doing!
Ross| Oh, come on, every first time mother feels that way.
Youllyoure gonna pick it up. (Rachel doesnt believe that.) Hey!
You will! Uh look, yknow when you first came to the city? You were this spoiled
helpless little girl who-who still used daddys credit card. Do you remember?
Rachel| I hope youre going somewhere with this.
Ross| Look at you! WhatYoure-youre this big executive! You are
much more capable than you give yourself credit for. I-I have no doubt youre gonna
be an incredible mother.
Rachel| Really?
Ross| Im telling you.
Rachel| Thank you. (Hugs him.)
Mrs. Green| All right you two, Im gonna get going.
Ross| Oh. (Rachel and he start to stand up.)
Mrs. Green| Oh no-no-no-no sweetheart, you stay put. Ill let myself out.
Its like Im not here, which I almost wasnt.
Monica| (laughs) Youre still so funny. Youre so funny. (To Phoebe)
What do I do?
Phoebe| Nothing! You have apologized to her like a million times and shes
been nothing but terrible to you. And dont forget you just threw her daughter
a lovely, albeit slightly boring, shower, and she hasnt even thanked you for
it.
Monica| Yknow what? Youre-youre right.
Phoebe| Yeah I mean if you want to say anything to her, Id tell her off.
Monica| Really?
Phoebe| Uh-huh!
Monica| Okay! I will! Mrs. Green? Mrs. Green! (She ignores Monica and Monica
follows her out into the hall with Phoebe in tow.) It is rude to leave a party without
saying good-bye to the host! Yeah, and-and also when someone apologizes to you the decent
thing to do is to accept it! Now what I did to you, it wasnt on purpose! But what
youre during to me now is just plain spiteful!
Mrs. Green| Spiteful?!
Monica| Thats right! Maybe its time you took a good hard look at a
mirror young ladyold ladylady!
Phoebe| (To Monica) Wrap it up, wrap it up, wrap it up
Monica| So whenever youre ready to apologize to me, I will forgive you.
Good day! (Monica and Phoebe reenter the apartment and Monica closes the door on a stunned
Mrs. Green.) I cant feel my legs!
Phoebe| You were fantastic! Im so proud of you!
Monica| Yeah? Im proud of me too.
Phoebe| You should be!
Monica| Yeah could-could-could you get me something to drink?
Phoebe| You got it!
Monica| Okay. (When Phoebe turns around Monica runs out into the hall after Mrs.
Green.) Mrs. Green! Okay Im really sorry!! Im apologizing for the(She
trips and falls down the stairs.) (Pause) Okay, I bit my tongue, but Im still
really sorry!
[Scene| Ross and Rachel's, Ross is helping Rachel study for when the baby comes.]
Rachel| (closing a book) Okay! Im ready.
Ross| You sure?
Rachel| Yes, Ive done my studying and I really know my stuff.
Ross| All right then. (Gets up, in an announcers voice) Rachel Green!
Lets play Bamboozled! (Reading from a note card.) How do you test the temperature of
the babys bath water?
Rachel| Uh, put your elbow in it.
Ross| Excellent! How do you put a baby down for a nap?
Rachel| Full, dry, on its back, and no loose covers.
Ross| Thats correct! This is an audio question, what do you do when the
baby makes this sound? (Makes a sound like someone is choking a cat.)
Rachel| Check if its wet, check if its hungry, burp it!
Ross| Excellent! Excellent, now-now do you want another question or a Wicked
Wango card?
Rachel| A card! A card! I pick a card!
Ross| Oh, Im sorry youve been Bamboozled! Youre gonna be a
terrible mother! (Rachel stares at him agape.) Ive lost sight of why were
doing this! (Rachel gets up and walks away.)

[Scene| Central Perk, everyone is there except Monica as Ross enters carrying a huge
stack of newspapers.]
Ross| Hey you guys I got some bad news. (He sets the stack of papers down on the
table.)
Phoebe| Well thats no way to sell newspapers. Why dont you try,
"Extra! Extra! Read all about it!"
Ross| No, Monicas restaurant got a horrible review in the Post. (They all
gasp.) I didnt want her to see it, so I ran around the neighborhood and bought all
the copies I could find. (He hands the paper to Phoebe and they all read it.)
Joey| Man, this is bad! And Ive had my share of bad reviews. I still
remember my first good one though. (Quoting) "Everything else in this production of Our
Town was simply terrible. Joey Tribbiani was abysmal."
Monica| (entering) Hey!
Chandler| Hey.
Monica| (seeing the stack of newspapers) Oh my God! Look at all the newspapers!
It must be a good review! Is it great?!
Ross| Umm
Monica| (reading) Oh dear God!
Ross| But the good news is, no one in a two-block radius will ever know.
Monica| What about the rest of Manhattan?!
Ross| Yeah, they all know.
Monica| Oh my God, this is horrible!
Chandler| Im so sorry.
Monica| Im so humiliated!
Rachel| Yeah but yknow what they say Mon, "Theres no such thing
as bad press."
Monica| You dont think that umm, (reading) "The chefs Mahi Mahi
was awful awful," is bad press?
Rachel| I didnt write it.
Monica| Is he right? Am I reallyAm I awful?
All| No!
Joey| Yeah! Yeah Monica! You listen to me, okay? And Im not just saying
this because Im your friend, Im sayin it cause its the
truth. Youre food is abysmal!
[Scene| Ross and Rachel's, its late at night, Rachel is sitting on the couch in
the dark wide-awake as Ross walks to the bathroom.]
Rachel| Ross!
Ross| (startling him) What?! What?
Rachel| I am freaking out!
Ross| Are ya?
Rachel| My due date is in one week!
Ross| What are you doing up?
Rachel| That is seven days!
Ross| Okay look, I had a lot of water before I went to bed. Can we do this
after
Rachel| (interrupting him) No-no-no-no-no Ross! Please, come on we do not have
any of the big stuff we need! We do not a changing table! We do not have a crib! We do not
have a diaper service!
Ross| Its funny you should mention diapers.
Rachel| Im serious.
Ross| Okay look, theres nothing to worry about. We have plenty of time.
Theres a great baby furniture store on west 10th. Tomorrow, we will go
there and we will get you everything that you need. Okay?
Rachel| Okay. Thank you. Thats great. Thank you. Wait-wait! Where on west
10th? Because theres this really cute shoe store that has like this
little
Ross| (interrupting her) Okay. Okay. If uh, if youre gonna do this, then
Im gonna do that. (Points to the bathroom.) So (Starts for the bathroom.)
Rachel| (stopping him) Oh, wait Ross! Im sorry, one more thing!
Ross| (annoyed) Yeah!
Rachel| Umm, our situation. Yknow umm, what we mean to each other. And I
mean we-were having this baby together, and we live together. Isnt that,
isnt that weird?
Ross| (stunned) (thinks) Well uh
Rachel| Im just kidding! You can go pee! (He does so in a hurry.)
[Scene| Monica and Chandler's, Monica is cooking as Chandler looks on.
Joey| (entering) Hey uh Monica, I cant remember. Did we say we were gonna
meet here or at the movies?
Monica| We said at the movies, but
Joey| Okay, Ill see you there. (Starts to leave)
Monica| Joey! (He returns) Now that youre here
Joey| Sure, I can hang out til I have to meet ya. (To Chandler) What
uhHow come youre not going?
Chandler| I have a job interview I have to get ready for.
Joey| I thought you already have a job.
Chandler| And people say you dont pay attention. No, this is a much better
job. Its vice-president of a company that does data reconfiguration and statistical
factoring for other companies.
Joey| Wow! How do you know how to do that?!
Chandler| Thats what I do now.
Monica| Hey Joey, come taste this.
Joey| What is it?
Monica| Remember that guy that gave me a bad review? Well (Feeds him a
spoonful of what shes cooking.) Im getting my revenge!
Joey| You cooked him?
Chandler| The front page? You really do live in your own little world,
dont ya?
[Scene| The Baby Furniture Store, Ross and Rachel are checking out.]
Cashier| Do you uh, want these things delivered Mr. and Mrs. Geller?
Rachel| Oh.
Ross| Oh.
Rachel| No-no-no! No, no, no, were not married.
Ross| We are having a baby together, but were not involved. (The cashier,
a very beautiful woman, looks confused) I mean, uh we-we were seeing each other a while
ago, but then we were just friends. And then there was one drunken night. (Rachel looks at
him angrily) Or, yes stranger, wed like this delivered please.
Cashier| Why dont you fill out this address card. (Hands him one.)
Ross| Oh, okay.
Cashier| I notice you picked out a lot of our dinosaur items.
Rachel| Oh yeah! Actually, thats one of the reasons why were not a
couple.
Ross| I chose those, Im a paleontologist.
Cashier| Really?! That is so cool!
Rachel| Oh. Oh yeah, dont get to worked up over it. I mean it-it sounds
like hes a doctor, but hes not.
Cashier| Oh no-no, Im fascinated by paleontology. Have you read the new
Walter Alvarez book?
Ross| Yeah! I-I teach it in my class.
Rachel| Oh my God! Im standing at a cash register, holding a credit card,
and Im bored.
Cashier| (looking at the completed address card) Oh, I love your neighborhood.
Theres a great gym right around the corner from your building.
Ross| Thats my gym.
Cashier| I can tell you work out. (Ross is please and Rachel looks at him
confused.) A paleontologist who works out, youre like Indiana Jones. (Rachel has a
disbelieving look on her face.)
Ross| I am like Indiana Jones.
[Scene| Central Perk, Phoebe is there as Rachel enters.]
Rachel| Hi Pheebs!
Phoebe| Hey! Oh, how did baby shopping go?
Rachel| Oh, it was great! We got everything that we needed! Oh and Ross, almost
got something that wasnt on the list. A whore.
Phoebe| What?!
Rachel| Well, we were paying for our stuff and this saleswoman just started
flirting with him.
Phoebe| Well did she know you two werent married?
Rachel| Yeah.
Phoebe| Oh my God! Well the idea of a woman flirting with a-with a single man,
we-we must alert the church elders!
Rachel| You dont understand! You didnt see how brazen she was.
Phoebe| Sounds like youre a little jealous.
Rachel| No! Im not! I-I-I just think its wrong! Its-its
that ImHere I am about to pop and hes out picking up some shop girl at
Sluts R Us!
Phoebe| Is that a real place? (Rachels stunned) Are they hiring?
Chandler| (entering) Hey Phoebe! (To Rachel) Fatty!
Phoebe| Hey Chandler, why so fancy?
Chandler| Well, I got a job interview. Its kinda a big deal too. Its a lot
more money and Id be doing data reconfiguration and statistical factoring.
Phoebe| Wait, I think I know someone who does that.
Chandler| Me! I do that. So Seriously, do I look okay? Im little
nervous.
Rachel| Oh yeah! You reallyYou look great.
Phoebe| Yeah, just dont get your hopes up.
Chandler| Why not?
Phoebe| Well, the interview
Chandler| What about it?
Phoebe| Yknow! You dont make a very good first impression.
Chandler| (shocked) What?!
Phoebe| Oh you dont know.
Chandler| Are you serious?!
Phoebe| Yes, when I first met you, you were like, "Blah, blah, blah."
I was like, shhh!
Chandler| What is it that I do?
Phoebe| Well its just like youre trying too hard. Always making
jokes, yknow, you justYou come off a little needy.
Chandler| (To Rachel) Did you like me when we first met?
Rachel| Chandler, Im not gonna lie to ya, but I am gonna run away from
you. (Gets up and hurries out.)
[Scene| The New School, Monica, carrying her dish, and Joey are confronting the food
critic.]
Monica| Hi! Umm, Im Monica Geller, Im the chef at Alessandros.
The Food Critic| Still?
Monica| I think the things that you said about me are really unfair, and I would
like for you to give my bouillabaisse another chance.
The Food Critic| I dont see any reason why I would do that to myself
again.
Joey| Either eat it, or be in it.
Monica| Spoon? (Hands him one and he tastes it.) So, what do you think?
The Food Critic| Im torn, between my integrity and my desire to avoid a
beating. But I must be honest, your soap is abysmal. (Throws down the spoon and walks
out.)
Joey| Thata girl! Huh? We should get out of here; theres a new class
comin in.
The Cooking Teacher| Welcome to introduction to cooking. Now, before we start,
can anyone tell me the difference between a hollandaise sauce and a bearnaise sauce? (No
one can.)
Monica| I can.
The Cooking Teacher| Okay, go ahead.
Monica| Well umm, they both have a egg yolk and butter base, but a bearnaise has
shallots, shirvel, and most importantly tarragon.
The Cooking Teacher| Thats very good, whats your name?
Monica| Monica.
The Cooking Teacher| Monica, you go to the head of the class.
Monica| Okay. (Does so.)
[Scene| Ross and Rachel's, Ross and Rachel are unpacking and setting up their new
purchases.]
Rachel| All this stuff takes up a lot of room. Hey how uh, how serious are you
about keeping Ben in your life?
Ross| My son? Pretty serious. (Theres a knock on the door and Ross answers
it.) Oh hey Katie! (The cashier from before) What uh, what are you doing here?
Katie| Well, the delivery went out to you and I realized they forgot this. (A
blanket.)
Ross| Ah, mustve been fairly obvious since it was the only thing left in
your store.
Katie| Listen, to be honest, home deliveries are really a part of my job
description.
Ross| Oh. (Reaches into his pocket for some money as Rachel enters the living
room and watches holding two stuffed dinosaurs.)
Katie| Oh uhI actually came here to ask you out.
Ross| Oh! Wow! Uh, yeah! That sounds great. Im just gonna put this (The
money) back in my pocket, pretend that didnt happen. Uh yeah, actually
Im free now. Do you wanna grab some coffee or
Katie| Sure!
Rachel| Horny bitch. (They both look at her, pretending that the dinosaurs
shes holding are arguing.) No! Youre a horny bitch! Noooo! Youre the
horny bitch! No! Youre a horny bitch!
[Scene| Ross and Rachel's, continued from before.]
Rachel| So you guys go, have a really good time.
Ross| (To Katie) Yeah, Im just gonna grab my coat. And uh, and my whip.
(Katie looks worried.) Yknow because of the Indiana Jones? (Katie laughs) Not-not
because Im-Im into S&M. (Katies worried again.) Im
not-Im not into anything weird. Yknow? Just-just normal sex. (Katie is
uncomfortable.) So, Im gonna grab my coat. (Does so, leaving Katie and Rachel
alone.)
Rachel| So, you had a good day huh? Big commission; picked up a daddy.
Katie| Are you okay with this?
Rachel| Oh yeah! Yeah please, you guys have fun.
Katie| Okay. It was nice to see you.
Rachel| Oh and it was great to see you too. And you look fantastic, although you
missed a button.
Katie| Oh umm, actually I umm
Rachel| Oh okay, I see what youre doing there.
[Scene| Monica and Chandler's, Chandler and Phoebe are entering.]
Chandler| I cant even believe this! I really come off that badly?
Phoebe| Oh! Its okay, you calm down after a while and then people can see
how really sweet and wonderful you really are.
Chandler| Oh good. Good, because Im sure this interview is gonna last a
couple of weeks.
Phoebe| All right, dont freak out! Okay? I-I will help you. How
long before you have to leave?
Chandler| An hour.
Phoebe| I cant help you.
Chandler| Phoebe!
Phoebe| All right, all right, well just do our best. Okay? So lets
say Im the interviewer and Im meeting you for the first time. Okay. "Hi!
Come on in, Im uh, Regina Philange."
Chandler| Chandler Bing.
Phoebe| Bing, what an unusual name.
Chandler| Well you should meet my uncle, Bada. (Pause) Ill let myself out.
[Scene| The Cooking Class, Joey is trying to cook as the teacher walks over to him.]
Joey| Hi.
The Cooking Teacher| Your Fettuccini Alfredo looks a little dry, did you use all
your cheese?
Joey| When you say used, do you mean eat as a pre-cooking snack?
The Cooking Teacher| And the cream?
Joey| Cheese makes me thirsty.
The Cooking Teacher| Okay. Lets move on.
Joey| All right.
The Cooking Teacher| (To Monica) Oh! Something smells good over at Monicas
station! (She tries Monicas fettuccini.) Oh my God! This is absolutely amazing!
Youve never made this before?
Monica| Oh no! I dont know anything about cooking. I had to ask someone
what its called when the, when the water makes those little bubbles.
The Cooking Teacher| Well, hats off to the chef.
Monica| I-I-Im sorry, your-your mouth was full, I didnt hear what
you said. Umm, hats off to who now?
The Cooking Teacher| The chef!
Monica| Thats right.
[Scene| Monica and Chandler's, Chandler and Phoebe are still working on his
interviewing techniques.]
Chandler| I think youll find if I come to work here, I dont
micro-manage. I dont shy away from delegating.
Phoebe| Um-hmm, thats good to know. But lets stop focusing on what
you dont do, and start focusing on what you do do.
Chandler| (suppressing a smile) What I do dois manage to uh, create an
atmosphere of support for the people working with me.
Phoebe| I see. Nice sidestep on the do do thing by the way.
Chandler| Hardest thing Ive ever done in my life.
Phoebe| You gotta go!
Chandler| Oh! (Stands up.)
Phoebe| Okay, dont worry. Youre ready.
Chandler| Really?
Phoebe| Absolutely! Just fight all your natural instincts and youll be
great.
Chandler| Okay.
[Scene| The Cooking Class, everyone has finished baking a batch of cookies and the
teacher is going around tasting them.]
The Cooking Teacher| Ah Monica, my star student.
Monica| Yknow, you called me that before so I-I took the liberty of
fashioning a star out of aluminum foil. Now, no pressure, you like my cookies, you give me
the star. (Hands it to her.)
The Cooking Teacher| (tasting the cookie and with her mouthful) Oh, yum-yum-yum.
(Hands the star back.)
Monica| Wow! A star! (The class glares at her.) I know you all hate me and-and
Im sorry, but I dont care.
The Cooking Teacher| Okay Joey, youre up next. (Tries one of his cookies.)
This are good! This is amazing! You get an A!
Joey| I can an A? In-in school? (To Joey) Hey, Im a dork.
Monica| Joey! Im so proud of you!
The Cooking Teacher| I think you should give him your star.
Monica| Excuse me? He doesnt even know what hes doing!
The Cooking Teacher| Were all beginners here. Nobody knows what
theyre doing.
Monica| I do! Im a professional chef! (The class gasps.) Oh relax!
Its not a courtroom drama!
The Cooking Teacher| If youre a professional chef, what are you doing
taking Introduction to Cooking?
Joey| Yeah!
Monica| Im-Im sorry, its just that umm Well I-I cook at
this restaurant, Alessandros, and umm I just got a really bad review
The Cooking Teacher| Oh Alessandros! I love that place!
Monica| You do?
The Cooking Teacher| Oh yes! Youre an excellent chef! As a person
youre a little
Monica| Oh, Im totally crazy, but you-you like the food?
The Cooking Teacher| Very much.
Monica| Okay then, I dont stink. Im a good chef. Okay. (Starts to
leave.)
Joey| Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa! I dont want to go. Im having fun.
The Cooking Teacher| Well actually, did either of you pay for this class?
Joey| Hey-hey-hey, if my friend says its time to go, its time to go.
(Starts to leave, but comes back for his cookies.)
[Scene| An Office Building, Chandler is on his interview.]
Chandler| also I was the point person on my companys transition from
the KL-5 to GR-6 system.
The Interviewer| You mustve had your hands full.
Chandler| That I did. That I did.
The Interviewer| So lets talk a little bit about your duties.
Chandler| (nervous) My duties? (Trying not to crack a joke) All right.
The Interviewer| Now youll be heading a whole division, so youll
have a lot of duties.
Chandler| (trying not to laugh) I see.
The Interviewer| But therell be perhaps 30 people under you so you can
dump a certain amount on them.
Chandler| (really try not to laugh) Good to know.
The Interviewer| We can go into detail
Chandler| No dont I beg of you!
The Interviewer| All right then, well have a definite answer for you on
Monday, but I think I can say with some confidence, youll fit in well here.
Chandler| (relieved) Really?!
The Interviewer| Absolutely. (They walk to the door.) You can relax; you did
great.
Chandler| Yeah I gotta say thank you, I was really nervous. Yknow
Ive been told I come on to strong, make to many jokes, and then it was really hard
to sidestep that duty thing. (The interviewer doesnt understand) Duties. (Still
doesnt.) Duties! (Still doesnt.) Poo. (Still doesnt.)
The Interviewer| Poo?
Chandler| Oh my God this doesnt count! Okay? The interview was over, that
was the real Chandler Bing in there, this is just some crazy guy out in the hall! Call
security! Theres a crazy guy out in the hall!
The Interviewer| Poo?!
Chandler| Ill look forward to your call. (Walks away.)
[Scene| Ross and Rachel's, Ross is returning from his date.]
Ross| Hey.
Rachel| Hi! Youre back from your date!
Ross| How are you?
Rachel| Im fine, but thats not important. Whats important is
how was she?
Ross| Uhh, it was fun. We, we just had coffee.
Rachel| Oh uh-huh, uh-huh, coffee, a little rub-rub-rub under the table.
Ross| Whats uh, whats going on? Do you not, do you not like Katie?
Rachel| No! No, shesShe was nice. I mean, shes a little
slutty, but who isnt?
Ross| I liked her.
Rachel| Of course you did Ross, you would date a gorilla if it called you
Indiana Jones!
Ross| Did you get like a fresh batch of pregnancy hormones today?!
Rachel| No! Its just that, Kate bothered me.
Ross| Why? What was wrong with her?
Rachel| There was nothing wrong with her! All right? She was perfectly lovely!
Ross| Okay, so whats the matter?
Rachel| I dont want you to date her!
Ross| (laughs) Why? What, what are you jealous?
Rachel| Yes! And not because I want you to go out with me, but because I
dont want you to go out with anybody! Okay? I know its a terrible thing to
even think this, and its completely inappropriate, but I want you to be at my
constant beck and call 24 hours a day! Im very sorry, but that is just the way that
I feel.
Ross| Okay.
Rachel| What?!
Ross| I wont date. Ill uh, Ill be here, with you, all the
time.
Rachel| Really? But Im being so unreasonable.
Ross| True, but youre allowed to be unreasonable. Youre having our
baby.
Rachel| (starting to cry) Oh Ross, thank you. Thank you. (They hug.)
Ross| Do you feel better?
Rachel| No, not really. Youre pressing the baby into my bladder and now I
have to pee. Sorry. (She gets up and starts for the bathroom.)
Ross| Uh Rach?
Rachel| Yeah. (Stops and starts doing the I-have-to-go-to-the-bathroom dance.)
Ross| Just one thing umm
Rachel| Uh-huh.
Ross| We live together. Youre having our baby. Im not gonna see
anybody else. Are you-are you sure you dont want something more?
Rachel| (pause) Wow! I dont know, maybe. Im
Ross| Oh-oh, Rach! I was just messin around! (Shes stunned) Like you
did last night when I had to pee?
Rachel| (laughs) I knew that! I knew that! I was just messin with you too!
Ross| (pause) Okay. Okay. Because for a minute you said you
Rachel| Oh no-no-no-no, no!
Ross| that you actually
Rachel| No thats just(Laughs)Thats just cause
Im such a good messer!
Ross| Rach?
Rachel| Yeah?
Ross| The bathroom?
Rachel| Right! (Heads for the bathroom.)
[Scene| The New School, Joey and Monica are walking down a hallway.]
Joey| Well I had a great time! Learned how to bake, ate great food, thats
the first A Ive gotten since seventh grade, and I didnt have to sleep
with the teacher this time.
Monica| Oh, look! Acting for Beginners! Want to feel good about yourself?
Joey| What the hell!
Monica| Okay.
The Acting Teacher| All right, lets start with some basics. Can anybody
tell me what the difference between upstage and downstage is?
Joey| Yeah, this was a stupid idea. (Exits.)
[Scene| Central Perk, Joey is showing everyone a poster as Ross enters.]
Ross| Hey! What are you guys looking at?
Joey| Oh, its a poster for that World War I movie that Im in, check
it out.
Ross| Yeah? Wow! It looks really violent!
Joey| Uh-huh! I know. Im coming soon to a theater near you! Im in
THX! Im unsuitable for children!
Ross| Now I cannot wait to see this.
Joey| Yeah, yeah, its already generating Oscar buzz.
Phoebe| I started that!
Joey| I thought I did! Oh hey guess what? The premiere is next week and
youre all invited! (They all gasp.)
Monica| Are we gonna take a limo?
Joey| Sure! Why not?!
Monica| Oh I love taking limos when nobody died!
Rachel| Well obviously I wont be able to come, for those of you who
havent checked their calendars today is my due date. Well yknow, I just want
to take a moment and thank you guys for how great youve been during this time. I
really couldnt have done it without you. And I have loved these last nine
months! And even though I am so looking forward to the next part, I am really gonna miss
being pregnant.
[Scene| Central Perk, time lapse, and Rachel is entering still pregnant.]
Rachel| Thats right, still no baby! (To Monica, Joey, and Chandler on the
couch) Come on people! Please make some room!
Ross| Uh sweetie, maybe youd be more comfortable here? (Gets up from the
green armchair.)
Rachel| You. Like you havent done enough.
Ross| Look, I-I know how miserable you are, I wish there was something I can do.
I mean I wish I were a seahorse. (She glares at him) Because with seahorses its the
male, they carry the babies. And then also umm, Id be far away in the sea. (He sits
back down.)
Rachel| God. (Sits down.) I have never been so uncomfortable in my entire life!
Phoebe| Oh I know, Ive been there. I remember toward the end
Rachel| (interrupting her) Oh Phoebe, thats a great story. Can you tell it
to me when youre getting me some iced tea? (Phoebe gets up and Rachel groans.) (To
the baby) Oh God, get out! Get out!! Get out!! Get out!!
Chandler| Lets. (Everyone gets up and leaves Rachel.)
[Scene| Monica and Chandler's, Phoebe, Chandler, Joey, and Monica are there as Rachel
enters.]
Chandler| Hey! Did you have the baby yet?
Rachel| Do you want me to come over there and sit on you? Cause Ill
do it.
Monica| What are you doing here so early?
Rachel| They sent me home from work. They were like, "Start your maternity
leave now! Just rest, get ready for the baby." Well yknow what? Screw em!
If they dont want me there, Ill just hang out with you guys.
Phoebe| Or you can do volunteer work.
Joey| Hello?
Estelle| Joey! Its Estelle! Great news, I was able to get you and one
guest tickets to your premiere.
Joey| One guest? You told me I can have six tickets!
Estelle| Well, I sold four of them on Ebay. Youll be sitting next
to HotGuy372.
Joey| Oh my God. So thats it?! I only get to bring one guest?
Estelle| Yeah, what time do you wanna pick me up? (Joey hangs up on her.) Hello?
Joey| (to Monica, Chandler, and Phoebe) Did you hear that? I only get one extra
ticket to my premiere. So some how I have to pick between you three and Ross.
Rachel| (overhearing that) What-what about me?
Joey| You said you didnt want to go.
Rachel| I dont. But I would still like to be acknowledged. What? Just
because Im pregnant you think Im invisible.
Joey| Definitely not invisible.
Monica| Well, well Ross didnt care enough to be here, so I think hes
out. You snooze you lose.
Chandler| Hes not snoozing, hes teaching a class.
Monica| Well then somebodys snoozing. Joey, not that this uh should affect
you at all, but if you were to pick me, I was planning on wearing a sequined dress, cut
down to here. (Points to her stomach just above her belly button.)
Chandler| I havent seen this dress.
Monica| Star in a movie.
Phoebe| Joey, you pick who ever you want. Okay? You just listen to your heart.
What does it tell you? (Mimicking a heartbeat and tapping her chest.) Phoebe, Phoebe.
Joey| Well uhI think I want to take Chandler.
Phoebe| (still mimicking a heartbeat, only faster)
Phoebe-Phoebe-Phoebe-PhoebeBurrrrr! (Mimics the sound of a cardiac monitor going
off.)
Chandler| You really want to take me?
Joey| Yeah! Yeah! I mean Im sorry, I wish I can take everybody, but
yknow Chandler always supported my career. Hes paid for acting classes and
head shots and stuff and well this will be my way of paying you back.
Chandler| So youre never actually going to pay me back?
Monica| Wait a minute, just because he paid for your head shots youre
gonna take him? Joey, I dont think youre comprehending just how slutty this
dress is!
Joey| Its not just the stuff he paid for, I mean its-its
everything. Yknow? He read lines with me. He-he went with me on auditions when I was
really nervous, and then he consoled me after I didnt get parts that I really
wanted. You always believed in me man. Even, even when I didnt believe in myself.
Chandler| I always knew you were gonna make it. Im so proud of you.
Joey| Thanks. That means a lot to me.
Phoebe| Mon, maybe one of these guys wants to wear your dress.
Joey| (in a manly voice) Im gonna go shave. (Gets up.)
Chandler| (in a manly voice) Yeah well, Im gonna go spit. (He goes into
the bedroom. On his way out, Joey gives Rachel a wide berth.)
Rachel| Oh, I have to pee. If I dont come out in five minutes its
because Ive choked to death on the potpourri stink. (Goes into the bathroom.)
Phoebe| When she comes out, you hold her nose, Ill blow in her mouth, and
the kid will just (makes a popping sound) right out of her.
Monica| Shes over a week late! She gotta have it today, right?
Phoebe| I dont know. I-I think its still gonna be a while.
Monica| Hmm, care to make it interesting? Ill bet you that shell
have it by this time tomorrow.
Phoebe| Youre on!
Monica| Okay, how much?
Phoebe| One hundred thousand dollars!
Monica| How about fifty bucks?
Phoebe| Fine! Ill call Zurich and move some money around.
Rachel| (calling from the bathroom) All right, whos turn is it to help me
get up!
Phoebe| No ones here! (Monica looks at her.) Oh damnit!
[Scene| The World Premiere of Over There, Joey and Chandler are arriving in a limo and
are about to walk down the red carpet.]
Chandler| This is so exciting! Its so glamorous! People taking our
picture. How do I look?
Joey| A little tall.
Chandler| What?
Joey| Do you mind crouching down a little bit, so that I look taller? (Chandler
does so) There you go. (And they walk down the red carpet.)
Chandler| Its just so glamorous.
[Scene| Monica and Chandler's, Rachel is entering, still pregnant.]
Phoebe| Oh hey Mon? Rach is here! Ohh, youre still pregnant. Oh, Im
sorry. I know how uncomfortable you are. Yknow what? You look great. Yeah, like
fifty bucks.
Rachel| Oh, I have to go pee. Apparently this baby thinks that my bladder is a
squeeze toy. (Goes to the bathroom.)
Monica| Damnit! Damnit!! Heres your fifty bucks! (Pays Phoebe.)
Phoebe| Its interesting that you lost. Now, I forget, do you like to lose?
Monica| Now stop it! Double or nothing that she has it by tomorrow!
Phoebe| Fine! Youre on!
Monica| Okay.
Phoebe| Until then, General Grant, why dont you set up camp (She puts the
bill in her bra) right there.
Ross| (entering) Hey is Rachel here? We have a doctors appointment.
Monica| Shes in the bathroom.
Ross| Rach, we gotta go.
Rachel| In a minute!!!
Ross| People ask me why were not together, I just dont know what to
tell them.
Rachel| (entering) All right, all right. Lets go!
Ross| Uh, do you wanna go change first? The doctors keeping the office
open late for us, but if you hurry
Rachel| No, Im fine.
Ross| Really? You dont think thats a little inappropriate.
(Shes wearing a tank top and has her belly sticking out.)
Phoebe| Good God man dont anger it.
Rachel| Ross, it is 100 degrees outside. For the first time in weeks, I am
somewhat comfortable.
Ross| Fine! Fine! Yknow what? Whatever you want. Okay? Youre the
mommy.
Rachel| Oh uh-uh pal! Dont call me mommy! Its bad enough you call
your own mother that. (He looks at Monica.)
Monica| Im actually with her on this one.
[Scene| Inside Joeys Premiere, he is intently watching the movie.]
Joey| (onscreen) "I thought I knew who the enemy was, but it was you all
along."
Joey| (To Chandler) Okay, this is it. Its my big fight scene coming up.
(He looks over and Chandler and notices that hes asleep.)
[Scene| Dr. Longs Office, Ross and Rachel are waiting for the doctor. Ross is
drumming his fingers on the bed.]
Rachel| Ross.
Ross| Yeah?
Rachel| Can I ask you something?
Ross| Uh-huh.
Rachel| When Carol was pregnant with Ben
Ross| Mmm?
Rachel| were you this irritating?
Ross| Wow!
Rachel| Excuse me?!
Ross| Oh nothing. Nothing! Just uh, youve been a little short with me
lately. Im not trying to irritate you.
Rachel| Well then you just must have a natural talent for it.
Ross| Yknow what? The doctor will be in soon, why dont we not speak
until then.
Rachel| (silently) Okay. (Pause) Seriously, breathe louder Ross! Thats
great!
Ross| Yknow we should probably ask the doctor if she even knows how to
deliver a baby thats half human and half pure evil!
Rachel| Hi Dr. Long, how are you?
Ross| (to Rachel) Oh, youre nice to her.
Rachel| She has the drugs!
Dr. Long| Well do a quick check.
Rachel| Okay. (Rachel lies back.)
Dr. Long| So, eight days late huh?
Rachel| Yeah.
Dr. Long| You must be a little uncomfortable.
Rachel| Eh, just a tad.
Dr. Long| Youre about 80 percent effaced, so youre on your way. It
still could last a little while longer. If youre anxious there are a few ways to
help things along.
Ross| Do them!!
Dr. Long| Actually, theyre things you can do. Just some home remedies, but
in my experience Ive found that some of them are quite effective.
Rachel| Well, we are ready to try anything.
Dr. Long| Okay, theres an herbal tea you can drink.
Rachel| Okay.
Dr. Long| You can take some caster oil, theres eating spicy foods
Rachel| Great! We will do all of those.
Ross| Youve got to be kidding me!
[Scene| Joeys Premiere, the movie is ending and it takes the applause to wake up
Chandler.]
Chandler| Good job Joe! Well done! Top notch!
Joey| You liked it? You really liked it?
Chandler| Oh-ho-ho, yeah!
Joey| Which part exactly?
Chandler| The whole thing! Can we go?
Joey| Oh no-no-no, give me some specifics.
Chandler| I love the specifics, the specifics were the best part!
Joey| Hey, what about the scene with the kangaroo? Did-did you like that part?
Chandler| I was surprised to see a kangaroo in a World War I epic.
Joey| You fell asleep!! There was no kangaroo! They didnt take any of my
suggestions! Thats for coming buddy. Ill see you later. (Starts to walk out.)
Chandler| Dont go! Im sorry. Im so sorry! (Sees another guy
who is still asleep.) Look! This guy fell asleep! He fell asleep too! Be mad at him!
(Looks at him more closely.) Or, call an ambulance.
[Scene| Central Perk, Ross and Rachel are there as Phoebe and Monica enter.]
Monica| Hey!
Ross| Hey.
Rachel| Hi!
Monica| What did the doctor say? Any news on when the baby will come?
Rachel| No. But she did give us some ideas on how to induce labor.
Ross| Yeah, we tried them all. We went for a walk, uh we tried a special tea,
caster oil, spicy food nothing has worked.
Rachel| Well, there is one thing that we havent tried, but someone thinks
that, (mimicking Ross) "That will open up a can of worms."
Monica| Well what is it? What is it? If its gonna help bring the baby
here, like today. I mean, I think you should do it.
Ross| Its sex.
Monica| Do it!
Ross| Monica!
Monica| Im just saying its been a really long time for you. I mean,
women have needs. Do it, get yours!
Phoebe| Oh I-I dont know about that. No, I think that if the two of you
had sex the-the-the repercussions would be catastrophic.
Monica| All right, lets be practical, if Ross isnt willing to do it,
hes not the only guy in the world you can have sex with. You can borrow
ChandlerChandler is good!
Ross| Monica, what is the matter with you?
Monica| Nothing. I just want the baby to be born today.
Rachel| Why? Why today?
Monica| Okay fine! I keep betting Phoebe that youre gonna have the baby
and I dont want to lose again!
Ross| What?! While shes been going through this hell, youve been
making money?! Youre betting on your friend staying in this misery?! (Phoebe lowers
her head and shakes it yes.)
Rachel| Ill take that bet.
Ross| What?!
Rachel| Well, Im miserable here! I might as well make some money out it!
Ross| Can I get some of that action?
Monica| Wait a minute! Now Im betting against all three of you?
Rachel| Oh honey, dont worry. I really do feel like tomorrows the
day.
Monica| Oh, okay!
[Scene| Monica and Chandler's, Chandler is there as Joey enters.]
Joey| Hey! Sleeping beauty!
Chandler| Where have you been?! I tried to call you! I want to talk to you! I
still feel so bad!
Joey| (in a baby voice) Oh no, were you upset? Did you lose sleep?
Chandler| Im so sorry.
Joey| Uh-huh look, the only reason I can over here was to settle things between
us! Okay? Youve done a lot for me and my career, I wanted to pay you back so I took
you to the premiere but you missed it! Okay, so how much do I owe you?
Chandler| What?!
Joey| Give me a number, I dont want to owe you anything!
Chandler| You dont owe me anything, I dont want you money
Joey| Ah-ah-ah! Were doing this! Okay, now you got me my first set of head
shots. Right, how much were those?
Chandler| I dont know, five hundred dollars?
Joey| Okay, five hundred dollars. What else?
Chandler| Well then there was the second set, the infamous booger head shots.
Joey| Okay, so thats another five hundred. Five hundred and five hundred,
thats (Pauses to figure it out.)
Chandler| Do you want a calculator?
Joey| Please!
Chandler| Here! (Hands him one. Joey adds it up and discovers that he was
right.)
Joey| All right, what else?
Chandler| Well uh, there was acting classes, stage combat classes, tap
classes
Joey| Which were still keeping under our hats!
Chandler| Uh then there was that dialect coach who helped you with that play
where you needed a southern accent. Which after twenty hours of lessons still came out
Jamaican.
Joey| What the hell are you talking about, (in a Jamaican accent) "The
south will rise again man."
Chandler| Yes, money well spent!
Joey| Yeah. Okay, what else? Rent!
Chandler| Okay, two, three years of rent, utilities, food
Joey| Okay. Okay, so Im writing you a check forSo you fell asleep
during my movie. Big deal right? How do you clear this thing?
[Scene| Ross and Rachel's, Ross and Rachel are trying the home remedies again.]
Ross| Come on, finish your enchilada.
Rachel| Ross IWe tried all the spicy food. Its not working.
Ross| Okay here, have one of these peppers. Oh ha Oh God! Soso hot!
(Rubs his eyes.) Oh my(Laughs.) By the way, you dont want to touch the pepper
and then touch your eye.
Rachel| I am feeling nothing. Speaking of hot, watching you do that really makes
me want to have sex with you.
Ross| Stop it.
Rachel| Oh come on Ross, why are we wasting our time with this other stuff?! We
know whats gonna work! Its doctor recommended!
Ross| Im sorry, but we have to have some boundaries! My God, Im
dying.
Rachel| Oh come on Ross, weve done it before well do it again,
itll be a nice way to bookend the pregnancy.
Ross| This is insane, Im not gonna make love to you just so that
youll go into labor.
Rachel| Make love? What are you a girl?
Ross| Always a great way to get in a mans pants.
Rachel| But you will, you will be performing a service. Okay? Just-just think of
me as a ketchup bottle, yknow you sometimes you have to bang on the end of it just
to get something to come out.
Ross| I love when you talk dirty to me.
Rachel| Oh, I know it. Youre right. Thats not sexy. OhOh!
(Drops a fork on the floor.) Whoops! Oh, I seem to have dropped my fork. Let me just bed
over and get it. (Tries too, but cant quite seem to make it.) Oh God!
Ross| Okay enough! This is, this is not going to happen.
Rachel| Come on Ross! Im miserable here! Come on! You started this, now
you finish it! Come on wuss, make love to me.
Ross| Yknow what?
Rachel| What?!
Ross| Forget it.
Rachel| Oh wow! What now Ross youre not gonna talk? How on earth will you
ever annoy me? Oh wait a minute, I know. (Mimics his breathing.) I mean youd think
the damn jalepeno wouldve cleared up your sinuses, but no!! Thats not
enough (Ross jumps over and kisses her.) What are you doing?!
Ross| Im getting that baby out of you!
Rachel| (breaking the kiss) Oh God!
Ross| Oh, I know.
Rachel| Oh no. No-no! I think my water just broke.
Ross| I am good. Okay! Okay! Uh, I got the pillow! I got the bag! You got the
keys?
Rachel| Okay! I got the keys! Okay! Okay!
Ross| Hey!
Rachel| Yeah.
Ross| Were having a baby.
Rachel| I didnt uh, really have time to read this part of the books, but
do you think we have time to
Ross| Not so much.
Rachel| Okay.
[Scene| Monica and Chandler's, Monica is paying Phoebe.]
Monica| Two hundred.
Phoebe| Thank you!
Monica| Thats it. Im done. I dont care when the baby comes, no
more betting.
Phoebe| Okay.
Monica| Hello? (Listens) Uh-huh. (Listens) Uh-huh. (Listens) Okay. (Hangs up.) I
guess we can bet one more time.
Phoebe| Is Rachel having the baby?
Monica| How did you know that?! (Runs to yell at Joeys apartment.) Joey!
Chandler!! Its time!
Phoebe| Theyre at the coffeehouse.
Monica| You know everything!! Oh wait, double or nothing. I bet you the baby is
over seven pounds. (Phoebe isnt interested.) I bet you it has hair. (Shes
still not interested.) I bet you its a girl.
Phoebe| We know its a girl! (Exits.)
Monica| (following her) Ill give you really good odds.

[Scene| The Hospital, Ross and Rachel, whos in a wheelchair, are arriving in the
waiting room for the maternity ward.]
Ross| All right! (Checking his watch) Yes!! From home to the hospital in under
seven minutes! We did it!!
Rachel| (deadpan) Yes, the hard part is truly over.
Ross| No, but come on, were off to a great start arent we? I knew
Id get you here fast, but this has got to be some kind of a record!
Phoebe| Oh you made it!
Rachel| Hi! (Ross is stunned.)
Monica| How are you doing?
Ross| Wait a minute! How-how the hell did you beat us here?
Monica| We took a cab. Did you guys walk?
Ross| N No! We took a cab too, but I did test runs!
Chandler| Hi!
Joey| Hey! You made it!
Ross| Okay is theresome kind of magic tunnel to this hospital?!
Rachel| Ross, you stay here and talk, Im gonna go have a baby.
Ross| Okay. Okay. (To the nurse behind the desk.) Umm hi, this is Rachel Green.
Im Ross Geller. We-we called from the car.
Nurse| Right! We have a semi-private labor room waiting for you. So in just a
minute
Rachel| (interrupting her) Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa! Im sorry, semi-private? We
(Laughs), we asked for a private room.
Nurse| Yes, I see that here. Unfortunately we cant guarantee a private
room and currently theyre all unavailable.
Chandler| Man, if only youd gotten here sooner. (Ross turns and glares at
him.)
Nurse| Im sorry. Semi-private rooms are all we have.
Rachel| Okay. Just give us a second. Ross! (They walk away from the desk.)
Ross| Yeah?
Rachel| Give her some money.
Ross| I really think theyre out of rooms.
Rachel| Theyre not!! Ross, theyre just saving them for the important
people!! Okay?! What-what if I was the president?!
Ross| Well then wed be in a lot of trouble, you dont know where any
countries are. (Rachel glares at him.) Okay. (He goes over to the desk followed by
Rachel.) Uh, say would you umm Would you mind checking again to see if any umm,
private rooms may have (Handing her some money) opened up?
Nurse| This is a hospital.
Rachel| (standing up) Okay. Yknow what? Id have to say I really
dont care for your tone. And this is not the only hospital in this city and we have
no problem toWhoa! (She starts a contraction) Oh gosh! Whoa!
Ross| What-what?
Rachel| Ow! Ow! Contraction. (Sits back down.) Ow-ow! Ow-ow! (Starts breathing
heavily.)
Nurse| Would you like to see a semi-private room?
Rachel| Yeah, it couldnt hurt to look.
[Scene| The Semi-Private Labor Room, Rachel is in bed, Ross is fooling around, and Dr.
Long is checking on Rachel.]
Dr. Long| Well youre only two centimeters dilated and we need to get to
ten. Itll be a while.
Rachel| Oh, okay.
Dr. Long| Ill be back in an hour to check you again.
Ross| Thank you.
Rachel| Thank you. (Dr. Long exits.) Well, I guess we have some time to kill.
Ross| Yeah, guess so. Whew! Check these out! (Hes looking at the stirrups
on the other bed in the room and Rachel groans. Ross then hops into the bed and puts his
legs into the stirrups.) Never done this before.
Rachel| Yeah well it looks great!
Man| Thank you very much.
Woman| Thanks.
Ross| Hi! Hi, Im uh Ross. Im here to ruin this magical day for you.
Man| Oh no-no, not at all.
Woman| Dont worry about it.
Man| Marc Coreger, this is my wife Julie.
Ross| Hi Julie.
Julie| Hi.
Ross| This is Rachel. (Points at her.)
Rachel| Hi!
Marc| Oh hi Rachel.
Rachel| How are you?
Julie| Hi. Is this your first?
Rachel| Yeah it is.
Julie| Well, little Jamie here is our third. So, if you have questions or you
need anything at all, just holler.
Rachel| Thats so sweet.
Ross| Yeah.
Rachel| Oh.
Ross| Umm say, I-I opened this earlier (The privacy screen) but let me give you
guys some privacy.
Marc| No nonsense! Were all in this together.
Julie| Yeah, we are going to share every moment of this with you. And I think
were gonna have some fun.
Marc| Yeah.
Ross| Oh, okay.
Marc| Hey! Smile! (Points his camera at Ross and Rachel.)
Rachel| Oh no, I really dont want any(He takes the picture)Oh!
Thank you. Oh. Oh Ross
Ross| What?
Rachel| Here comes another contraction.
Ross| Oh. Okay, just breathe.
Julie| Oh honey, I think Im having one too!
Marc| Look at this! (Takes another picture) There we go!
[Scene| The Waiting Room, the rest of the gang is lounging around.]
Phoebe| (looking at the clock) Oh wow, three hours and still no baby. Ugh, the
miracle of birth sure is a snooze fest.
Monica| Hey, you wanna see something?
Phoebe| Sure! What?
Monica| Umm, this is going to be fun. Watch me freak out Chandler. Honey?
Chandler| Yeah?
Monica| Listen uh, I-Ive been doing some thinking, and I dont know
whether its because were here or Rachels giving birth but umm, I think
we should try to have a baby.
Chandler| Okay.
Monica| (freaking out) What-what-whats that now?!
Chandler| Okay. Ive been thinking about it too, and I, I think were
ready.
Monica| What?! Are you kidding me?! You-you-you think were ready to have a
baby now?!
Phoebe| Oh, this is fun.
Joey| Youre ready to have a baby? My boys all grown up!
Chandler| But you said you were ready too.
Monica| Yeah but I was just screwing with you to try to get your voice all high
and weird like mine is now!
Chandler| Yes, but havent you wanted a kid like forever?
Monica| Okay, just back off mister! Whoa. (Pause) Cause I am ready
to have a baby. I just want Joey to be the father.
Joey| (voice all high and weird) What?! Are you crazy?!
Monica| Thats it! Right there! Is all I wanted!
[Scene| The Semi-Private Labor Room, time lapse, Ross is massaging out a cramp on
Rachels hip as Marc opens up the privacy screen.]
Marc| I am so sorry. The doctor insisted on closing the curtain for the exam.
Rachel| Oh, thats veryReally very-very okay.
Marc| Julies cervix is dilated a seven centimeters, thats about four
fingers. The doctor let me feel it myself.
Julie| Have you felt Rachels cervix Ross?
Rachel| (simultaneously as Ross) No, I dont think well be doing
that.
Ross| (simultaneously as Rachel) Were not gonna do that.
Julie| Well, if you like you can feel Rachels and then feel mine to
compare.
Mrs. Geller| (entering) Am I interrupting?
Ross| Uh yes! Thank you.
Rachel| Oh. Oh wait no.
Ross| Later.
Rachel| No-no-dont! Dont leave me here with these people.
Ross| Oh uh, Im sorry. (Runs out.)
Rachel| No Ross! Ross! Ross! My child has no father!
[Scene| The Hallway, Ross comes out and hugs Mrs. Geller.]
Ross| Hi! Im so glad youre here, but its gonna be a while. I-I
wished youd called first.
Mrs. Geller| Oh thats all right, Im coming back later with your
father.
Ross| Oh good.
Mrs. Geller| I actually needed to talk to you before the birth.
Ross| Okay, whats up?
Mrs. Geller| I brought something that I want to give you, assuming of course
that you want it. (She holds up an engagement ring.)
Ross| Ma, youre asking me to marry you?
Mrs. Geller| This is your grandmothers engagement ring, I want you to give
it to Rachel.
Ross| Mom no, come on! Thank you.
Mrs. Geller| Just hear me out!
Ross| N-no! Okay? Weve been through this! Were not gonna get married
just because shes pregnant, okay?
Mrs. Geller| Honestly! Ross, this isnt just some girl you picked up in a
bar and humped. A child should have a family.
Ross| Mom, yknow what? I-I cant deal with this right now. Im
sorry
Mrs. Geller| Justthink about it. If you dont, Ill talk more
about humping.
Ross| Gimmie! (Takes the ring and puts it in his coat pocket as Rachel enters
the hallway.)
Rachel| Hi!
Mrs. Geller| Oh hi dear!
Rachel| Oh, thank you so much for coming. Ross, get in here!
[Scene| The Waiting Room, Ross is explaining to the gang what happened with his
mother.]
Ross| she came and dragged me out of the labor room to ask me why Im
not with Rachel.
Phoebe| Yeah. (Pause) Why arent you with Rachel?
Ross| Are you kidding? Look, were not gonna be together just because
were having a baby. Okay?
Phoebe| But yknow what? It just seems that you two belong together.
Ross| Okay, stop it! I cant deal with this right now. I have to go have a
baby.
Phoebe| Right. And with who again? (Ross exits.)
Joey| God. Hes crazy! Why doesnt he want to be with Rachel?
Phoebe| I know!
Joey| I mean seriously, shes like the perfect woman. I mean I know she
turned me down, but if she hadnt and wanted to be with me, I would take her in my
arms and (Realizes everyone is staring.) I havent bummed you guys out like
this in a while have I?
[Scene| The Semi-Private Labor Room, Ross is returning to find another couple has taken
the place of Marc and Julie.]
Ross| (To Rachel) Hey. Whos that?
Rachel| New people.
Ross| What happened to the Disgustingtons?
Rachel| Theyre having their baby! Its not fair Ross we got here
first! Right after you left they wheeled her off into delivery. Oh but not before she gave
me a juicy shot of little Jamie just crowning away.
Ross| Wow! Sorry. So uh, how are the new people?
Rachel| Well they have uh, some unusual pet names for each other. Including umm,
evil bitch and uh, sick bastard. Oh God oh! Contraction!
Ross| Yeah? Okay.
Rachel| Ooh! Ow!!
Evil Bitch| Are you looking at her?!
Sick Bastard| No!
Evil Bitch| Dont you look at her you sick bastard!
Sick Bastard| Honey I swear! I wasnt looking at her!
Evil Bitch| Shes in labor! You like that you sick son of a bitch!
Ross| Umm. Umm, Im-Im just gonna(Closes the privacy screen.)
Evil Bitch| See? See? It was because you were looking fat pervert!
Ross| No-no, ImIm sure no one was looking. Just want some
privacy. (He closes the screen and stares wide-eyed at Rachel.)
Evil Bitch| You miss your girlfriend?
Ross| Just ignore them.
Rachel| Ross.
Ross| What? What?
Rachel| Hes looking at me.
Ross| (to him) Hey! You wanna live to see your baby?!
Evil Bitch| Dont you talk to my husband like that you stupid bastard!
[Scene| Outside the Nursery, Chandler is looking at the babies as Monica walks up.]
Monica| Oh good God! If you want a baby so bad just go steal it!
Monica| What is going on with you? Since when are you so crazy about babies?
Chandler| Im not crazy about babies. Im crazy about us.
Monica| What?
Chandler| Look, weve always talked about having babies someday. Im
not saying it has to be right now, but Im starting to think that we can handle it.
Were good. Were really good.
Monica| We are pretty good.
Chandler| But nothing has to happen until your ready.
Monica| Well maybe Im ready now. I mean, its a little scary, but
maybe its right.
Chandler| What?! Its not right! Were not ready to have a kid now!!
Monica| What?!!
Chandler| Im kidding. This is going to be fun.
Monica| So were gonna try? I mean, are we trying?
Chandler| Were trying to get pregnant. (They start kissing, but Chandler
stops it.) Yknow Im not really comfortable doing this in front of the babies.
So, when do you want to start trying?
Monica| Okay, hold on a sec.
Chandler| Period math?
Monica| Yeah.
Chandler| Yeah.
Monica| Well, we could start trying. Now.
Chandler| Right here?
Monica| No, not here. Maybe here.
Chandler| Wait a minute, its perfect. We got a lot of time to kill and
were in a building thats full of beds!
Monica| And its so clean!!
[Scene| The Vending Machines, Phoebe is buying a soda and Joey is shaking the candy
machine.]
Joey| Come on you stupid machine! Come on!
Phoebe| Oh, it ate your money?
Joey| (looking at her) No.
Phoebe| All right, Ill see you downstairs then.
Joey| All right.
Phoebe| All right.
Joey| Hey I got one! I got one!
Man| Hi!
Phoebe| Hi.
Man| Oh uh, up or down?
Phoebe| Oh down please. (The guy tries to reach the button, but cant.) I-I
hate to be a ball buster can I just do it? (She pushes the button.)
Man| Could you press up too please?
Phoebe| Sure! I feel so bad for you; I broke my leg once too.
Man| Oh yeah? Howd yours happen?
Phoebe| Well, its a long story. Its kind of embarrassing. Lets
just say there was a typographical error with a sex manual. (The guy laughs.) How about
you?
Man| Car accident.
Phoebe| Oh.
Man| Oh, let me guess some idiot on a cell phone wasnt paying attention?
Man| Yeah. Me. (The elevator door opens.) Oh hey, thats me. (Rolls onto
the elevator.) Hey uh, I take it youre just visiting someone.
Phoebe| Uh-huh, yeah.
Man| Well umm, if you have sometime yknow and maybe you might want to
visit someone else
Phoebe| Oh yeah! I-I would like that.
Man| Im in the middle (The elevator door closes, cutting him off.)
Phoebe| Wait! What?! No!! Elevator!! No!
Joey| (standing behind her) Uh, you gotta press the button. (Does so.)
[Scene| The Semi-Private Labor Room, Evil Bitch and Sick Bastard are gone and Ross has
just finished talking to a nurse as Rachel stands and stretches.]
Ross| The nurse said theyre bringing in another woman.
Rachel| Ugh, is she pregnant yet? She doesnt need to be; shell still
have the baby before I do. Oh Ross, another contraction! (Leans back on Ross for some
support.)
Ross| Thats it. Thats it.
Woman| Oooh, that sounded like a bad one.
Rachel| Yeah it was.
Woman| Mine havent been so bad. Oh! Here comes one now. (Hums then squeals
a little bit.) Oh, that was a big one!
[Scene| Another Waiting Room, Phoebe and Joey are trying to find out where the guy with
the broken leg is.]
Phoebe| (to the nurse) Excuse me? Could you help me with something? The patient
Im looking for has a broken leg and is in a wheelchair. And umm, hes like
early to mid-thirties, very attractive.
Nurse| I think I know who youre talking about.
Phoebe| Oh yay! Great! Okay, what room number is he in?
Nurse| Im sorry, that information is restricted to hospital staff
Joey| (walks up) Uh, shes with me. (Introduces himself) Dr. Drake Remoray.
Nurse| Dr. Drake who?
Joey| Remoray. Its Portuguese. We need that information; Im a
doctor.
Nurse| A doctor at this hospital?
Joey| Damnit woman were losing precious time! Now do you want this
mans blood on your head?
Phoebe| Hands.
Joey| Hands! It is absolutely essential that you tell me what room the man my
assistant described is staying in. Hes a patient of mine, Ive been treating
him for years!
Nurse| Hes in room 816.
Joey| 816, thank you!
Phoebe| Thank you. (Starts to exit.)
Joey| And what is his name?
Phoebe| (coming back for Joey) No! (Grabs Joey and drags him away.)
[Scene| An Empty Hospital Room, Chandler and Monica enter.]
Monica| I think we found a place.
Chandler| Okay. (They start kissing.)
Monica| Umm, wait! Do you want to set the mood a little?
Chandler| Okay. Uh, well dim the lights, dim the lights. (He goes to the
light switch and finds its not a dimmer switch when he flips the lights off.) Or
turn them out all together. Uh, no scented candles. Okay here. Here we go. (He sprays an
aerosol air freshener above her.)
Monica| Okay! Okay! Make me sterile, but okay.
Monica| Okay. Lets hurryOh wait! Do we have a condom? (He looks at
her.) Oh right! (Laughs and they resume making out when a nurse catches them in the act.)
Chandler| Yes, 98.6. Youre gonna be fine.
[Scene| Outside Room 816, Phoebe and Joey are approaching.]
Phoebe| Ooh, this is it! (Looks in the window.) Oh, thats him! Thats
him!
Joey| Great! Go get him.
Phoebe| Wait a second, or maybe you can go in first.
Joey| (looks in the window) Hes not really my type.
Phoebe| No not you, Dr. Drake Remoray. You can ask him questions and see
whats he like. People tell doctors everything.
Joey| But you said he was this great guy!
Phoebe| But lately all the guys I meet seem really nice at first, then they turn
out to be the biggest jerks.
Joey| You do attract some stinkers.
[Scene| The Semi-Private Labor Room, Dr. Long is checking on Rachel again.]
Rachel| Dr. Long, Ive been at this for seventeen hours! Three women have
come and gone with their babies, you gotta give me some good news! How many centimeters am
I dilated? Eight? Nine?
Dr. Long| Three.
Ross| Just three?! Im dilated three!
Dr. Long| We are moving along, just slowly. (Rachel lies back and sighs.)
Dont worry, youre doing great. Ill be back soon. (Exits.)
Rachel| Hey, yknow what? Im not waiting! Im gonna push this
baby out! Im doing it! I mean its what? Three centimeters? Thats gotta
be like this! (Holds her hands a couple inches apart.)
Ross| Actually its more like this. (Pushes her hands to less than an inch
apart.)
Rachel| Oh stupid metric system!
Doctor| Oh my. Were gonna need to take you straight to the delivery room.
Rachel| Oh for the love of God!
Woman Giving Birth| (yelling from the hallway) Its coming! Its
coming!
Doctor| And here it is! (The baby cries.)
Rachel| Oh come on!!
[Scene| Room 816, Dr. Drake Remoray is entering.]
Joey| Hi! Im Dr. Drake Remoray and I have a few routine questions I need
to ask you.
Man| Really? Ive been dealing with Dr. Wells.
Joey| I know, but Im a neurologist. And just to be on the safe side, Dr.
Wells wanted a more comprehensive overview of you status so he sent me.
Man| Dr. Wells is a woman.
Joey| That was a test. Good response. All right, full name.
Man| Clifford Burnett.
Joey| Date of birth?
Cliff| November 16th, 1968.
Joey| Age?
Cliff| Cant you figure that out based on my date of birth?
Joey| Im a doctor Cliff, not a mathematician.
Cliff| Im 33.
Joey| Okay. And uh, are you married.
Cliff| No.
Joey| Oh really? So, 33 and still single, would you say you have commitment
issues?
Cliff| Are all the questions this personal?
Joey| (checking the list) Yes.
Cliff| Well uh if you must know Im a widower.
Joey| Oh thats terrible. Im-Im really sorry.
Cliff| Yeah.
Joey| Hmm. Do you sleep with women and never call them again?
Cliff| No.
Joey| Excellent! Excellent! And uh, finally, are you into any weird stuff
yknow, sexually?
Cliff| No!
Joey| Oooh, wrong answer. (Exits.)
[Scene| The Semi-Private Labor Room, theyre brining in yet another woman.]
Nurse| (calling to the woman) This rooms available.
Rachel| Okay! Okay wait! You listen to me! You listen to me! Since I have been
waiting four women, thats four, one higher than the number of centimeters that I am
dilated, have come and gone with their babies! Im next! Its my turn! Its
only fair! And if you bring in one woman and she has her baby before me Im going to
sue you! Not this hospital, Im going to sue you! And my husband (Points at Ross)
hes a lawyer!
Ross| Uh Rach
Rachel| Go get back on that case honey!
Nurse| I dont think the next patient is very far along.
Rachel| Okay, well then bring her in.
Woman| OH.MY.GAWD!!! (Uh-huh, its Janice.)
[Scene| The Semi-Private Labor Room, continued from earlier.]
Janice| I.cant.believe this!
Ross| And yet somehow its true!
Janice| I mean this is so great! Were gonna be baby buddies! (Does the
laugh.)
Ross| (To Rachel) Squeeze your legs together and cover the babys ears!
Man| (entering, carrying a pillow) Hi sweetie!
Janice| Hi! Hi sweetheart! This is my husband Sid, I dont think
youve met him. Ross, Rachel, this is Sid. I nabbed him a year ago at the
dermatologists office. Thank God for adult acne huh? (Does the laugh.)
Sid| I still cant believe it! Im the luckiest guy in the world!
Ross| (softly) Really?
Sid| (To Janice) Whatd he say?
Janice| Oh yknow what? You have to speak very loudly when youre
talking to Sid, because hes almost completely deaf.
Rachel| Oh!
Ross| Oh there you go!
Rachel| I get it!
Janice| So? Congratulations you two, I didnt even know you got married.
Rachel| Oh we-we didnt.
Ross| No-no. We
Janice| What?!
Ross| Um uhWere-were just having this baby together but uh, uh
thats all.
Janice| Why?!!
Ross| Uh well ummwere just not in that place, yknow? But
were very excited about this.
Janice| Oh. Well then shut me up. (Does the laugh.)
Rachel| Just tell me how.
Janice| Uh-oh, I feel another one coming. (She makes a sound like a goose during
the contraction.)
Ross| Sid you lucky deaf bastard.
[Scene| Outside Room 816, Joey is briefing Phoebe on Cliff.]
Phoebe| What else? What else?
Joey| Uh, well hes 33.
Phoebe| Oh. Ah-uh.
Joey| A widower.
Phoebe| Oh.
Joey| He seemed like a stand up guy. Oh, and hes not into anything weird
sexually.
Phoebe| Enter Pheebs.
[Scene| Another Hospital Room, Chandler and Monica enter and start making out.]
Chandler| Should we tell Rachel theres an empty private room right next
door to hers?
Monica| We could, or we can have sex in it.
Chandler| Well let me think about that, while I remove my pants!
Monica| (lying down on the bed) Okay mister! Fertilize me!
Monica| Does that sound like Janice?
Chandler| If its not, then theres two of them. And that would mean
its the end of the world!
[Scene| The Semi-Private Labor Room, Chandler and Monica are entering to see if they in
fact did hear Janice.]
Monica| Hey!
Ross| Hey!
Chandler| Hi.
Rachel| Oh hi.
Monica| I cant believe this is taking so long. How are you doing?
Rachel| Oh not bad. Do you know that feeling when youre trying to blow a
Saint Bernard out your ass?
Chandler| Weirdest thing. Did I hear(A nurse opens the privacy screen and
Chandler sees Janice)Mother of God its true!
Janice| Chandler Bing!
Chandler| Jan-Janice!
Ross| Not just Janice, Janice in labor, contracting and everything.
Janice| Oh, this should be easy. I have a very wide pelvis. You remember
Chandler.
Chandler| Janice I didnt even know you were pregnant! Whos the
unwitting human whos essence youve stolen?
Janice| Its you. This is yours.
Chandler| What?!
Janice| (laughs) Look how nervous he gets! We havent slept together in
years! (Laughs again.)
Chandler| Thats funny. Does it-does it hurt? Does the labor hurt?
[Scene| Room 816, Phoebe is making her move on Cliff.]
Phoebe| Okay Ive got one for you, if you had too which one would you
rather eat, a seeing eye dog or a talking gorilla?
Cliff| Id have to saythe talking gorilla, because at least I can
explain to him that youre making me eat him.
Phoebe| Somebody went to college. Wow. (Cliff gets uncomfortable) What is it?
Im sorry. (She moves her arm, which was resting on the same pillow his leg is.)
Cliff| No, Im sorry. Its just my foot itches like crazy.
Phoebe| Oh, Ill get it. (She gets up and grabs a spoon.)
Cliff| Wow! I usually get to know a girl a little better before I let her spoon
me.
Phoebe| Relax, its not like were forking.
[Scene| The Semi-Private Labor Room, Janice is being moved to the delivery room and is
screaming in pain.]
Rachel| Oh thats five Ross. Five women have had five babies! And I have
had no babies! Why doesnt she want to come out?
Ross| Yknow what I think it is? I think youve made such a nice home
for her over the last nine months that she just doesnt want to leave.
Rachel| Oh. Look at you making up crap for me. Oh God! (Starts another
contraction as Dr. Long enters.)
Dr. Long| Twenty-one hours, youre a hero.
Rachel| Doctor you gotta do something! I think you gotta give me drugs or you
gotta light a fire up in there and just smoke it out.
Dr. Long| Actually, I think youre ready to go to the delivery room.
Rachel| What?
Dr. Long| Ten centimeters, youre about to become a mom.
Rachel| My God. Okay. (Another woman enters.) Ha-ha-ha beat ya! Sucker!
[Scene| Room 816, Phoebe and Cliff are eating some pudding with spoons.]
Cliff| Is this the same spoon that was in my cast? (Smells it.)
Phoebe| Yknow what? This one is. (Eats another spoonful of pudding as
Cliff sees something on TV.)
Cliff| Oh my God! Thats the doctor who was in my room before!
Phoebe| Huh. Okay, Mr. Perkazet.
Cliff| Im telling you! The guy from that show was here in my room, asking
me all these weird questions!
Phoebe| Cliff, do you really believe that a character from a TV show was here in
your room?
Joey| (entering) Rachels having her baby!! (Phoebe turns and looks at
him.) Which is of no interest to me, Im a neurologist.
Cliff| That-thats him! You know him?
Phoebe| Okay. Okay. IOkay ummthisI-I sent my friend Joey in
here to find out stuff about you. Umm yknow, if it helps you came off great. A lot
better than Im coming off right now.
Cliff| I dont believe this. You got him to pretend he was some fake
doctor?
Joey| Fake? Excuse me? Hello? (Taps the TV screen.)
Cliff| And then you tried to make me think that I was crazy.
Phoebe| Youre right, that was wrong. Im sorry. Im so sorry.
Its just that I liked you so much. Can we just, can we just start over?
Cliff| I dont think so.
Joey| Uh, if I may? Umm-umm look, Cliff, you told me a lot of personal stuff
about you, right? And maybe-maybe it would if-if would help if-if you knew some personal
stuff about her. Uh, she was married to a gay ice dancer. Uh, she gave birth to her
brothers triplets. Oh! Oh! Her-her twin sister used to do porn!
Phoebe| Uh Joey, were trying to dial down the crazy.
Joey| Right!
Phoebe| Umm, look we dont, we dont really know each other so it
would be really easy to just forget about this, but there seems to be something between
us. And I dont know about you but that doesnt happen to me a lot.
Cliff| It doesnt happen to me either.
Joey| Me neither.
[Scene| The Delivery Room, Rachel is finally giving birth.]
Dr. Long| Push. Push. Come on push for five seconds. 54
Rachel| 3-2-1 oh!!
Dr. Long| Okay, the next contraction should be in about twenty seconds.
Rachel| I cant. I cant push anymore, I cant.
Ross| Sweetie youre doing great.
Rachel| Oh God twenty seconds my ass!!
Dr. Long| Here we go! Okay, keep pushing! Wait! I see something.
Ross| What? You do? You do? (Looks) Oh my God!
Rachel| Dont say, "Oh my God!" Oh my God what?
Ross| What is that?
Dr. Long| Its the babys buttock, shes breech.
Ross| Oh thank God, I thought she had two heads.
Rachel| Oh God. Is she gonna be okay?
Dr. Long| Shes gonna be fine. Okay, shes in a more difficult
position so youre gonna have to push even harder now. Go! Push!
Ross| Go!
Dr. Long| Rachel youre gonna have to push even harder, nothings
happening!
Rachel| Im sorry, I cant!
Ross| Yes you can!
Rachel| I cant!
Ross| Hey! Hey! Come on! You can! I know you can do this! Lets go!
Rachel| I cant. Please, you do it for me.
Ross| No! Come on letsOne more time! One final push! Ready?
123! (Rachel pushes so hard her head snaps up head-butting Ross and knocking
him down.)
Dr. Long| Good!
Ross| (from the floor) Keep pushing!
Rachel| Are you okay?
Ross| You have no idea how much this hurts. (All of the women in the room turn
and glare at him.) Keep going! Keep going!
Dr. Long| Here we go!
Ross| Oh! Oh! Shes upside down but shes coming! Shes coming!
Rachel| Oh God!
Ross| Oh! Oh my God oh! Oh my God shes here.
Ross| Oh shesshes perfect.
Rachel| Oh, shes so tiny. (Starts crying) Whered she go?
Ross| Oh its okay. Theyre just-theyre just wrapping her up.
Rachel| Okay. Well be careful with her, shes really tiny.
Dr. Long| Here she is!
Rachel| Oh hey you. Thanks for coming out of me. (The baby cries.) I know. Oh.
Yeah. Oh, shes looking at me. Hi! I know you.
Dr. Long| Do we have a name yet?
Rachel| No, not yet.
Dr. Long| Thats fine, for now well just call her Baby Girl Green.
Rachel| Oh no, Baby Girl Geller-Green.
Rachel| Hello baby girl.
[Scene| The Recovery Room, Ross is taking pictures of Rachel holding the baby as the
rest of the gang enters.]
Phoebe| Can we come in?
Ross| Oh, come in.
Phoebe| Hi!
Joey| There she is!
Phoebe| Oh, shes so beautiful.
Rachel| Here. (Hands her to Monica.)
Monica| Oh my God! Shes amazing. Oh, oh Im so glad you guys got
drunk and had sex!
Chandler| Its incredible, I mean one minute shes inside you and then
47 hours later here she is.
Joey| (taking the baby) She looks so real! (The gang looks at him.) Yknow
what I mean! Shes this whole tiny little person. She already has eyelashes and knees
anduh-oh.
Rachel| What?
Joey| Oh no-no, no for I second there I counted six fingers, but one was from
the other hand so were good.
Phoebe| Okay, my turn. My turn. (Joey hands her to Phoebe.) Oh! Youre so
cute! Oh, I could squeeze your little head! (Pause) I wont.
Monica| Whats the matter?
Rachel| Oh nothing I Sorry, I just cant stop crying.
Ross| The doctor says its completely normal with all the hormones. Plus,
you-youre sleep deprived.
Rachel| So? You guys are all sleep deprived. I dont see you weeping
because you put your slippers on the wrong feet. Oh God. (Starts to cry harder.)
Joey| Whats the matter now?
Rachel| I was reliving it.
Phoebe| Ohhh. (Hands her back to Rachel.)
Chandler| So, do you know what youre gonna call her yet?
Phoebe| Oh, wait a minute its not gonna be Baby Girl? I thought that was
so original!
Ross| Uh actually, we-weve narrowed it down to two names.
Rachel| Yeah, and yknow what? I love them both, so why dont you just
pick one and thatll be it.
Ross| Wow! Umm, okay uheveryonethisis Isabella. (Rachel starts
crying.) What?
Rachel| Thats not her name! Im sorry, she just doesnt feel
like an Isabella.
Chandler| So then I guess Ferdinad is out.
Joey| What was the other one Ross?
Ross| Umm, Delilah.
Rachel| Oh great! Suddenly she sounds like a biblical whore.
Ross| So I guess were back to uh, Baby Girl.
Phoebe| Yay!
Rachel| Well what are we going to do?
Monica| Its okay honey, youll find a name.
Ross| Ugh, easy for you to say, you already know what your kids names are going
to be.
Chandler| You do?
Monica| Yeah, Ive had them picked out since I was fourteen.
Chandler| Oh no, its gonna be named after some snack or baked good
isnt it?
Rachel| Well tell us! What are they?
Monica| Umm, okay. If its a boy its Daniel.
Rachel| And if its a girl?
Monica| I dont want to say.
Rachel| Oh, just tell us! Were not gonna want it!
Monica| Okay. Its Emma.
Rachel| (gasps) Emma! (Looks at the baby and starts to cry.) See? I dont
want it.
Monica| Take it.
Rachel| What?
Monica| Its clearly an Emma.
Rachel| Oh honey, but you love that name.
Monica| Yeah, but I love you more. Besides yknow, nothing goes with Bing.
So Im screwed. I mean (Rachel hands Emma to Monica.) Oh, hi Emma. Yeah,
thats you. Youre our little Em. Oh whats that honey? What? Oh, you want
a little cousin? (To Chandler) You want a cousin right now?!
[Scene| A Janitorial Closet, Monica and Chandler are emerging slowly.]
Chandler| That was amazing.
Monica| I know. Hey, do you realize we may have just changed our lives forever?
We may have just started a family. Nine months from now we can be here, having our own
baby.
Chandler| And if not, we got to do it on a bucket.
[Scene| The Recovery Room, Rachel is putting Emma down for a nap.]
Janice| (entering) Yoo-hoo! Aaron Litman-Neurolic would like to say hello to his
future bride.
Rachel| Ohhh! (Looks at Aaron and recoils in horror.) Wow! He kinda takes your
breath away doesnt he?
Janice| Hes a keeper. How are you feeling?
Rachel| Oh, Im fine. (Gasps in pain as she sits down.)
Janice| Can I just say, I really admire what youre doing. Just raising her
all alone.
Rachel| Oh, Im not doing it alone. I have Ross.
Janice| Oh, sure. Now. But what happens when he meets somebody else and gets
married?
Rachel| Well then he gets a divorce, its Ross!
Janice| Im telling you Rachel, listen to Janice. They all say theyre
gonna be there until they start their real family.
Rachel| Well IThats never gonna happen with Ross.
Janice| Oh well thats what I thought about my first husband, now Im
lucky if my kid gets to spend the weekend with her father and the twins and little Ms. New
Boobs.
Rachel| Really?
Janice| I hate to be the one to say it, but honey you two (Her and Emma) are on
your own.
Rachel| Well ThatsyknowThatsWeve
been alone for the last twenty minutes were doing okay. Besides yknow what?
I-IMaybe we wont be alone, cause lately I-Ithings have been
happening between me and Ross, yknow? Right before I went into labor, we-we had this
kiss. Yknow? So it might be thethe beginning of something.
Ross| (entering) Hey Janice!
Janice| Oh hi!
Ross| Whos this little guy? (Gasps when he sees Aaron.)
Janice| Say hello to Aaron, your future son-in-law.
Ross| No-no. No.
Janice| Im gonna leave the three of you alone.
Ross| Okay.
Janice| Bye. (Exits.)
Ross| Man! Did you see the kid on that nose?
Rachel| Uh-huh. (Ross takes off his coat and sets in on a chair.) Yknow
what I was, I was thinking about?
Ross| Huh?
Rachel| Ummthat kiss before we left the apartment. That was some-something
huh?
Ross| Yeah. Yeah, it really was. But wewe gotta be careful. Wewe
cant let that happen again, yknow?
Rachel| (pause) Right.
Ross| I mean we dont want to go down that road do we?
Rachel| No! No, of course not. No. Thats why I brought it up. (Pause) They
didnt have any sodas?
Ross| Oh my God! Im sorry, I was talking to this nurse, completely forgot.
Rachel| Thats all right. (He goes to get her a soda.) And so it begins.
[Scene| Outside the Nursery, Ross is looking at Emma as Phoebe walks up.]
Phoebe| Is she in there?
Ross| Yeah. Shes putting her down now, thats her. (Points to the
nurse putting Emma now.)
Phoebe| Oh!
Ross| Look at Emma!
Phoebe| I just cant decide who she looks more alike, you or Rachel?
Ross| Oh what are you kidding? Shes gorgeous, its all Rachel.
Phoebe| Im sorry, for the last time, why arent you two together
again? (Silence from Ross.) No, I know. I know, because youre not in that place.
Which would be fine, except you totally are.
Ross| Itsits complicated okay?
Phoebe| Yeah thats true. Yeah, you love her. You always have. You have a
child together. There is no right answer.
Ross| Look, weve been together. Okay? And then apart, and then together,
and then apart, and now we have a baby. (Pause) Its just if-if we got together again
and it didnt work outI could never do that to Emma. I mean she-she thinking
everything(Starts to cry.) Oh thatsnow me. What do they put something in
the water in this place? Since Rachel and I were doing really, were doing
really well right now.
Phoebe| I know. I know. I know. I know, and if you try to make it more you might
wreck it.
Ross| Yeah, exactly.
Phoebe| Right. (Pause) Or you might get everything youve wanted since you
were fifteen.
[Scene| The Delivery Room, Rachel is in bed as Joey enters.]
Joey| Hey. I just saw a woman breast feeding both of her twins at the same time;
it is like a freak show up here. (Notices shes wiping her eyes.) Whats the
matter?
Rachel| Nothing.
Joey| What is it? Hey!
Rachel| Really its nothing. Im just
Joey| Rach come on, what?
Rachel| Ive just been thinking about how my baby and I are gonna be all
alone.
Joey| What are you talking about alone? What about Ross?
Rachel| Oh please, hell be with his real family, the twins and little miss
new boobs.
Joey| Okay, how long was I watching that woman?
Rachel| Im just saying that yknow, someday Ross is gonna meet
somebody andhes gonna have his own life. Right?
Joey| Yeah, I guess so.
Rachel| I just never thought I would raise this baby all by myself. Pretty dumb
huh?
Joey| Hey, listen to me, listen to meyou are never ever gonna be
alone. Okay? I promise thats not gonna happen.
Rachel| Joey. Honey what would I do without you?
Joey| You dont have to worry about that okay?
Rachel| Oh, hon can you grab me my other box of tissues? Theyre right on
that chair under Rosss coat.
Joey| Sure.
Rachel| Okay.
Joey| My God.
Rachel| Joey.
Rachel| (seeing the ring) Oh my God. (Pause) Okay.
