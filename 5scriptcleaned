[Scene| Rosss Wedding, continued from last season, the Minister is about to marry

Minister| Friends. Family. We are gathered to celebrate here today the joyous
union of Ross and Emily. (Time lapse) Now Ross, repeat after me. I Ross...
Ross| I Ross...
Minister| Take thee, Emily...
Ross| Take thee, Rachel...(All his friends have looks of shock on their faces.
He realizes what he said. Quickly he says.) Emily. (A slight chuckle.) Emily.
Minister| (Looking and feeling awkward. he looks towards Emily.) Uhh...Shall I
go on?
Rachel| (To the woman sitting in front of her) He-he said Rachel, right? Do you
think I should go up there?
Emily| Yes, yes, do go on.
Minister| I think wed better start again. Ross, repeat after me. I,
Ross
Ross| I, Ross
Minister| Take thee, EM-I-LY
Ross| Take thee, (Glares at the Minister) Emily. (Chuckles) Like
thered be anybody else. (Emily is glaring at him.)
Minister| As my lawfully wedded wife, in sickness and in health, till death
parts us.
Ross| As my lawfully wedded wife, in sickness and in health, until death parts
us. Really, I do. Emily. (Points at her.)
Minister| May I have the rings? (He is given the rings) Emily, place this ring
on Rosss finger as a symbol of your bond everlasting. (She jams the ring onto his
finger) Ross, place this ring in Emilys hand as a symbol of the love that encircles
you forever.
Ross| Happy too.
Minister| Ross and Emily have made their declarations and it gives me great
pleasure to declare them husband and wife.
Ross| Yay!
Minister| You may kiss the bride.
Mrs. Geller| (To Mr. Geller) This is worse than when he married the lesbian.
Emily| Just keep smiling.
Ross| Okay.
Joey| Well, that went well. Yeah.
Chandler| It couldve been worse, he couldve shot her.
Ross| (laughs) That uh, that was pretty funny. Wasnt it?
[Scene| The Wedding reception, Ross and Emily are in the bathroom and Emily is yelling
at him. Rachel, Chandler, Joey, and Monica are standing outside the doorway.]
Emily| (Yelling from inside the bathroom) Youve spoiled everything!
Its like a nightmare! My friends and family are out there! How can I face them?! How
can you do this to me?!
Joey| (To the gang) Hey, no matter what happens with Ross and Emily, we still
get cake right?
Ross| (exiting the bathroom) That-that-thats all right, no honey, you take
your time sweetie. Ill be right out here. (She slams the door in his face, to the
gang) Shes just fixing her makeup.
Emily| I hate you!!
Ross| And, I love you!! (He walks into the living room)
Mr. Geller| Boy, bad time to say the wrong name, huh Ross?
Ross| Thats true, thanks dad. (To All) People should be dancing! Huh? Hey,
this is a party! Come on! Joey, dance!! (He starts to dance but stops when no one else
joins him.)
Mrs. Waltham| Yes, Waltham interiors.
Phoebe| (On the phone, in New York) Uh, hello, this is Ross Gellers
personal physician, Dr. Philange.
Mrs. Waltham| Who?
Phoebe| Yeah, Ive discovered that Ross forgot to take his brain medicine,
uh, now without it, uh, in the brain of Ross, uh womens names are interchangeable,
through-through no fault of his own.
Mrs. Waltham| Oh my God, Phoebe.
Phoebe| No, not Phoebe, Dr. Philange. Oh no! You have it too!
Phoebe| Hello?
Chandler| Hey.
Monica| Hey.
Chandler| Oh wow, I hope you dont take this the wrong way but, I know we
had plans to meet up tonight and, ugh, Im just kinda worried about what it might do
to our friendship.
Monica| I know. How could we have let this happen?
Chandler| Seven times!
Monica| Ugh! Well, yknow, we were away
Chandler| In a foreign, romantic country
Monica| I blame London.
Chandler| Bad London! (Takes a spoon and smacks the turkey.)
Monica| So look umm, while were st-still in London, I mean, we can keep
doing it right?
Chandler| Well, I dont see that we have a choice. But, when were
back home, we dont do it.
Monica| Only here.
Chandler| Yknow, I saw a wine cellar downstairs
Monica| Ill meet you there in two minutes.
Chandler| Okay!
Rachel| Mon, honey, I gotta ask you something.
Monica| (impatiently) Now?
Rachel| Ross said my name up there, I mean, come on, I just cant pretend
that didnt happen can I?
Monica| Oh, I-I dont know.
Rachel| Monica, what should I do?
Monica| Just uh, do the right thing. (Uses some breath spray)
Rachel| What?
Monica| Toe the line. Thread the needle. Think outside the box! (Tries to leave,
but is stopped by Rachel.)
Rachel| Whoa, wait, listen, I think Im just gonna talk to Ross about what
he think it meant.
Monica| Wait. Rachel, no, hes married. Married! If you dont realize
that, I cant help you.
Rachel| Okay, youre right. Youre right. You cant help me.
Mrs. Geller| Jack, is it all our fault? Were we bad parents?
Mr. Waltham| (walking by) Yes.
Mr. Geller| Oh yeah, well who serves steak when theres no place to sit, I
mean how are you supposed to eat this?
Joey| Hey, whats up? (He has solved the problem of eating the steak,
hes eating it with his hands.)
Monica| Where were you? We were supposed to meet in the wine cellar?
Chandler| Forget it, thats off.
Monica| Why?!
Mr. Waltham| (drunkenly) The next tour of the wine cellar will plan in two in-in
minutes
Monica| Joey, what are you doing? You promised Phoebe you wouldnt eat meat
until she has the babies!
Joey| Well, I figured were in another country, so it doesnt count.
Monica| Thats true.
Chandler| The mans got a point.
Rachel| Oh, hi!
Ross| Hi!
Rachel| Hi. Sorry, things arent working out so well.
Ross| Oh no! It could be better, but its gonna be okay, right?
Rachel| Oh yeah! Of course, I mean, shes gonna get over this, yknow?
I mean, so you said my name! Yknow you just said it cause you saw me there, if
youd have seen a circus freak, you wouldve said, "I take thee circus
freak." Yknow, it didnt mean anything, its just a mistake. It
didnt mean anything. Right?
Ross| No! No! Of course it didnt mean anything! I mean, uh well, I can
understand why Emily would think it meant something, yknow, because-because it was
you
Rachel| Right
Ross| But it absolutely didnt. (Yelling towards the bathroom) It
didnt!! It didnt!!
Joey| (approaching) Ross, hey, the bands ready outside for your first
dance with Emily, so
Ross| (sarcastic) Oh! Oh-oh, the bands ready! Well, I-I-we gotta do what
the band saysI dont care about the stupid band!!
Joey| You spit on me man! (Wipes his face.)
Ross| Look, Im sorry.
Joey| Emily is kinda taking a long time, huh?
Rachel| (laughs) Yknow when I locked myself in the bathroom at my wedding,
it was because I was trying to pop the window out of the frame.
Ross| Oh, right!
Rachel| Get the hell out of there, yknow?
Ross| (Bangs on the bathroom door) Emily? Emily? Im coming in. (He opens
the door to reveal that the window is gone, along with Emily.)
Rachel| Well, look at that, same thing.
[Scene| London Marriott, Monica and Chandler are walking to her room.]
Chandler| Listen, in the middle of everything if I scream the word,
"Yippee!" just ignore me.
Monica| Oh my God, Rachel! Hi!
Chandler| Oh, hello Rachel.
Rachel| Ross said my name. Okay? My name. Ross said my name up there that
obviously means that he still loves me! (They both just stare at her.) Okay, dont
believe me, I know Im rightdo you guys want to go downstairs and get a drink?
Chandler| Yes, we do. But, we have to change first.
Monica| Yes, I want to change. And why-why dont you go down and get us a
table?
Chandler| Yeah, well be down in like five minutes.
Monica| (elbows him) Fifteen minutes.
Rachel| Okay.
Rachel| Hello? Oh, Pheebs! (To them) Its Phoebe!
Chandler| Oh, yay
Monica| Great
Rachel| Hi!
Phoebe| Hi, so what happened?
Rachel| Well, Ross said my name.
Phoebe| Yeah, I know, but I dont think that means anything.
Rachel| Okay, Pheebs, yknow what, lets look at this objectively all
right? Ninth grade, right? The obsession starts. All right? The summer after ninth grade
he sees me in a two-piece for the first time, his obsession begins to grow. So then
Chandler| (To Monica) Hey, listen, why dont we go change in my room?
Monica| But my clothes areohh! (They both leave.)
Chandler| Wow, you look
Monica| No time for that!
Joey| Hey, dude, let me in. I got a girl out here!
Chandler| Well, Ive got a girl in here.
Joey| No you dont, I just saw you go in there with Monica!
Chandler| Well, were-were hanging out in here!
Joey| Look, which one of us is gonna be having sex in there, me or you?
Chandler| Well, I suppose Id have to say you!! But, what if were
watching a movie in here?
Monica| Which we are, and-and we already paid for it. Its My Giant!
Joey| My Giant? I love that movie!
[Scene| Ross and Emilys room, Chandler and Monica are still looking for a place
to do the deed.]
Monica| You really think this is okay?
Chandler| Well, Ross and Emily arent gonna use it.
Monica| Oh, its so beautiful. Ohh! Yknow, I-I dont know if I
feel right about this.
Chandler| Oh Mon-Mon-Mon-Mon-look, this is the honeymoon suite. The room
expects sex. The room would be disappointed if it didnt get sex. All of the
other honeymoon suites would think it was a loser.
Monica| Okay!
Chandler| Okay!
Ross| (entering) Emily?!
Chandler| Nope, not under here!
Monica| You didnt find her?
Ross| No, Ive looked everywhere!
Chandler| Well, you couldnt have looked everywhere or else you
wouldve found her!
Monica| Yeah, I think you should keep looking!
Chandler| Yeah, for about 30 minutes.
Monica| Or 45.
Chandler| Wow, in 45 minutes you can find her twice. (Monica smiles at that.)
Ross| No! For all I know, shes trying to find me but couldnt because
I kept moving around. No, from now on, Im staying in one place. (He sits down on the
bed.) Right here.
Monica| Well, its getting late.
Chandler| Yeah, were gonna go.
Ross| Actually, do you guys mind staying here for a while?
Monica| Ugh, yknow, umm we gotta get up early and catch that plane for New
York.
Chandler| Yeah, its a very large plane.
Ross| (disappointed) Thats cool.
Chandler| But, well stay here with you.
Ross| Thanks guys! (They both sit down on either side of him.) I really
appreciate this, yknow, but you dont have to rub my butt.
[Scene| Ross and Emilys room, the next morning. Ross is now asleep and has his
head in Monicas lap and his feet on Chandlers lap. Monica and Chandler are
both still awake and depressed.]
Chandler| We have to leave for New York in an hour.
Monica| I know, Ive been looking at those doors, they look pretty sound
proof, dont you think?
Chandler| We cant do that thats insane. I mean A he
could wake up and B yknow, lets go for it.
Ross| Em-Emily? (Looking around for her.) Em-Emily? (He runs to the door.)
Emily! (He opens the door to reveal the Walthams standing outside.)
Mr. Waltham| No.
Mrs. Waltham| You can forget about Emily, shes not with us.
Mr. Waltham| Weve come for her things.
Ross| Wait, well wh-wh-wh-where is she?
Mr. Waltham| Shes in hiding. Shes utterly humiliated. She
doesnt want to see you ever again.
Mrs. Waltham| Were very sad that it didnt work out between you and
Emily, monkey. But, I think youre absolutely delicious.
Mr. Waltham| Excuse me, Im standing right here!
Mrs. Waltham| Oh yes, there you are.
Rachel| (entering, carrying an armful of those little soaps.) Hey-hey, you guys
oh hurry up, get some, theres a whole cart outside (Sees the Walthams and
stops.)
Mr. Waltham| Goodbye Geller.
Ross| Now, hold on! Hold on! (Stops him) Look, look, your daughter and I are
supposed to leave tonight for our honeymoon, now-now you-you tell her that Im gonna
be at that airport and I hope that shell be there too! Oh yeah, I said Rachels
name, but it didnt mean anything, Okay? Shes-shes just a friend and
thats all! (Rachel sits down, depressed.) Thats all! Now just tell Emily that
I love her and that I cant imagine spending my life with anyone else. Please,
promise me that youll tell her that.
Mr. Waltham| All right, Ill tell her. (To his wife) Come on bugger face!
Mrs. Waltham| (As she walks pass Ross, she pats his but.) Call me.
Mr. Waltham| You spend half your life in the bathroom, why dont you ever
go out the bloody window!
[Scene| A 747 somewhere over the North Atlantic, Monica and Chandler are sitting in
first class, depressed.]
Monica| Yknow, maybe its best that we never got to do it again.
Chandler| Yeah, it kinda makes that-that one night special. (Realizes something)
Yknow, technically we still are over international waters.
Monica| Im gonna go to the bathroom, maybe Ill see you there in a
bit?
Chandler| Kay!
Joey| Can I ask you something?
Chandler| Uhh, no.
Joey| Felicity and I, were watching My Giant, and I was thinking,
"Im never gonna be as good an actor as that giant." Do you think Im
just wasting my life with this acting thing?
Chandler| No.
Joey| I mean, the giant is like five years younger than me, yknow, you
think Ill ever get there?
Chandler| Yes.
Joey| Thanks man.
Chandler| Okay man. (Chandler starts to get up.)
Joey| But what about how much taller he is than me?
Joey| I mean, theres no way I can make myself taller now, yknow? And
who knows what science will come up with in the future, but Chandler, what if I die an
unsuccessful, regular sized man?
Joey| Hey, Monica, wow youve been in the bathroom for like a half-hour.
Monica| I know!
Joey| Had the beef-tips, huh?
[Scene| Monica and Rachel's, Phoebe is eating cereal from a bowl she has balanced on
her stomach as Joey, Chandler, and Monica return.]
Phoebe| Hey!
Chandler| Hey!
Joey| Hi!
Phoebe| (To Joey) You ate meat! (Joey is shocked) (To Chandler and Monica) You
had sex! (Theyre shocked.)
Chandler| No we didnt!
Phoebe| I know you didnt, I was talking about Monica.
Monica| Phoebe, I did not have sex.
Phoebe| This pregnancy is throwing me all off.
Joey| All right, Im gonna go say hi the chick and the duck.
Phoebe| Oh, me too!
Joey| Why would you need to say hi to them, youve been feeding them for
four days?
Phoebe| Oh right, maybe Ill just go home.
Monica| Well, we certainly are alone.
Chandler| Yes! Good thing we have that, Not in New York rule.
Monica| Right. Umm, listen since were-we-re on that subject, umm, I just
wanted to tell you that uh, well, I-I was going through a really hard time in London, what
with my brother getting married and that guy thinking I was Rosss mother
Chandler| Right.
Monica| Well, an-anyway, I justthat night meant a lot to me, I guess
Im just trying to say thanks.
Chandler| Oh. Yknow, that night meant a lot to me too, and it wasnt
because I was in a bad place or anything, it just meant a lot to me cause,
youre really hot! Is that okay?
Monica| (laughs) Thats okay.
Chandler| And Im cute too.
Monica| And youre cute too.
Chandler| Thank you! (They hug.) All right, I gotta go unpack.
Monica| Okay.
Chandler| Bye.
Chandler| (entering) Im still on London time, does that count?
Monica| That counts!
Chandler| Oh, good! (They start kissing.)
[Scene| An airport in London, Ross is waiting for Emily to show up to go on their
honeymoon and sees Rachel walking past.]
Ross| Rach! Rach!
Rachel| (she stops and turns) Hi!
Ross| Hi! What are you, what are you doing here?
Rachel| Well, I-I-Ive been on Standby for a flight home for hours.
Ross| Oh.
Rachel| Ohh, so no sign of Emily huh?
Ross| Not yet.
Rachel| So umm, what time are you supposed to leave?
Gate Agent| (On the P.A.) This is the last call for Flight 1066 to
Athens. The last call.
Ross| Pretty soon I guess.
Rachel| Yeah. Im sorry.
Ross| I just, I dont understand, I mean, how-how can she do this?
Yknow, what, am I, am I like a complete idiot for thinking that shed actually
show up?
Rachel| No, youre not an idiot, Ross. Youre a guy very much in love.
Ross| Same difference.
Gate Agent| (On the P.A.) All ticketed passengers for Flight 1066 to
Athens should now be on board.
Ross| I get it! Well, thats that.
Rachel| No, you know what, I think you should go.
Ross| What?
Rachel| Yeah, I do. I think you should go, by yourself, get some distance, clear
your head, I think itd be really good.
Ross| Oh, I dont, I dont, I dont know
Rachel| Oh, come on Ross! I think it would be really good for you!
Ross| I could, yeah, I can do that.
Rachel| Yeah.
Ross| I cant, I cant even believe her! No, yknow what, I am, I
am gonna go!
Rachel| Good!
Ross| I know, why not?
Rachel| Right!
Ross| Right?
Rachel| Right!
Ross| Yknowthanks! (They hug)
Rachel| Okay, Ill see you back at home, if I ever get a flight out of
here.
Ross| Yeah, wellnah.
Rachel| What? Wait, what?
Ross| Why dont you come, I mean, I-I have two tickets, why not?
Rachel| Well-well, I dont know Rossreally?
Ross| Yeah, yeah, itll be great! You can, you can lay on the beach and I
can cry over my failed marriage. See-see how I make jokes?
Rachel| Uh-huh.
Ross| No really, I mean, I mean, God, I could use a friend.
Rachel| Oh wow, uh okay, uh maybe. Umm, yes, I can do that!
Ross| Okay!
Rachel| Okay!
Ross| Cool!
Rachel| All right!
Ross| Come on! (They go to the jetway, Ross hands the tickets to the gate
agent.) Here.
Rachel| Oh, okay, were going. Yeah.
Ross| Ah! Ah! I forgot my jacket!
Rachel| Oh, wait-wait-wait
Ross| You tell them to wait!
Rachel| Okay. Wait! Wait!
Ross| Emily.
Ross| Oh no-no-no! Oh-no! (Emily starts to run out and Ross chases her.) No! No!
Emily!
[Scene| Flight 1066 to Athens, Rachel is ordering a drink for Ross and herself.]
Rachel| Ahh, yes, I will have a glass of the Merlot and uh, (points to
Rosss seat.) he will have a white wine spritzer. Woo! (Looks out the window.) Hey,
look at that, the airports moving. (Realizes that thats not how it works.)
Hey, are we moving?! Are we moving? Why are we moving? Hey, time-out, umm, yeah, does the
captain know that were moving? (Sits back in defeat.) Oh my God. Oh, my gosh.
[Scene| Chandler and Joey's Bathroom, Chandler and Monica are sharing a candlelight
bubble bath while drinking champagne and they clink their glasses.]
Monica| You look cute in bubbles.
Chandler| Ehh, you're just liquored up.
Joey| Hey, it's me! I'm comin' in!
Chandler| I've had a very long, hard day.
Joey| Ahh, I'm gonna go get some chicken. Want some?
Chandler| Ahh, no thanks. No chicken, bye-bye then.
Joey| Okay.
Joey| You sure? Some extra crispy? Dirty rice? Beans?
Chandler| For the last time no! Get out! Get out, Joey!
Joey| All right!
Chandler| Are you okay? I'm so sorry, he wouldn't leave. He kept asking me about
chicken.
Monica| Chicken? I could eat some chicken.
Chandler| Hey Joe!
Chandler| Yeah, can I get a 3-piece, some cole slaw, some beans, and a
Coke-(Yelps in
[Scene| Monica and Rachel's, Chandler, Joey, and Monica are eating breakfast.]
Phoebe| (entering) Hey!
Chandler| Hey, Pheebs!
Joey| Mornin' Pheebs!
Phoebe| I have to tell you this story. Okay, I was coming over here and this
driver
Joey| (interrupting) Was his name Angus? (Monica and Chandler laugh.)
Phoebe| What?
Joey| Oh, he was this cab driver we had in London.
Phoebe| Oh. Ha-ha-ha. All right, anyway
Monica| Wait, what that place, that pub he took us too?
Chandler| Uh, The Wheatsheaf.
Joey| Yeah-yeah-yeah, and they had that beer! That uh
Monica| Bodington's!
All| Bodington's! Woohoo! (And they all high-five each other.)
Chandler| Ooh! Ahh, Pheebs, was gonna tell a story.
Phoebe| Yeah, so, he had a really funny hatI don't want to talk about it.
Ross| (entering) Hey!
All| Hey!
Joey| Hey, Ross, Bodington's!
Ross| Yeah! (They high-five.)
Joey| That was good beer.
Ross| Ohh
Joey| Y'know, I'd walk back to London for another frosty one of those bad
boys.
Ross| Y'know, I think they have those at that British pub near the trade center.
Joey| Later! (Exits.)
Ross| Isn't Rachel supposed to be back by now?
Monica| Yeah, but her plane got delayed in Athens. But actually, (Checks watch)
she should be here by now.
Ross| Oh, so-so you talked to her. Did she, did she sound mad?
Monica| No, but she likes me. You abandoned her on a plane to Greece.
Ross| Okay, I did not abandon Rachel! Okay? Emily showed up at the
airport! I had to go after her! I mean, I-I did what I had to do! She's my wife!
Rachel is my wife! Y'knowEmily! Emily, is my wife! Man, what is that?
Phoebe| So you still hadn't heard from Emily?
Ross| No, not since I lost her at the airport.
Chandler| I can't believe she can out run you man!
Ross| HEY, SHE'S FAST!! OKAY?!! (Chandler is so shocked at Ross's
outburst that he drops his spoon and backs up) Oh! You-you think you can be beat
me? Let's go! Outside!!
Rachel| (entering) Hi!
All| Hey! (They all go hug her, except for Ross.)
Ross| Rach, Rach, I am so sorry. I am so-so sorry.
Rachel| Oh Ross, come on! You just did what you had to do.
Ross| That's it? You're not mad? I mean, it must've been terrible.
Rachel| Terrible? Hell, I was in Greece! That was a nice hotel! Nice beach, met
the nice people. Not to shabby for Rachel. (Goes and puts her luggage away.)
Ross| So, what? That's it?
Rachel| Well, yeah! We're cool. Totally cool.
Ross| Oh, thanks. Oh, you're the best. (They hug.)
Rachel| Oh no, you're the best.
Ross| (breaking the hug) Ohh, I gotta go to the flower store! (Runs to the
door.) Check it out, no one will tell me where Emily is, so I'm gonna send 72 long-stem,
red roses to Emily's parent's house, one for each day that I've known and loved her. That
oughta get her talking to me again.
Chandler| Oh, Ross, when you make out card; be sure to make it out to, EM-I-LY.
Monica| Rach, that's great! It's so good that you had a good time in Greece!
Rachel| What?! I didn't have a good time in Greece! Ross abandoned me! Okay, I
couldn't get a plane out, so I had to stay in their honeymoon suite with people coming up
to me all the time going, "Oh, Mrs. Geller, why are you crying?" I mean, it was
sooo humiliating. I felt like such an idiot! I mean, it's all my fault! And you know why,
because I make very bad decisions.
Chandler| Oh that's not true.
Rachel| Yes it is! It is true! I went, I went after Ross in stupid London.
Phoebe| London is stupid! Stupid!
Rachel| Phoebe, you were right. I should've never gone to London, and from now
on you make all of my decisions for me.
Phoebe| Oh No, I did that for someone once and I'm not comfortable having
that kind of power and control over someone's life.
Monica| I'll do it!
Rachel| That's fine. So Monica, you are now in control of my love life.
Chandler| Okay, I gotta go to work.
Chandler| And uh, Rachel, glad to have you back.
Chandler| Pheebs! (He goes over and kisses Phoebe, who is also stunned.) Always
a pleasure. (And he struts out leaving the girls to stare at each other.)
[Scene| Central Perk, Monica, Rachel, Chandler and Joey are there looking at pictures
from the trip to London.]
Monica| Oh, Rachel, sweetie, look, here's a really cute picture of Joey and you
at the reception.
Rachel| Ohh, he's married! Ross is married. I can'tI still can't believe
it. (Rachel grabs the picture from Monica)
Monica| Honey, sweetie, by the edges.
Rachel| I mean, y'know I'm just gonna have to accept it (She grabs the rest of
the pictures)
Monica| Ohh. (Monica covers her eyes in horror.)
Rachel| I mean it's my fault.
Monica| Sweetie! Edges! Fingers! Smudgey! Pictures!
Rachel| Oh my God! (She licks the top picture and hands them back.)
Monica| Okay. That's okay. I-I know that you're very upset right now. I know, I
know that wasn't about me.
Joey| (To Chandler) I bet it was about her a little.
Monica| If you would stop thinking about Ross for one minute you would notice
that there are great guys everywhere! I mean, look! Look, Gunther! (Gunther turns to
listen in.) I mean, he's nice, he's cute.
Rachel| Yeah, I guess Gunther is kinda
Monica| (Interrupting) Oh, what about that guy over there? (She points at
another guy and Gunther is deflated.) Remember? That is the guy you flirted with at
the counter that time.
Rachel| Oh, I don't know. I don't know.
Monica| You're going to talk to him! Y'know what? We made a deal, I make your
decisions and I say you're going to talk to him.
Rachel| All right, you're the boss. I guess I gotta do what you tell me.
Joey| Say that to him and you're golden. (She just glares at him.)
Phoebe| (entering) Hey!
Rachel| Hey!
Joey| Hey, Pheebs!
Monica| We got out pictures back from London. (Shows her one.) Here's all of us
at the Tower of London.
Phoebe| (Grabs the pictures) Oh! Here we all are! Yeah, there's Ross and
Joey and you and me. (She picks up a magic marker and draws herself in. Monica can't
watch.)
Chandler| All right, y'know what, we've been talking about London too much
haven't we?
Phoebe| No. I'm sorry. It's just 'cause I couldn't be there. 'Cause all I ever
get to do now is pregnant stuff, it just bums me out.
All| Sorry.
Monica| What happened?
Rachel| Well, y'know, a little of this, a little of that. Got myself a date
tomorrow night.
Monica| See, didn't I tell you?! You're getting over Ross already!
Rachel| Well
Gunther| (To the guy) Get out!
[Scene| Monica and Rachel's, Chandler enters to find Monica waiting patiently for him.
He closes the door and they start kissing.]
Monica| What took you so long?
Chandler| I got caught up and work, but I'm quitting tomorrow.
Monica| Oh, good.
Chandler| So, thanks for having me over! Rach. (Goes over, grabs her, and kisses
her.) Pheebs. (After a moment while he decides how to kiss her around her belly, grabs her
and kisses her.)
Joey| (Jumping out of his way) See ya!! (To the girls.) What the hell was that?!
Monica| Probably some y'know, European good-bye thing he picked up in London.
Rachel| That's not European!
Phoebe| Well, it felt French.
[Scene| The hallway between the apartments, Rachel is returning from her date with
Dave.]
Rachel| Oh God, I really had a good time!
Dave| Yeah, me too. (They reach her door.) So, I guess this is it.
Rachel| Yeah. Umm, unless you wanna come inside?
Dave| Yeah!
Rachel| Okay. Oh, uh, wait a minute, y'know what? I uh, I can't decide this.
Umm, okay, just hold on a second.
Dave| Okay, yeah!
Rachel| Umm, hi!
Ross| Hi.
Rachel| Is Monica around? I-I have to ask her something.
Ross| She's doing her laundry.
Rachel| What's that? (Points to the box.)
Ross| It came in the mail today, it's uh, 72 long-stemmed red roses, one for
each day that I've known and loved Emily, cut up into mulch!
Rachel| Oh, honey that's awful.
Ross| Oh, it's not so bad. Monica's gonna make potpourri! I think I'm gonna go
wander out in the rain for a while.
Rachel| But, it's not raining.
Ross| I can't catch a break!
Rachel| Y'know what Ross? You're not going anywhere. You're gonna sit right
here. I'm gonna make you a cup of tea and we're gonna talk this thing whole out. All
right? (She goes out to talk to Dave) Hey, Dave!
Dave| Yeah?
Rachel| Umm, listen, I'm gonna need to take a rain check, my roommate is just
really sick. Okay? Bye! (She goes back in to talk to Ross.) Honey, listen, I know, I know
things seem so bad right now.
Monica| (Poking her head in) Rach? Can I talk to for just a minute? I-I dropped
some socks.
Rachel| Yeah. (She goes out to join her in the hall and starts looking for the
dropped socks.)
Monica| What is the matter with you?! Do you want to fall into the trap? Do you
want to fall into the trap?!
Rachel| Ohh! You did not drop any socks!
Monica| I just ran into Dave and he told me that you blew him off! I mean, you
listen to me! Now, I'm calling the shots! I say you leave Ross alone and go get Dave! What
the hell were you trying to do?
Rachel| Well, ultimately, I was trying y'know, I-I wantedtell him y'know,
that I'm still in love with him.
Monica| (Gasps) What?!! You cannot tell him that!!
Rachel| Why? Why not?! People love to hear that!
Monica| I make the decisions, and I say no.
Rachel| Well, y'know what, no, you do not make my decisions because y'know what,
you're fired.
Monica| You can't fire me. I make your decisions and I say,
"I'm not fired!" Ha!
Rachel| Well (At a loss for words, she grabs some of Monica's laundry and
throws it on the floor as a diversion to allow Rachel to run back inside and close the
door. Monica chases her to find that Rachel had locked the door.)
Monica| Rachel!! Come on! Let me in!
Joey| (Poking his head out.) Havin' some trouble?
Monica| Rachel locked the door.
Joey| I'll kick that door in if you give me a little sugar.
[Scene| The hallway, continued from earlier. Monica is still locked out.]
Monica| Rachel! Let me in! Rachel!
Monica| Thank you. Rachel, can I talk to you outside for a sec?
Rachel| No.
Monica| I really need to talk to you.
Rachel| Well, then talk!
Monica| Okay, I will. Remember that thing that we just discussed that you wanted
to do?
Rachel| Yes!
Ross| What thing?
Monica| Well, Rachel wants to take swing dance lessons. Which I think is a
really stupid idea! It's dangerous, she's never gonna get what she wants, and who knows
who she might (Turns to look at Ross) end up hurting.
Ross| Monica's right, swing dancing can be tricky. I'm gonna use the phone. I
gotta cancel those five giant teddy bears I sent to Emily. (Looks at the rose mulch.) My
God, think of the massacre.
Rachel| I'm gonna do it.
Monica| All right, Rachel, I know-I know you think I'm crazy, please, before you
tell him you love him, just-just try to find one person who thinks this is a good idea.
Because I bet you, you can't.
Rachel| But I
Monica| Please!
Rachel| All right, fine.
Monica| Joey, I'm in!
Joey| (In tremendous pain) All right. Good deal.
[Scene| Central Perk, Joey, Chandler, Monica, and Rachel are there as Phoebe enters.]
All| Pheebs! Hey Pheebs!
Joey| Uh, okay, Pheebs?
Phoebe| Yeah?
Joey| Umm, y'know how the other day you were talking about how you didn't get to
go to London and how you were kinda feeling left out?
Phoebe| Yeah?
Joey| All right, well, we felt really bad about that so we decided we should all
take a little trip together!
Phoebe| Ohh, that's so nice! How great! Well, where? Where's the trip?!
Monica| Well, we thought we would all go to a picnic (Phoebe gasps), in Central
Park!
Phoebe| (excited) Central(not so excited) Park!
Joey| Yeah, all of us! All day!
Phoebe| That sucks! That's not a trip! I just came from the park! What are we
gonna high five about at the stupid Central Park? "Well, it's right by my house, all
right!"
Chandler| Well, I'm gonna go home and bask in the triumph of my Central Park
idea. (Gets up to leave.)
Rachel| (stopping him) Hey-whoa-whoa-whoa!! Ho-ho-hold on a sec there, Mr.
Kissey! Y'know, I've been meaning to talk to you about this whole, little, new European
thing you got going on, and I just need to tell you that it makes me very uncomfortable
and I justy'knowstop it!
Chandler| I was just trying to bring a little culture to the group.
Phoebe| That's fine, just don't bring it in my mouth.
Monica| Makes me wanna puke! (Chandler looks at her, quizzically.)
[Scene| Central Perk, Rachel, Monica, Chandler, and Joey are there as Ross enters with
Phoebe.]
Ross| Hey everybody, Pheebs is here!
Joey| Phoebe!
Chandler| Hey, Pheebs!
Rachel| Phoebe, woo!
Phoebe| Okay, woo! Hi.
Chandler| Okay, Pheebs, we decided the picnic idea was a little Y'know, it
didn't have any It-it, well it blew. So, we thought, that this afternoon that we
would all go away for the whole weekend to, Atlantic City!
Phoebe| Ooh, Atlantic City! Oh, that's a great plan! Who's plan was that?
Joey| Mine!
Ross| Wait! It was my plan.
Joey| Nooo, I said we needed a new plan.
Ross| And, I came up with Atlantic City.
Joey| Which, is the new plan!
Monica| Okay, well, why don't we all meet upstairs in an hour?
Phoebe| Okay! Ooh-ahh, I'm gonna go pack. I'm gonna go pack my ass off!
Monica| Come on Rach, let's go.
Rachel| Yeah, y'know what? I'm-I'm gonna meet you upstairs in a minute.
Monica| No! Rachel, you didn't find anyone so you can't tell him.
Rachel| Well, y'know what, that doesn't matter.
Monica| Okay, Rachel, do you have any idea how painful it is to tell someone
that you love them and not have them say it back?
Rachel| Yeah, I-I don't care.
Monica| Okay. I-I can't watch. (Leaves as sits down to read the paper.)
Rachel| What 'cha readin'?
Ross| The paper.
Rachel| Yeah, what's it about?
Ross| Events from around the globe.
Rachel| Okay. Uhh, Ross, y'know what, there's something that I-that I have to
talk to you about and everybody's saying that I shouldn't tell you, but I think they're
wrong. I mean, and you know how people can be wrong.
Ross| Sure. Once, at work I-I thought carbon dating was fossilized
Rachel| Okay, Ross, I'm really trying to tell you something here.
Ross| Yeah.
Rachel| Okay.
Ross| Go ahead.
Rachel| Umm, okay, I think I'm-I'm just gonna-just gonna say it. Just gonna say
it. Uhh, (pause) I'm still in love with you Ross.
Ross| Wow. Umm Huh I'm-I'm not sure what to do with that right now.
Ross| What? What? Was that a joke? 'Cause it's mean.
Rachel| (Laughing) I'm so dead serious. I'm totally serious.
Ross| Why are you laughing?
Rachel| Because (laughs), because, I just heard it. I heard it, and it's
ridiculous! I mean, you're married. You're-you're married and it's just ridiculous, and
it's like, it's like when said it, I sort of like, I floated up out of my body, y'know?
And, and-and then I heard myself say it and then the floating Rachel (laughs) was like,
"You are such an idiot!"
Ross| Well, well I am married. Even though I haven't spoken to my wife
since the wedding.
Rachel| (laughs) I'm sorry, that's not funny.
Ross| Actually, it kinda is. My wife won't return my calls. I don't know where
my wife is. (Laughs) "Hey Ross, where's the Mrs.?" Don't know!
Rachel| Oh God, ohh, okay, y'know what, do you think ah, do you think that you
just forget that I told you this?
Ross| Well, I kinda half to. I mean, because the thing is
Rachel| The thing is y'know, that you're married to Emily.
Ross| That is what the thing is.
Rachel| Ross, things aren't gonna be weird between us, right? I mean was that
just the stupidest thing, me telling you that?
Ross| No. No. No, I'm-I'm glad you did. Look, if nothing else, it's-it's always
great when someone tells you they love you.
Rachel| That's what I said! Thank you for being so nice. (They hug.)
Ross| No thank you for Thank you.
[Scene| Monica and Rachel's, the gang is about ready to leave for Atlantic City.]
Ross| Okay, let's go!
Chandler| Atlantic City!
Phoebe| Atlantic City, baby! Let's roll some bones! Hey Joey, high-five for
rolling bones!
Joey| Uh, Pheebs, you're leaking?
Monica| Oh my God! You're water broke!
The Guys| Ohh!
Phoebe| All right. Well, don't worry, I call shotgun! (She starts out the door.)
All| Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa! Wait-wait!
Chandler| Pheebs! We have to take you to the hospital now!
Ross| Pheebs, Pheebs, the babies are coming now.
Rachel| High-five, the babies are coming! (They all high-five.)
Phoebe| Wait, wait, remember when my water broke? (They all high-five again.)
[Scene| The hallway between the apartments, they are taking Phoebe to the hospital but
Chandler and Monica hold back.]
Monica| I can't believe Phoebe's gonna have her babies!
Chandler| I know, it's beautiful. Amazing.
Chandler| Y'know what else I can't believe? I had to kiss Phoebe and Rachel
every time I left a room, I mean it's too bad they didn't see us having sex.
Monica| Do you know anything about women?
Chandler| No.
Monica| That's all right.
Chandler| Okay. (They kiss again.)
[Scene| The Hospital, Phoebe is arriving with Ross, Joey, and Rachel in tow.]
Phoebe| (to the nurse) Hi.
Nurse| Hi.
Phoebe| Hi, yeah, hi! I'm umm, Phoebe Buffay, and I have babies coming out of
me.
Nurse| Okay. Have you started having contractions?
Phoebe| Not yet. Umm, I heard they really hurt, do they hurt?
Nurse| Well
Phoebe| Oh my God!
Ross| It's all right.
Nurse| Now, which of you is the father? (Points to Joey and Ross)
Phoebe| Oh no, none of them are the father. The father is my brother.
Nurse| (not sure what to do with that) Okay
Rachel| I am so gonna miss watching you freak people out like that!
Joey| Okay, uh Pheebs, quick. Look! This (His video camera) is for the babies to
look at someday, so is-is there anything you want to say? Y'know before it all starts?
Phoebe| Oh, okay, umm, hi kids! Um, it's me, Aunt Phoebe. I can't wait to see
you. Please don't hurt me!
Ross| Hey, what took you guys so long? Your cab left when ours did!
Monica| Well, we-we had to go back because I forget my jacket.
Chandler| That's right.
Rachel| You-you're not wearing a jacket.
Monica| Oh man! I did it again!
Phoebe| (standing up) Okay, so umm, somebody has to call Frank and Alice. (As
she is talking Joey is sticking the camera under her skirt.) And then my mom wants to
know-(notices Joey)-Joey, what are you doing?!
Joey| I gotta get the before shot!
[Scene| The delivery room, Rachel and Ross are entering.]
Rachel| Hi, Pheebs? Okay, so just spoke to the nurse and the reason that your
doctor is late is because uh, she's not coming.
Phoebe| What?!
Ross| Apparently she fell in the shower and hit her head.
Phoebe| Oh my God, she's so stupid!
Ross| Look, Pheebs-Pheebs, it's gonna be okay.
Phoebe| That's easy for you to say, I don't see three kids coming out your
vagina!
Rachel| Honey, listen, y'know what? The nurse said the doctor is wonderful.
Ross| Yeah, he's head of the department.
Phoebe| All rightOoh! Oh dead God, save me!
Monica| What?
Phoebe| I'm having my first contraction!
Chandler| Oh no.
Phoebe| Ooh, it's not bad.
Chandler| Okay.
Joey| Oh! (In an announcer type voice) And so the miracle of life begins, and
aaiiyyyeeee! (He grabs his side and doubles over in pain.)
Chandler| Hey! You okay?
Joey| Ooh, something hurts!
Phoebe| Ooh, it's sympathy pains. Ohh, that's so sweet!
Joey| Are they? I didn't know I cared that much.
Ross| Hello.
Dr. Harad| Hi! Phoebe, I'm Dr. Harad, I'm going to be delivering your babies. I
want you to know, you're gonna be in good hands. I've been doing this for a long time.
I'll be back in a minute to do your internal, in the meantime, just relax because
everything here looks great. And also, I love Fonzie. (Exits)
Chandler| Did he just say, he loves Fonzie?
Monica| That's what it sounded like.
Chandler| All right
Frank| (entering) Hey!
All| Hey!
Frank| (To Phoebe) Hey! Am I late? Am I late? Nobody came out yet, right?
Phoebe| No-no-no! We haven't started yet. Where's Alice?
Frank| Uh, Delaware. She's on her way though, so until she gets here, I'm gonna
be your coach. But don't worry, she told me all about the la-Mazada stuff.
Chandler| Yeah, that's when if you get the babies out by the end of the month,
they give you 2% financing.
Frank| Yeah.
[Scene| The waiting room, Monica and Joey are sitting there.]
Rachel| (entering) Monica? You gonna be very proud of me. I just got us dates
with two unbelievably cute nurses.
Joey| Oh my!
Rachel| They're male nurses.
Joey| Not in my head.
Rachel| Anyway, they want to take us out Saturday night! What do you say?
Monica| Umm. (Looks at Chandler who is using the phone.) Umm. Umm. I don't think
so.
Rachel| What? What are you talking about?! You-you're the one who's been telling
me to get over Ross and move on. I'm moving on, and you're moving on with me. Come on,
give me one good reason why you don't wanna go.
Monica| Umm, why don't you give me something that would be a good reason
and-and then I'll tell you if it's true.
Rachel| What?
Monica| Harder than it sounds. Isn't it?
Rachel| Okay, you're coming with me, and I also told them that if we're still
here when they get off that we'll go down to the cafeteria and have some Jell-O
with them.
Joey| (in a sexy voice) Yep! There's always room for Jell-O
Rachel| Joey, how do you make that dirty?
Joey| Oh, it's easy. Yeah, I-I can do it with anything. Watch uh, (snaps his
fingers and in a sexy voice) Grandma's chicken salad
[Scene| The delivery room, Chandler, Frank, and Ross are with Phoebe.]
Joey| (entering) Ross! Get a shot of this. (He's carrying an issue of the USA
Today and hands Ross the camera.) Hey babies! These are the headlines on the day you
were born! Okay, now girl baby turn away and boy babies (Throws the paper away to
reveal a copy of Playpen, which is the TV version of Playboy Magazine.) Check it
out, huh?! This is what naked women looked like the month you were born. All right, now
let's dive right into the good stuff. (Joey opens the magazine and Ross sticks the camera
in it.)
Phoebe| Oh, okay, I'm having another one! This one doesn't hurt eitherOoh,
yes it does! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ooh! (Checks under the blanket.) Oh, I was kinda hoping that
was it.
Ross| Hey, where are Monica and Rachel anyway?
Joey| Oh, a couple of nurses asked them out. Maybe they're with them.
Chandler| Really? Male nurses?
Joey| Yeah, I was bummed too.
Chandler| So they're going on dates? When?
Joey| I think Saturday(groans in pain again).
Frank| (To Phoebe) What's with him?
Phoebe| Umm, sympathy pains. I thought it was really sweet at first, but now I
think he's just trying to steal my thunder.
Dr. Harad| (entering) Okay!
Phoebe| Hey.
Dr. Harad| Let's see what we got here. Ohh, y'know, Fonzie dated triplets.
Chandler| This-this Fonzie person you keep referring too, is that uh, is that
another doctor?
Dr. Harad| Oh no-no-no. Fonzie is the nickname of Arthur Fonzerelli. The Fonz.
Chandler| All right.
Frank| It's not that weird, is it?
Phoebe| It's very weird! I don't want some guy down there telling me, I'm
y'know, dilatedamundo!
Ross| To be fair, he doesnt seem to be impersonating Fonzie
Phoebe| (interrupting) What are you doing?!! Why are you defending him?! Just
get me another doctor! One who is not crazy and who is not Fonzie!
Ross| Again, it's not that he
[Scene| The waiting room, Chandler is looking for Monica.]
Chandler| (spotting her) Oh-hey-hey-hey! There you are!
Monica| Umm, listen there's something I think you should know.
Chandler| Oh, is this about you-you dating the nurse? Yeah, Joey already told
me, and I am so-so fine. I mean, you and I we're just, y'know, we're nothing, we're
goofin' around.
Monica| Umm, actually I was about to tell you that I was, I was going to get out
of it, but hey, if we're just goofing around then uh, maybe I will go out with him.
Chandler| Fine! Maybe I will too!
Joey| (entering from the elevator caring gifts for the kids) Hey, you guys! Look
what I found in the giiiiiiift shop. (He doubles over in pain in front an old man in a
wheel chair.) Get up! Get up! Get up! (The old man waves him away.)
[Scene| The delivery room, Ross has returned with another doctor. This one, is well,
younger.]
Ross| Okay, Phoebe, this Dr. Oberman. He has no strong feelings about Fonzie or
any of the Happy Days gang.
Phoebe| Hi! And you're going into what grade?
Dr. Oberman| Umm, I'm actually a first year resident, but I get that a lot, you
see, I-I graduated early
Phoebe| (interrupting) Uh-huh, me too. Ross, maybe I should've specified that
I'd be needing a grown up doctor.
Dr. Oberman| Oh no, I'm fully qualified to
Phoebe| Shh! Doogie, shh! Doesn't anybody understand that I'm gonna be having
babies soon? Huh? Go! Go little boy, go!
Frank| Oh cool! You made him cry!
[Scene| Another hospital room, Joey has now been admitted and his doctor is about to
break the bad news to him, Monica, and Chandler.]
Joey's Doctor| Mr. Tribbiani, I'm afraid you've got kidney stones.
Joey| Umm, well, what else could it be?
Joey's Doctor| It's kidney stones.
Joey| Or?
Joey's Doctor| Kidney stones!
[Scene| The delivery room, Dr. Harad is back and checking on Phoebe.]
Dr. Harad| All right, you're getting there. Oh, and y'know, these babies are
very, very lucky.
Phoebe| They are. Why?
Dr. Harad| They have the honor of being born on The Fonz's half-birthday.
Phoebe| Happy birthday!
Dr. Harad| Just-just to clarify, I'm not Fonzie. (Phoebe nods in agreement as he
leaves.)
Rachel| Honey, y'know I just gotta tell you, I think this is such a terrific
thing you're having these babies for Frank and Alice.
Phoebe| I know, it is.
Rachel| Yeah!
Phoebe| Can I tell you a little secret?
Rachel| Yeah!
Phoebe| I want to keep one. (Giggles in excitement.)
Rachel| Ohh, I'm gonna be on the news!
[Scene| The delivery room, continued from earlier.]
Rachel| Okay, Phoebe, honey, you gotta be kidding. I mean, you know you
cannot keep one of these babies!
Phoebe| Why not?! Maybe I can, you don't know!
Rachel| Yes! Yes! Yes, I do! I do know! Frank and Alice are gonna want to keep all
of their children!
Phoebe| Maybe not! Y'know? Seriously, three babies are a handful maybe they're
y'know, looking for a chance to unload one of them. Listen, I-I hate to miss an
opportunity just because I didn't ask! Y'know?
Rachel| Phoebe, no! This is, this is insane.
Phoebe| Oh, just ask him!
Rachel| Me?!
Phoebe| I can't ask him! Do you have any idea how inappropriate that
would be?! All I'm saying is just talk to Frank. Okay? Just, y'know, feel him out!
Rachel| No! Forget it! I am not gonna ask Frank to give you one of his
kids!!
Phoebe| You're right.
Phoebe| Tell him it's for you.
[Scene| Joey's room, his doctor, Chandler, and Monica are there.]
Monica| Feeling a little better sweetie?
Joey| Well, maybe a little. I wish you hadn't seen me throw up.
Monica| Me too.
Ross| (entering) Hey! I just heard. What's up?
Joey's Doctor| Kidney stones! Now, ordinarily Mr. Tribbiani, we try to break up
the stones up with shock waves, but they're to close to the bladder now. Which means we
can either wait for you to pass them or else go up the urethra
Joey| (interrupting) Whoa-whoa! No-no-no-no-no, nothing is going up! Okay? Up,
up is not an optionwhat's a urethra? (Monica whispers what it is in his ear.) Are
you crazy?!
[Scene| The delivery room, Rachel and Frank are there.]
Phoebe| (To Rachel) So did you ask him?
Rachel| No, I haven't had a chance to be alone with him yet.
Phoebe| Well, I'm kinda on a clock here.
Dr. Harad| (laughing) Oh Fonzie.
Rachel| Y'know who I always liked? Mork.
Phoebe| Undo it. Undo it. Undo it.
Dr. Harad| Fonzie met Mork. Mork froze Fonzie.
Rachel| Yeah, but umm Yes, but, Fonzie was already cool, so he wasn't
hurt, right?
Dr. Harad| Yeah, that's right.
Monica| (entering with Chandler) Hey!
Phoebe| Hi!
Monica| (To Phoebe) How are you doing?
Phoebe| Okay, doctor says any minute now.
Frank| Hey, y'know, Alice is gonna be here so soon, you couldn't just like do me
a favor and like, like hold them in?
Phoebe| Sorry Frank, I'm kinda in the middle of the last favor you asked me to
do.
Male Nurse| Hey!
Rachel| Hi!
Male Nurse| Rachel.
Rachel| Monica, this is Dan (points to him), one of the guys that we're gonna be
going out with on Saturday. (Mouths "He's yours." to her.) Uh Dan, Monica.
Dan| Nice to meet you.
Monica| Hello Dan! I'm really looking forward to Saturday night! Really,
really!
Chandler| So Dan, nurse not a doctor huh? Kinda girlie isn't it?
Monica| Chandler!
Dan| Nah that's okay. I'm just doing this to put myself through medical school.
Chandler| Oh.
Dan| And it didn't feel so girlie during the Gulf War.
Chandler| Sure. (Pause) And listen, thanks for doing that for us, by the way.
(Retreats in defeat.)
Monica| So, why wait 'til Saturday, are you free tomorrow?
Dan| Sure! I'll get somebody to cover my shift.
Monica| Oh, great!
Chandler| (to another female nurse) Hey, how 'bout it? You, me, Saturday night?
Delivery Room Nurse| No.
Chandler| All right. Very good.
Phoebe| Oo, this is a big one. Eww! Arghhhh!!
Joey| Ohh, get these things out of me!
Ross| Breathe! Breathe! Breathe throw the pain.
Joey| I want the drugs Ross, I want the drugs! (He starts rocking back and
forth, taking Ross with him.)
Ross| I do too! I do too!
Joey| Argh!
Ross| Argh!
Joey| Argh!
Ross| Argh!
[Scene| The waiting room, Frank is on the phone as Rachel approaches.]
Frank| Yeah, I love you. Okay, bye! (To Rachel) Hi!
Rachel| Hi!
Frank| That was Alice's mom, she said she left five hours ago. She should be
here by now!
Rachel| Oh, honey, dont worry. She's gonna make it on time.
Frank| Yeah.
Rachel| Yeah. So Frank, three babies. Whew, that just seems like a lot, huh?
Frank| (laughs) Not to me.
Rachel| Yeah, fair enough.
[Scene| The delivery room, later on, Rachel, Chandler, Monica, and Frank are there as
Dr. Harad is checking out Phoebe.]
Dr. Harad| Okay, you're at ten centimeters. Time to start having some babies.
All right, I want only the father in here please.
Monica| Bye Dan!
Dan| Uh, bye Monica.
Chandler| Bye, momi-moo.
Dr. Harad| All right, I need a clamp, sterile towel, and channel 31.
Phoebe| What is that?
Phoebe| Oh my God!
Dr. Harad| Oh, no-no-no, it's a good one! Fonzie plays the bongos. All right,
are you ready? It's time to start pushing.
Joey's Doctor| Are you ready? It's time to try peeing. (Joey makes a face like
he is trying to pee.) Wait-wait-wait-wait-wait! It's almost time to try peeing.
(Points at the bottle Joey is to pee into.)
Dr. Harad| Okay, now push! That's it push! Just concentrate on pushing! Yeah,
here we go!
Dan| I see the head.
Frank| Yes, it has a head!
Dr. Harad| All right. Keep pushing! Come on!
Frank| I can't believe there's somebody coming out of you right now. There's
somebody coming out of you! Is it? Is it? It's my son.
Dr. Harad| All right. Here's your first baby.
Frank| YESSSSS!!!!! We got a baby boy!!
Chandler| Yes!
Frank| Frank Jr. Jr.!!
Rachel| Oh, how does he look? How does he look?
Frank| So gross! (He runs back to the delivery room.)
Dr. Harad| Okay. You ready to push again?
Phoebe| I already had a baby. Leave me alone.
Frank| Okay, okay, come on, you can do it. You can do it!
Frank| Yeah!! Little Leslie is here! We got another one! Oh my God, I can't
believe I have two-two children. How scary is that? (He returns to the delivery room.)
Frank| Come on little Chandler, it's time to be born. Come on little Chandler!
Come on!
Dr. Harad| All right, he's coming. He's coming!
Frank| Hey, where's his thing?
Frank| Chandler's a girl!
Chandler| Oh God, kindergarten flashback.
Frank| They musta read the sonogram wrong. 'Cause they, 'cause they thought it
was a boy, but Chandler's a girl! Chandler's a girl!
Chandler| Okay, keep saying it!
Alice| (running in from the elevator) Am I too late?!
Frank| No-no ah, everything's okay. Everybody's healthy there's 30 fingers and
30 toes.
Alice| We have our babies?
Frank| Yeah.
Alice| (Starting to cry) Oh, we have our babies.
[Scene| Joey's room, he is recovering from his birth.]
Joey| Oh my God.
Ross| You did it, man.
Joey's Doctor| Would you like to see them? (He hands Joey a little jar.)
Joey| They're so small! (Both he and Ross look at them with satisfied looks on
their faces.)
[Scene| A hallway, Monica and Dan are talking.]
Dan| So, I'll call you tomorrow.
Monica| Great!
Chandler| So, are you really gonna go out with that nurse man?
Monica| Well uh, you and I are just goofing around, I thought, why not goof
around with him.
Chandler| Y'know, I don't know if you've ever looked up the term goofing around
in the dictionary Well, I have, and the technical definition is, two friends who
care a lot about each other and have amazing sex and just wanna spend more time together.
But if you have this new fangled dictionary that gets you made at me, then we have to,
y'know, get you my original dictionary. I am so bad at this.
Monica| I think you're better than you think you are.
Chandler| Really? Okay, so
Monica| (interrupting) Know when to stop.
Chandler| Y'know, I sensed that I should stop. So we're okay?
Monica| Yeah. All right, I'm gonna go tell Dan that it's not gonna happen. (They
kiss and as she starts to leave, Chandler starts to dance. Without turning around.) Don't
do the dance.
Chandler| Right!
[Scene| The delivery room, everyone except Rachel is there. Phoebe, Monica, and Ross
are holding the babies.]
Monica| I think you're my favorite.
Phoebe| Which one do you have?
Monica| I don't care.
Rachel| (entering) Hi. (To Phoebe) Hey, hi! So uh, Frank and Alice wanted me to
tell you that they're still outside making phone calls.
Phoebe| But umm, I mean, did you talk to them about, y'know
Rachel| Yeah, umm, no honey.
Phoebe| Oh. It was a long shot. Hey, you guys can I just like have a second
alone with the babies.
All| Yeah, sure yeah. Yeah.
Phoebe| So, here you are. It seems like yesterday I was talking to you in that
little petri dish. Everyone said labor was the hardest thing I'd ever have to do, but they
were wrong this is. Oh, I had the most fun with you guys! I wish I could take you home and
see you everyday. Okay, I'll settle for being your favorite Aunt. I know Alice's sister
has a pool, but you lived in me. Okay, so we're cool. Yeah, we're gonna be great. Little
high fives! (Imitates the high fives.) Ahh! Ahh! Ahh! (One of the babies begins to cry.)
Well, if you're gonna cry. (She starts crying.)
[Scene| The delivery room, everyone is hanging out with Phoebe. Frank, Alice, and the
kids aren't there.]
Monica| Phoebe, we are so proud of you! You're amazing!
Phoebe| I know.
Rachel| So does it really hurt as bad as they say?
Phoebe| Yeah. You won't be able to take it.
Chandler| So uh, now that little Chandler turned out to be a girl, what are they
gonna name her?
Phoebe| They're gonna call her Chandler.
Chandler| That's kind of a masculine name, don't you think?
Phoebe| Works on you.
[Scene| Monica and Rachel's, Rachel has just gotten home and is going through the mail.
She finds something that's Monica's and goes over and knocks on her closed bedroom door.]
Monica| (In a sexy voice) Come in. I've been waiting for you.
Rachel| Hi! I just wanna-(sees Monica)-Ahhh!!! Oh my God! (She runs out in
horror.) Oh my God!
Monica| (pulling on a robe) Okay, I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I-I-I was um, I was
taking a nap.
Rachel| Since when do take naps in that position. Oh God Monica, tell me
you were waiting for a guy! Please tell me you were waiting for a guy!
Monica| Yes. Yes, I was. A guy. From work. (Thinks) I'm seeing a guy from work!
Ha!
Rachel| (Gasps) That cute waiter guy from your restaurant, the one that looks
like a non-threatening Ray Liotta?
Monica| Uh-huh, that one!
Rachel| Y'know what, just give me a second and I'll be out of your hair. I'm
just gonna grab a jacket. When I get back, I want every little detail. (There's a knock on
the door.) Maybe that's him. (Goes to answer the door.)
Monica| (Panicking) Okay, umm, okay, umm (Rachel opens the door.) It's
just Joey and Ross.
Rachel| Why aren't you guys at the movie?
Joey| Well, we were! But Ross was talking so loud on his phone they threw us
out!
Ross| I had to talk loud because the movie was loud!
Joey| (to Monica and Rachel) He's talking to London!
Monica| But why?! Did he get in touch with Emily?
Joey| Well no, not yet. He's calling everyone on her side of the family hoping
that someone will help him get in touch with her.
Ross| (on phone) I-I-I don't care if I said some other girl's name you prissy,
old twit!
Joey| Ross! Way to suck up to the family.
Chandler| (entering, happily, with a bottle of champagne, thinking that Monica
is the only one there) Ha-ha-ha-(sees everyone)-enh-enh. I'm so glad you guys are all
here! My office finally got wrinkle free fax paper!
[Scene| Monica and Rachel's, the next morning, Phoebe, Chandler, Ross, and Monica are
eating breakfast.]
Joey| (entering, wearing a tux) Hey!
Chandler| Oh no-no-no-no-no-no, vomit tux! No-no, vomit tux!
Joey| Don't worry, I had it dry-cleaned.
Monica| Vomit tux? Who vomited ony'know what, what you up to Joe?
Joey| Well, I'm doing this telethon thing on TV and my agent got me a job as
co-host!
Monica| Oh that's great!
Joey| A little uh, good deed for PBS and a little TV exposure, now that's the
kind of math Joey likes to do!
Phoebe| Ugh, PBS!
Monica| What's wrong with PBS?
Phoebe| Ugh, what's right with them?
Joey| Why dont you like PBS, Pheebs?
Phoebe| Okay, 'cause right after my mom killed herself, I was just in this
really bad place, y'know personally. So, I just thought that it'd make me feel better if I
wrote to Sesame Street, 'cause they were so nice when I was a little kid! No one
ever wrote back.
Chandler| Well y'know a lot of those Muppets don't have thumbs.
Phoebe| All I got was a lousy key chain! And by that time I was living in a box.
I didn't have keys!
Joey| I'm sorry Pheebs, I just, y'know, I just wanted to do a good deed.
Like-like you did with the babies.
Phoebe| This isn't a good deed, you just wanted to get on TV! This is totally
selfish.
Joey| Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! What about you, having those babies for your brother?
Talk about selfish!
Phoebe| What-what are you talking about?!
Joey| Well, yeah, it was a really nice thing and all, but it made you feel
really good right?
Phoebe| Yeah. So?
Joey| It made you feel good, so that makes it selfish. Look, there's no
unselfish good deeds, sorry.
Phoebe| Yes there are! There are totally good deeds that are selfless.
Joey| Well, may I ask for one example?
Phoebe| Yeah, it's Y'know there'sno you may not!
Joey| That's because all people are selfish.
Phoebe| Are you calling me selfish?!
Joey| Are you calling you people? (Chandler rolls his eyes.) Yeah, well sorry to
burst that bubble, Pheebs, but selfless good deeds don't exist. Okay? And you the deal on
Santa Clause right?
Phoebe| I'm gonna find a selfless good dead. I'm gonna beat you, you evil
genius.
Ross| (on phone) Hello.
Emily| (on phone from London) Hello, Ross?
Ross| Emily? Emily! Oh my God! Oh my God, it's Emily! (He picks up a lamp and
hands it to Chandler, for no reason.) It's Emily everyone! Shush-shush-shhst! (to Emily)
Hi!
Emily| Ross, I'm only ringing to say stop harassing my relatives. Good-bye!
Ross| No wait! Look, wait! Okay, you can hang up, but I'm gonna keep calling!
I'm gonna, I'm gonna call everyone in England if that's what it takes to get you to talk
to me!
Emily| Really? About what?
Ross| Look you're my wife. We're-we're married. Y'know? I-I love you. I-I really
miss you.
Emily| I miss you to. Well, at least I think I do.
Ross| (to the gang, whispering) She's talking.
All| (subdued) Yay! (He motions for them to keep quiet, including Chandler who
is still holding the lamp Ross handed him, before he goes off to talk to Emily in
private.)
Phoebe| Hey, Joey, when you said the deal with Santa Clause, you meant?
Joey| That he doesn't exist.
Phoebe| Right. (She turns and opens her eyes in shock.)
[Scene| Central Perk, Chandler, Monica, and Rachel are there.]
Rachel| So Chandler, have you heard about Monica's secret boyfriend?
Chandler| Uhh, yeah. She uh, she uh, she uh might've mentioned him.
Rachel| So Mon, when are we gonna meet this new secret waiter man?
Monica| Ohh, he's really shy. I-I dont think he's up to meeting everyone
yet.
Chandler| Yeah, I don't think he's up to meeting everyone yet.
Rachel| I dont care! I wanna meet this guy who's the best sex she ever
had!
Chandler| Really?! That's what you heard? (To Monica) You said that?
Monica| I might've said that. (Chandler laughs.) Why is that funny?
Chandler| Because I'm very happy for him! (To Monica) And you, you lucky
dog!
Ross| (entering) Hi!
Monica| Hey!
Ross| Well, Emily's willing to work on the relationship.
Chandler| Yes!
Monica| That's great!
Ross| In London!
Monica| What?!
Ross| She wants me to move to London.
Monica| But you live here! (Ross rolls his eyes.) You know that.
Rachel| What-what-what are you gonna do?
Ross| I bet if I talk to Carol and Susan I can convince them to move to London
with Ben.
Monica| Yeah, I'm sure your ex-wife will be more than happy to move to another
country so you can patch things up with your new wife.
Ross| It could happen.
[Scene| Unitel Video, Studio 55, Joey's telethon, he is being shown around by the stage
director.]
Joey| (To the pledge volunteers) How ya doin'? Welcome. Good to see ya!
Stage Director| This will be your phone.
Joey| That's great. But uh, I'm not really expecting a lot of calls.
Stage Director| No you answer it and take pledges.
Joey| But I'm the host!
Stage Director| No, Gary Collins is the host. You'll be answering the phones.
Joey| You don't seem to understand. See, I was Dr. Drake Remoray.
Stage Director| Well, here's your phone doctor. (She walks away.)
[Scene| Monica and Rachel's, Phoebe, Rachel, and Monica are there.]
Phoebe| I cannot believe I can't find a selfless good deed! Y'know that old guy
that lives next to me? Well, I snuck over there and-and raked up all the leaves on his
front stoop. But he caught me and force-fed me cider and cookies. Then I felt wonderful.
That old jackass!
Rachel| Maybe Joey's right. Maybe all good deeds are selfish.
Phoebe| I will find a selfless good deed! 'Cause I just gave birth to three
children and I will not let them be raised in a world where Joey is right!
Chandler| (entering) Hey, Monica? Can I ask you a cooking question?
Monica| Sure!
Chandler| If you're cooking on the stove, does that mean that your new secret
boyfriend is better in bed than Richard?
Rachel| Chandler! (Pause) Is he?
Monica| Well, y'know I-I-I think I'm gonna respect the privacy of my new secret
boyfriend.
Chandler| Why?! I mean if this guy was me and it was me who had
learned that it was me who was the best you'd ever had, I'd be going like this. (He
jumps up onto the table and starts doing his happy dance.)
[Scene| Ross's apartment, he's on the phone with Emily.]
Ross| All right Emily, as much as I love you, I'm sorry, I can't move to London
without Ben.
Emily| I understand that would be difficult.
Ross| Yeah, would you please consider moving here? I mean you were gonna
move here anyway, why can't you just do that?
Emily| I don't know, it's just
Ross| Oh-oh-okay, but-but I know, that even though I've been a-a complete
idiot up 'til now, I mean, I mean you-you-you have to come here. You have to come here so
we can work this out.
Emily| All right.
Ross| All right, did you just say all right?
Emily| I did. Now I'm the idiot.
Ross| Oh, Emily that is, that is so great. It's gonna be so great! We're gonna
be like-like-like two idiots in love!
Emily| Ross, there's one thing that really scares me still.
Ross| Yes, tell me.
Emily| Well, you have to understand how humiliating it was for me up on that
altar in front of my entire family, all my friends.
Ross| I know. I am, I am so sorry.
Emily| And then after decided to forgive you, seeing you at the airport catching
our plane with her.
Ross| Again, very sorry.
Emily| I mean, I can't-I can't be in the same room as her! It drives me mad just
thinking of you being in the same room as her!
Ross| Emily, there is nothing between Rachel and me. Okay? I love you.
Emily| All right. I'll come to New York and we'll try and make this work.
Ross| Oh that is so great! That's
Emily| (interrupting him) As long as you don't see Rachel anymore.
[Scene| Monica and Rachel's, Ross is telling Phoebe, Monica, and Chandler about Emily's
ultimatum.]
Ross| So I asked Emily if she would come to New York, and she said yes.
Chandler| Yes!
Phoebe| Ooh-ohh!
Monica| Great!
Ross| No-no-no! Only if I promise never to see Rachel again.
Phoebe| Why?
Monica| What?! You can'twhat did you tell her?
Ross| I told her I'd have to think about it. I mean, how the hell am I supposed
to make this kind of a decision? (They're all quiet.) I'm actually asking you!
Chandler| Well, you can't just not see Rachel anymore, she's one of your best
friends.
Monica| Yeah! But, he can't not exactly see Emily, I mean that's his wife.
Phoebe| Yeah.
Chandler| That's true!
Phoebe| Yeah, but you've known Rachel since High School and you cannot just cut
her out of your life.
Chandler| That's true!
Monica| No, you cannot.
Ross| Thanks for the help, problem solved. (Wipes his hands.)
Monica| (answering it) Hello.
Joey| (on phone) Hey Mon!
Monica| Oh hey Joey! We've been watching all day, when are you gonna be on TV?
Joey| See, there was kind of a mix up in my agent's office, but I'm still on TV
and that's good exposure.
Monica| (Looking at the TV) You're not on TV.
Joey| Oh, uh, okay, how, how about now? (He waves his hand in front of the woman
next to him and you can now see his arm on TV.)
Chandler| Hey, there he is! There he is!
Joey| Hello New York! (The woman bats his hand out of the way.)
[Scene| Chandler and Joey's, the chick and the duck are watching Emeril Live, a cooking
show.]
Emeril| (on TV.) Now maybe you just like wanna but the whole duck in there! Who
cares, y'know? Now I got the legs
Chandler| How many times have I told you guys, you never watch the
cooking channel!
Monica| (entering) Hi Chandler.
Chandler| Hey!
Monica| Uh, listen, I need that broiling pan that Joey borrowed the other day.
Chandler| Oh that was yours? Uh, yeah, we used it when the duck was throwing up
caterpillars.
Monica| William Sonoma, fall catalog, Page 27.
Chandler| Expect it in 4-6 weeks. (She starts to leave.) Umm, hey, umm, Joey's
gonna be at the telethon for the rest of the day, we have the whole place to ourselves.
Monica| Yeah, so?
Chandler| Well I just, thought maybe you'd wanna book some time with the best
you'd ever had.
Monica| Y'know what, champ? I think I'll pass.
Chandler| Why?
Monica| Why? (She hops into the living room and imitates Chandler's happy
dance.)
Chandler| What's your point?
[Scene| The Telethon, Joey's phone rings and he answers it.]
Joey| (in a bored voice) PBS telethon.
Phoebe| (on phone from Central Perk) Hey Joey, I just wanted to let you know
that I found a selfless good deed. I just went down to the park and I let a bee sting me.
Joey| What?! What good is that gonna do anybody?
Phoebe| Well, it helps the bee look tough in front of his bee friends. The bee
is happy and I am definitely not.
Joey| Now, y'know the bee probably died after he stung ya.
Phoebe| (Thinks for a moment.) Aw, dammit! (Slams the phone down.)
Stage Director| Back on in 30 seconds people!
Joey| Hey, excuse me, would you mind switching with me?
PBS Volunteer| Hey, no way, I'm in the shot man.
Joey| Come on man! You've been here all day!
PBS Volunteer| Yeah, I-I'm taking pledges here, eh?
Stage Director| We're on in 3, 2, (points to Gary Collins.)
Gary Collins| Welcome back to our fall telethon. Now if you've been enjoying the
performance of Cirque Du Soleil, (As he is speaking, Joey and the volunteer
getting into a shoving match.) and you'd like to see more of the same kind of programming,
it's very simple. All you have to do (Joey is knocked down.) is call in your pledge and at
that time tell the operator, one of our volunteers, what kind of programming you'd like
to (Just as the volunteer sits down, Joey pulls him to the ground.)
[Scene| Monica and Rachel's, Monica and Phoebe are cooking, Chandler is reading a
magazine.]
Ross| (entering) Okay, that's it. I cannot make this decision! It is too
difficult, so I'm just gonna leave it entirely to the gods of fate. (He holds up and
starts shaking a)
Monica| A Magic Eight ball?! You can't be serious, you can't make this decision
with a toy!
Phoebe| Ooh, it's not a toy.
Ross| Well, I don't know what else to do. I mean, I either keep my wife and lose
one of my-my-my best friends or I keep my friend and get divorced the second time before
I'm 30! So-so if anyone has-has a better suggestion, let's hear it! 'Cause I-I got
nothing! All right, don't be shy, any suggestion will do. (There are none.) Okay then.
Here we go. Magic 8 Ball, should I never see Rachel again? (He turns it over and reads the
answer) Ask again later. Later is not good enough. (He shakes it up again and reads the
answer.) Ask again later. What the hell! This is broken! It-it is broken!
Monica| All right, let me see. (She grabs the 8 ball.) Will Chandler have sex
tonight? (Reads the answer.) Don't count on it. Seems like it works to me.
[Scene| The Telethon, Joey answers his ringing phone.]
Joey| (in an unenthusiastic voice) PBS Telethon.
Phoebe| (on phone) Hi Joey.
Joey| Hey Pheebs!
Phoebe| I would like to make a pledge. I would like to donate $200.
Joey| $200? Are you sure Pheebs? I mean, after what Sesame Street did to
ya?
Phoebe| Oh, I'm still mad at them but I also now that they bring happiness to
lots of kids who's moms didn't kill themselves, so by supporting them, I'm doing a good
thing, but I'm not happy about it. So there, a selfless good deed.
Joey| And you don't a little good about donating the money?
Phoebe| No, it sucks. I was saving up to buy a hamster.
Joey| A hamster? What, those things are like 10 bucks.
Phoebe| Yeah, not the one I had my eye on.
Gary Collins| (on TV.) It looks like we have surpassed last year's pledge total!
Thank you viewers! The pledge that did it was taken by one of our volunteers(He
walks over to where Joey is sitting.) Oh boy! And may I say one of our sharpest dressed
volunteers, (Joey stands up.) Mr. Joseph Tribbiani!
Phoebe| Oh, look-look, Joey's on TV! Isn't that great? My pledge got Joey on TV!
Oh that makes me feelOh no! (Realizes that her deed made her happy and therefore
it's selfish and covers her mouth in horror.)
[Scene| Monica and Rachel's, later that day. Monica is coming out of the bathroom
carrying her cleaning gear.]
Chandler| (entering) Look, maybe I got carried away before. But there's
something you gotta know. If I'm the best, it's only because you've made me the best.
Monica| Keep talking.
Chandler| I mean I was nothing before you. Call the other girls and ask. Which
wouldn't take long. But when I'm with you, and we're together, OHMYGOD.
Monica| Really?
Chandler| Oh-aw my God! Now, I understand if you never want to sleep with me
again, but that would be wrong. We're too good! We owe it, to sex!
Monica| Well, if we owe it? (She throws down her cleaning stuff and jumps into
his arms.) Oh my When is Joey gonna be home?
Chandler| Well, I was kinda hoping we could do this without him. (She starts to
take off her latex gloves.) Oh no-no-no, leave the gloves on.
Monica| But, I just cleaned the bathroom.
Chandler| Yeah, why don't we lose the gloves.
Monica| Yeah. (She takes them off.)
Chandler| All right, let's show them how it's done.
Monica| Okay.
Monica| Ow!
Chandler| Y'know that wasn't part of it?
Monica| I know!
[Scene| Ross's apartment, Ross is prying at the Magic 8 Ball with a screwdriver as
there's a knock on his door which he goes to answer.]
Rachel| (entering) Hi! Are you ready? We're gonna be late!
Ross| For what?
Rachel| For Stella! Remember? She's gettin' her grove back in like 20 minutes.
Ross| Yeah, I uh, totally forgot about that. You mind if I take a rain check?
I'm waiting for a call from Emily.
Rachel| Sure. I guess. Hey, I hear you don't have to go to London. Yay!
Ross| It's not that easy, there's still a lot of relationship stuff.
Rachel| Like what?
Ross| Just stuff. Y'know kinda what Emily wants.
Rachel| Well, why don't you talk to me about it, maybe I can help.
Ross| No. No. You-you can't help. I mean, I kinda have to do this without your
help.
Rachel| Well, I-I know you can do that too. I'm just, I'm just saying if you
need somebody to talk to Hi!
Ross| Thanks.
Rachel| Ross? Look, whatever this relationship stuff that Emily wants, just give
it to her. Come on, the bottom line here is that you love her. So just fix whatever she
wants fixed. Just do it. (The phone starts ringing.) I mean, you're gonna have to
try. You'll just gonna hate yourself if you don't. (The phone keeps ringing.) Oh come on
answer it! It's driving me crazy!
Ross| (answering the phone.) Hello. (Listens) Hi sweetie. (Listens.) Good. Look
umm, yes I've been thinking about that thing that you wanted me to do and, I can do it.
(Rachel gives him a thumbs up.) So will you come to New York? (Rachel wants to know what
she said, and he gives her a thumbs up and she goes over and hugs him. All the time not
knowing what's going on.)
[Scene| Central Perk, ??????? is playing, as Chandler peaks his head out of the storage
closet and sneaks back to his seat and pretends he's reading something. Then a short while
later Monica pokes her head out of the closet and sneaks back to her seat and sits down,
pretending as if nothing has happened.]
Monica| Never done that before.
Chandler| Nope.
Monica| (quietly) Hi!
Chandler| (quietly) Hi! (They both start kissing.)
Joey| Monica? What time is it?
Chandler| Uhh, 9. (He pushes the clock into the sink.)
Joey| But it's dark out.
Monica| Well that's because you always sleep to noon, silly! This is what 9
looks like.
Joey| I guess I'll get washed up then. Watch that sunrise. (He goes into the
bathroom.)
Monica| I'm really getting tired of sneaking around.
Chandler| I know, me too. Hey! Y'know what if we went away for a whole weekend?
Y'know we'd have no interruptions and we could be naked the entire time.
Monica| All weekend? That's a whole lotta naked.
Chandler| Yeah, I can say that I have a conference and you can say you have a
chef thing.
Monica| Ohh, I've always wanted to go to this culinary fair that they have in
Jersey!
Chandler| Okay, y'know your not though. Let's go. (He starts for his bedroom.)
Monica| Wait! What about Joey?
[Scene| Monica and Rachel's, the next morning, Chandler, Joey, and Phoebe are eating
breakfast.]
Monica| (entering from her room) Hey, guess what I'm doing this weekend! I'm
going to this culinary fair in New Jersey.
Phoebe| Oh weird, Chandler just told us he's got a conference there!
Monica| Oh now that-that-that's funny, it seems like Chandler's conference
could've been in Connecticut or Vermont.
Chandler| I'm not in charge of where the conference is held. Do you want people
to think it's a fake conference? It's a real conference.
Ross| (entering) Hey.
Joey| Hey!
Monica| Hey.
Ross| Is Rachel here? I gotta talk to her.
Monica| No, she's out shopping.
Ross| Damn!
Chandler| What's going on?
Ross| I told Emily to come. And I just need to y'know, talk to Rachel about it.
Phoebe| Wait a minute! So when Emily comes you're just, you're not gonna see
Rachel anymore?
Ross| Well look, I'm just trying to focus on the "I get to see my
wife," part, all right? And not the part that makes me do this. (He takes a big swig
of Pepto Bismol.)
Monica| Wow, so you guys are, you're never gonna be in the same room together?
How is that even gonna work?
Ross| I have no idea. I mean But-but I assure you I will figure it out.
Joey| Doesnt seem like it's going to work, I mean
Rachel| (entering) Hi, guys!
Joey| Hi!
Chandler| Uh, hey!
Rachel| What's going on?
Chandler| We're flipping Monica's mattress.
Joey| So I'm thinking, basically we pick it up and then we flip it.
Phoebe| Yeah that's better than my way.
Rachel| Oh okay, hey guys, would you flip mine too?
Chandler| Aww, man! (They go into Monica's room.)
Rachel| (going through the mail) Oh look! A letter from my mom.
Ross| So, Rach, y'know-y'know how Emily's coming right?
Rachel| Oh yeah! I know.
Phoebe| (To Chandler) Can you hear anything?
Chandler| Oh yes, somebody just said, "Can you hear anything?"
Monica| Hey, Joey's ass! What are you doing?
Joey| (holding a box) Well, remember when they got in that big fight and broke
up and we were all stuck in her with no food or anything? Well, when Ross said Rachel at
the wedding, I figured it was gonna happen again, so I hid this in here.
Monica| Ooh, candy bars, crossword puzzles
Phoebe| Ooh, Madlibs, mine! (Grabs it.)
Chandler| Condoms?
Joey| You don't know how long we're gonna be in here! We may have to
repopulate the Earth.
Chandler| And condoms are the way to do that?
Ross| Anyway it-it kinda-it all boils down to this, the last time I talked to
Emily
Rachel| (interrupting) Oh my God! My dog died!
Ross| What?!
Rachel| Oh my God, Le Poo, our dog!
Ross| Le Poo's still alive?!
Rachel| Oh God, it says he was hit by an ice cream truck and dragged for
nine-(turns over the note)-teen blocks. Oh. (They all come out from Monica's bedroom) Oh
my God.
Monica| Sweetie, we heard you crying. Please don't cry.
Rachel| It's Le Poo.
Phoebe| I know it's le poo right now, but it'll get better.
[Scene| Atlantic City, New Jersey, Chandler and Monica are about to start their weekend
of sex, sex, nothing but sex.]
Chandler| (jumping on the bed) I can't believe it! We're here!
Monica| Ooh, chocolates on the pillows! I love that!
Chandler| Oh, you should live with Joey, Roll-os everywhere.
Monica| Come here. (He does, and they kiss.) Okay, be right back.
Chandler| Oh yes! Monica, get in here! There's a high-speed car chase on!
Monica| We're switching rooms.
Chandler| (looks at what she's holding and shies away) Oh dear God, they gave us
glasses!
Monica| No, they gave us glasses with lipstick on them! I mean, if they didn't
change the glasses, who knows what else they didn't change. (He glares at her.) Come on
sweetie, I just want this weekend to be perfect, I mean we can change rooms, can't we?
Chandler| Okay, but let's do it now though, because Chopper 5 just lost it's
feed! (He grabs their bags and sprints out.)
[Scene| Central Perk, Ross is trying to tell Rachel about Emily's ultimatum again.]
Ross| Hey, so uh, y'know how there's something I wanted to talk to you about?
Rachel| Oh yeah! (Turns to face him.)
Ross| Well, y'know how I'm trying to work things out with Emily. Well, there's
this one thing Okay, (Rachel has her back turned to the camera, and Ross isn't
looking at her.) here goes. I made a promise that-(they cut to the other camera and Ross
notices something coming out of Rachel's nose)-Oh hey!
Rachel| What?
Ross| You're nose is bleeding!
Rachel| Oh God. (He hands her some tissues.) No! Oh not again! (Wiping her
nose.) This-this happened when my grandfather died. It's ugh! Sorry. (She puts her head
back.) Oh, okay, so I'm sorry, what-what were you-what did you want to tell me?
Ross| Umm (Rachel blows her nose.)
Rachel| Sorry. Sorry.
Ross| Okay, I uh, I can't see you anymore.
Rachel| Yeah, I know. It's ridiculous! I can't see you either.
[Scene| Chandler and Monica's weekend, a hotel clerk is showing them their new room.]
Hotel Clerk| I think you'll find this room more to your liking.
Chandler| Okay, great. (He grabs the remote and turns on the TV to the chase.)
Hotel Clerk| (watching the chase) They say he's only got half a tank left.
Chandler| Half a tank? We still got a lot of high-speed chasing to do!
Monica| We're switching rooms again.
Chandler| What? Why?
Monica| This is a garden view room, and we paid for an ocean view room.
Hotel Clerk| Our last ocean view room was unacceptable to you.
Monica| (To Chandler) Excuse me, umm, can I talk to you over here for just a
second?
Chandler| Uh-huh. (He doesn't take his eyes off the TV.)
Monica| Chandler!
Chandler| (turning to face her) Yeah.
Monica| Look, these clowns are trying to take us for a ride and I'm not gonna
let 'em! And we're not a couple of suckers!
Chandler| I hear ya, Mugsy! But look, all these rooms are fine okay? Can you
just pick one so I can watch-(realizes)-have a perfect, magical weekend together with you.
Monica| Okay, this one I like!
Chandler| (watching TV, in fact, ER is on.) Nothing! It's over! Dammit! This is
regularly scheduled programming!
Monica| Can we turn the TV off? Okay? Do we really want to spend the entire
weekend like this?
Chandler| Oh, I'm sorry, am I getting in the way of all the room switching fun?
Monica| Hey, don't blame me for wigging tonight!
Chandler| Oh, who should I blame? The nice bell man who had to drag out luggage
to 10 different rooms?
Monica| I don't know, how about the idiot who thought he could drive from Albany
to Canada on a half a tank of gas!
Chandler| Do not speak ill of the dead.
Monica| We're supposed to uh, be spending a romantic weekend together, it-it,
what is the matter with you?
Chandler| I just want to watch a little television. What is the big deal? Geez,
relax mom.
Monica| What did you say?
Chandler| I said, "Geez, relax Monnnnn."
[Scene| Monica and Rachel's, Rachel is reading a magazine and has two tissues stuck up
her nose in an attempt to stop the bleeding and as she hears Ross enter, she quickly hides
her face behind the magazine and removes the tissues.]
Rachel| Hi!
Ross| Hey. Rachel, I-I-I've been wanting to tell you something for a while now
and I really, I just have to get it out.
Rachel| Okay, what's up?
Ross| Okay, y'know how you told me I should do whatever it takes to fix my
marriage?
Rachel| Yeah, I told you to give Emily whatever she wants.
Ross| And while that was good advice, you should know that what-what she
wants
Rachel| Yeah?
Ross| is for me not to see you anymore.
Rachel| That's crazy! You can't do that! What are you going to tell her? (Pause)
(Realizes) Oh God. Ohh, you already agreed to this, haven't you?
Ross| It's awful I know, I mean, I feel terrible but I have to do this if I want
my marriage to work. And I do, I have to make this marriage work. I have too. But
the good thing is we can still see each other until she gets here.
Rachel| Ohh! Lucky me! Oh my God! That is good news, Ross! I think that's
the best news I've heard since Le Poo died!
Ross| You have no idea what a nightmare this has been. This is so hard.
Rachel| Oh yeah, really? Is it Ross? Yeah? Okay, well let me make this a just a
little bit easier for you.
Ross| What are you doing?
Rachel| Storming out!
Ross| Rachel, this is your apartment.
Rachel| Yeah, well that's how mad I am!!
[Scene| Chandler and Joey's, Chandler is returning from his disastrous weekend. He
throws his bag down and sits down on one of the leather chairs, but he sits on something
and picks it up and throws it away.]
Chandler| Damn Rollos!
Joey| Hey, you're back!
Chandler| Hey.
Joey| How was your conference?
Chandler| It was terrible. I fought with (Pause) my colleagues y'know, the
entire time. Are you kidding with this? (Throws away another Rollo)
Joey| Oh, so your weekend was a total bust?
Chandler| Uh, no, I got to see Donald Trump waiting for an elevator.
Monica| (entering) Hi!
Joey| Hey, you're back too!
Monica| Yeah. Umm, Chandler can I talk to you outside for a second?
Joey| Hey, how was your chef thing?
Monica| Oh, it was awful. (To Chandler) I guess some people just don't
appreciate really good food.
Chandler| Well, maybe it was the kind of food that tasted good at first but then
made everybody vomit and have diarrhea.
Monica| Chandler! (Motions for him to come outside.)
Chandler| Monica. (Follows her out.)
Monica| Okay, I'd like to know how much the room was because I'd like to pay my
half.
Chandler| Okay, fine, $300.
Monica| 300 dollars?!
Chandler| Yeah, just think of it as $25 per room!
Monica| Urghh!!
Joey| (sticking his head out the door) What are you guys woofing about?
Monica| Chandler stole a twenty from my purse!
Joey| Nooooo!!! Y'know what? Now that I think about it, I constantly find myself
without twenties and you always have lots!
[Scene| Central Perk, Ross is drinking some Alka-Seltzer. The rest of the gang,
minus Rachel is there as well.]
Ross| You should've seen the look on her face. I don't want Rachel to hate me! I
don't know what to do.
Joey| You want my advice?
Ross| Yes! Please!
Joey| You're not gonna like it.
Ross| That's okay.
Joey| You got married to fast.
Ross| That's not advice!
Joey| I told ya.
Ross| I'm going to the bathroom. (Gets up and exits.)
Joey| Man, if anyone asked me to give up any of you, I couldn't do it.
Chandler and Phoebe|
Monica| Maybe I could do it.
Rachel| (entering) Hi!
Joey| Hi, Rach.
Chandler| Hi!
Phoebe| Hey.
Monica| Hey.
Rachel| Look, I know you guys heard about the whole thing with me and Ross but
y'know, I've been obsessing about it all day and I'd just love not to talk about
it. All right?
Joey| I-I-I don't know if this falls under this category, but uh, Ross is right
back there. (Points over his shoulder.)
Rachel| That's not Ross!
Phoebe| Oh no! Not that guy! He does look like him though.
Chandler| Okay, Ross is in the bathroom.
Rachel| Oh my God, its happening. It's already started. I'm Kip.
Joey| Hey, you're not Kip!
Rachel| (To Joey) Do you even know who Kip is?
Joey| Who cares? You're Rachel! (To Chandler) Who's Kip?
Chandler| Kip, my old roommate, y'know we all used to hang out together.
Joey| Oh, that poor bastard.
Rachel| See? Yeah, you told me the story. He and Monica dated when they broke up
they couldn't even be in the same room together and you all promised that you would stay
his friend and what happened? He got phased out!
Monica| You're not gonna be phased out!
Rachel| Well, of course I am! It's not gonna happen to Ross! He's your brother.
(To Chandler) He's your old college roommate. Ugh, it was just a matter of time before
someone had to leave the group. I just always assumed Phoebe would be the one to go.
Phoebe| Ehh!!
Rachel| Honey, come on! You live far away! You're not related. You lift right
out.
[Scene| Chandler and Joey's, Joey is watching TV.]
Chandler| (entering) Hey!
Joey| Hey, Mr. Bing. That uh, hotel you stayed at called. Said someone left an
eyelash curler in your room.
Chandler| Yes that was mine.
Joey| 'Cause I figured you'd hooked up with some girl and she'd left it there.
Chandler| Yes that would have made more sense.
Joey| Y'know, I-I don't even feel like I know you anymore man! All right, look,
I'm just gonna ask you this one time. And whatever you say, I'll believe ya. (Pause.) Were
you, or were you not on a gay cruise?!
[Scene| Central Perk, Phoebe is sitting on couch and Rachel is getting some coffee.
Phoebe keeps turning her head from to keep from looking at Rachel.]
Rachel| Phoebe? (She turns her head further away.) I'm sorry about the whole
lifting out thing. (Moves over next to her.) You gotta come with me!
Phoebe| Come where?
Rachel| Wherever I go. Come on you and me, we'll-we'll start a new group, we're
the best ones.
Phoebe| Okay, but try and get Joey too.
Ross| (entering) Pheebs, you mind if I speak to Rachel alone for a sec?
Phoebe| Oh, sure! (She gets up to leave.) Bye Ross! (Whispering behind his
back.) Forever.
Ross| Hi.
Rachel| Hi. What are you doing here? Isn't this against the rules?
Ross| I talked to Monica, look, I'm the one who made the choice. I'm the
one who's making things change, so I should be the one to y'know, step back.
Rachel| Oh, Ross
Ross| No, no, it's okay. Really. They're plenty of people who just see their
sisters at Thanksgiving and just see their college roommates at reunions and just see Joey
at Burger King. So is, is that better?
Rachel| No, it's not better. I still don't get to see you.
Ross| Well, what-what would you do? Rach, if you were me, what-what would you
do?
Rachel| Well, for starters I would've said the right name at my wedding!
Ross| I can't believe this is happening.
Rachel| I know.
Ross| I am so sorry.
Rachel| I know that too.
Joey| (entering) (He clears his throat to get their attention.) Hey, Rach? Sorry
to interrupt but umm, Phoebe wanted me to talk to you about a trip or something.
[Scene| Monica and Rachel's, Monica is doing a crossword puzzle.]
Chandler| (entering) Hey!
Monica| Hi.
Chandler| I just came over to drop offnothing. So that weekend kinda
sucked, huh?
Monica| Yeah, it did.
Chandler| So, I guess this is over.
Monica| What?
Chandler| Well, y'know, you and me, it had to end sometime.
Monica| Why, exactly?
Chandler| Because of the weekend, we had a fight.
Monica| Chandler that's crazy! If you give up every time you'd have a fight with
someone you'd never be with anyone longer thanOhhh! (They both realize something
there.)
Chandler| So, this isn't over?
Monica| (laughs) You are so cute! No. No, it was a fight. You deal with it and
move on! It's nothing to freak out about.
Chandler| Really? Okay. Great!
Monica| Ohh, welcome to an adult relationship! (She goes to kiss him.)
Chandler| (stops her) We're in a relationship?
Monica| I'm afraid so.
Chandler| Okay.
[Scene| Monica and Rachel's, Monica, Rachel, Joey, and Chandler are there as Phoebe
enters.]
Phoebe| Hey!
Monica| Hey!
Phoebe| Oh hey, Monica, I heard you saw Donald Trump at your convention.
Monica| Yeah, I saw him waiting for an elevator.
Monica| Hey, Rach, can I borrow your eyelash curler, I think I lost mine.
Rachel| Yeah, it's in there. (Points to the bathroom.)
Joey| (shocked) Oh! Ohh! Oh!!
Chandler| Joey, can I talk to you for a second? (He grabs him and starts to drag
Joey into Monica's room.)
Joey| Oohh!! Ohh! Oh-oh-oh! Oh-oh!!
Joey| Ohhhhhhhhhhh!!!!!!!
Chandler| Yes. Yes. (Lets him up.)
Joey| (To Chandler) You?! (To Monica) And-and you?!
Monica| Yes, but you cannot tell anyone! No one knows!
Joey| How?! When?!
Chandler| It happened in London.
Joey| IN LONDON!!!
Chandler| The reason we didn't tell anyone was because we didn't want to make a
big deal out of it.
Joey| But it is a big deal!! I have to tell someone!
Chandler| No-no-no-no-no! You can't!
Monica| Please? Please?! We just don't want to deal with telling everyone, okay?
Just promise you won't tell.
Joey| All right! Man, this is unbelievable! I mean, it's great, but
Monica| I know, it's great!
Joey| Aww, I don't want to see that!
Phoebe| We're so stupid! Do you know what's going on in there? They're trying to
take Joey!
[Scene| Monica and Rachel's, the gang, minus Ross are playing Madlibs. Phoebe is
reading hers.]
Phoebe| The most popular Phoebe in tennis is called the overhand Phoebe. And if
you win, you must slap your opponent on the Phoebe and say, "Hi, Phoebe!"
Monica| Oh that's cute! We really all enjoyed it. But y'know, it doesn't count.
Phoebe| Count for what?
Monica| Count in our heads as-as good Madlibs.
Joey| I guess I'm done.
Chandler| Fun's over!
Monica| Wait-wait, guys! If-if we follow the rules, it's still fun and it means
something!
Rachel| Uh-huh!
Joey| I think I'm gonna take-off.
Monica| Guys, rules are good! Rules help control the fun! (They all leave and
close the door on Monica.) Ohhh! (Throws her notepad down in disgust.)
[Scene| Chandler and Joey's, Monica and Chandler are making out on one of the chairs.]
Joey| (entering) Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!! None of that, not while you're living
under my roof!
Monica| What?!
Joey| Look, just because I know about you two, doesn't mean I like
looking at it.
Chandler| Aren't you supposed to be at an audition for another hour?
Joey| Well, I'm sorry if I'm not a middle-aged black woman! (Starts for his
room.) And I'm also sorry if sometimes I go to the wrong audition! Okay, look, if I
have to pretend I don't know about you two, then you two are gonna have to pretend there's
nothing to know about.
Chandler and Monica|
Monica| Sorry.
Chandler| Sorry.
Joey| (from the bedroom) I can hear that!
Monica| (To Chandler) Rachel's at work.
Joey| I can still hear you!
[Scene| Central Perk, Joey, Chandler, and Monica are there as Phoebe enters carrying a
large box.]
Phoebe| Hey!
Joey| Hey!
Chandler| Hello!
Monica| Hey, what's that?
Phoebe| Yeah, my mom sent me a family heirloom that once belonged to my
grandmother. Can you believe it?! A year ago I didn't even have a family, and now I have
heirlooms for crying out loud.
Phoebe| Eeeee-(She opens the box and removes its contents and sees that it's a
fur coat.)-ohh!! God! (She throws it at Joey.)
Joey| Argh-argh!! (Catches the coat.) Ooh, soft. Is this mink?
Phoebe| Yeah! Why would my mother send me a fur? Doesn't she know me but
at all! Plus, I have a perfectly fine coat that no innocent animal suffered to make!
Chandler| Yeah, just some 9-year-old Filipino kids who worked their fingers
bloody for 12 cents an hour. (Phoebe stares at him wide-eyed. Chandler sees her reaction.)
That didn't happen, I made that up!
Ross| (entering) Hey!
Gunther| Oh, Ross? Ross! You can't put up flyers in here.
Ross| How come? Everybody else does.
Gunther| You can't.
Monica| What is that?
Ross| Oh, umm, I'm just getting rid of a couple of things.
Monica| (looking at the flyer) This is all of your things.
Ross| Yes, yes it is! No, but it's good it'sEmily thinks we should get all
new stuff. Stuff that's just ours, together. Y'know brand new.
Monica| So basically, this is a getting-rid-of-everything-Rachel-ever-used sale.
Ross| Touched. Used. Sat on. Sleep on.
Gunther| I'll take it all.
Joey| Hey, Ross, you're okay with that?
Ross| Look, if I can just do what Emily wants and get her to New York,
I'm sure everything will be fine.
Chandler| Okay, but don't you think this is a little extreme?
Ross| After what I did? Can you blame her?
Phoebe| Oh my God! You got off easy! When my friend Silvie's husband said
someone else's name in bed, she cursed him and turned his thingy green.
Joey| (after Ross is gone) What is he doing? What, Emily, thinks Ross's
furniture has got Rachel coodies?
Monica| Now calm down Joey.
Joey| No! Everything's gettin' all messed up, y'know? Emily won't let Ross see
Rachel, we're not gonna stop seeing Rachel, hence Ross stops seeing us!
Phoebe| Oh, I hate this. Everything's changing.
Chandler| Yeah I know, we're losing Ross, Joey said hence
Monica| Look, I'm not happy about this either, but y'know if-if Ross says he's
happy then we're just gonna have to keep our feelings about Emily to ourselves. Are you
cool with that?
Joey| No! But y'know, I'm an actor, I'll act cool.
[Scene| The Storage Room in the basement of Monica and Rachel's building, Monica and
Rachel are looking for something.]
Rachel| Ohh, whoa God! Storage rooms give me the creeps! Monica, come on please
hurry up honey! Please?
Monica| Rachel, if you want the little round waffles, you gotta have to wait
until I find the little waffle iron.
Rachel| I want the little round waffles.
Monica| All right. (Looking through a box.) Op, here it is! Right underneath the
can of-of bug bomb. I wonder if the best place to put something that cooks food is
underneath the can of poison?
Rachel| Okay, y'know what? I'll-I'll have toast!
Rachel| Arghhhh!!!!!!
Monica| Oh my God! Fog him! Fog him!
[Scene| Central Perk, Chandler, Joey, and Phoebe are there.]
Phoebe| I don't know what I'm gonna do about this coat.
Joey| I'll take it!
Phoebe| That might work! (She gives him the coat.)
Joey| Ooh-ooh-ooh, yeah! (He drapes it around his shoulders.) Enh? All right,
what do you think?
Chandler| You're on in 5 Ms. Minnelli.
Ross| (on the phone) No-no-no, it's just a bit sudden. (Listens) No, it's great.
Okay? I'm totally on board. I love you too, all righty. Bye. (Hangs up.)
Joey| What's the matter Ross?
Ross| Nothing. Oh, actually, great news! I just got off the phone with Emily and
it looks like I'm moving to a new apartment. Woo-hoo!
Phoebe| Why?
Ross| Well, her thought is, and I agree, fresh new furniture, why not a fresh
new apartment? Her cousin has this great place to sublet, it's got a view of the river on
one side and Columbia on the other.
Joey| That's way uptown! That's like three trains away! (Phoebe pinches him.)
Which is great! I love to ride that rail!
Chandler| So you're really okay with this?
Ross| Yes! Yes! I mean it's-it's kinda far from work, but uh, y'know, I'll get
so much done on the commute. I-I've been given the gift of time!
Chandler| Now that's so funny, because last Christmas I got the gift of space.
We should get them together and make a continuum.
Joey| Now he's movin'? Man, what is Emily doing to him? (Phoebe pinches him
again.) Ow!! He's not even here!!!
Rachel| You guys! You guys!
Monica| We were, we were just in the storage area and we saw this really creepy
man!
Rachel| It was like this crazy-eyed, hairy beast man! He was like a, like a
bigfoot or a yeti or something!
Monica| And he came at us with an axe, so Rachel had to use a bug bomb on him!
Rachel| (proud of herself) Yeah, I-I-I just pulled the tab and I just fogged his
yeti ass!
Joey| Uhh, like dark hair, bushy beard?
Rachel| Yeah!
Joey| Yeah, you fogged Danny.
Rachel| Please! We did not fog Danny! Who's Danny?
Joey| Dan just moved in downstairs. Yeah, he just got back from like this
four-month trek in the Andes. Nice fella.
Monica| Oh he's nice. He's nice! Y'know, you always stick up for the people we
fog!
[Scene| Their Building, Monica and Rachel are going to apologize to Danny. Rachel
knocks on his door, which he opens and he has this really bushy beard and long hair.
Picture Paul Bunyan.]
Danny| Yeah?
Rachel| Hi! You might not remember us, but we are the girls that fogged
you.
Monica| We're-we're really sorry we fogged you.
Danny| Okay.
Rachel| Hi! Just so you know, we-we didn't mean to fog you, we thought
you were like a yeti or something.
Danny| Okay.
Danny| Yesss?
Rachel| Hi! Sorry to bother you, but I don't think we can accept your
acceptance of our apology, it just doesn't really seem like you mean it.
Monica| Yeah.
Danny| O-kay!
Monica| Wow! That guy is so rude!
Rachel| Really! What is with that guy? I mean you'd forgive me if I fogged you.
Monica| Well you did a little bit.
Rachel| Oh my God, honey, I'm so sorry!
Monica| I totally forgive you!
Rachel| Really?
Monica| Yes!
[Scene| Monica and Rachel's, Monica is making a drink as Phoebe enters with the fur
coat.]
Phoebe| Hey!
Monica| Hey!
Phoebe| So listen, you know my friend Chris who owns the crematorium?
Monica| Crematorium Chris? Sure!
Phoebe| He says, that he would cremate my fur coat for free if I umm, y'know,
bring in the next person I know who dies.
Rachel| Oh my God! Oh my God, look at these pelts!
Monica| Don't get too attached, she's having it cremated.
Rachel| What? Uhh, Phoebe, honey, honey, I know you're quirky and I get a big
kick out of it, we all do actually, but if you destroy a coat like this that is like a
crime against nature! Not nature, fashion!
Phoebe| This is fashion?! (Grabs the coat from Rachel.) Okay, so to you, death
is fashion?! That's really funny. (She puts the coat on and starts to model it.) Here's
Phoebe umm, sporting uh, y'know, cutting edge hairy carcass from y'know, the steal traps
of wintry Russia. I mean, you really thing this looks good? (Sees herself in the
mirror.) 'Cause I do.
[Scene| Ross's Apartment, the gang is helping Ross move out by carrying boxes. Chandler
has picked a particularly large and apparently heavy box, because he takes a running start
at it and still can't budge it.]
Ross| (on phone) I know I miss you too. I can't wait to see you. I love you.
Bye. (Hangs up.)
Chandler| Okay, what is in here? Rocks?
Ross| No-no, this is my collection of fossil samples.
Chandler| So, rocks.
Ross| I'm really gonna miss this apartment. Y'know, Ben-Ben took his first steps
right over there. (Points.)
Joey| Ohh. Hey, remember when I ran into this thing (The shutters that close off
the kitchen.) and it kinda knocked me out a little?
Ross| I loved this place! To tell you the truth, I wish I didn't have to move.
Joey| Uhh, are you saying that you're not entirely happy about this?
Ross| Well, I mean if uh, if Emily gave me a choice
Joey| You do have a choice!! Ross, why are you listening to her?! Are
you, are you crazy?!
Ross| Why?
Joey| It's not right what Emily wants you to do! She is totally-(The gang enters
behind Joey and Phoebe pinches him again.)-Owww!! Stop pinching me! Look, now you guys
said I only had to keep my mouth shut as long as Ross was happy, right? Well he just told
me that he's not entirely happy.
Ross| What's going on?
Joey| We all hate Emily!
Phoebe| Nooo!!
Monica| No, Ross, we do not hate Emily. We-we just, we just think that you're
having to sacrifice a whole lot to make her happy.
Joey| Yeah!
Chandler| Look, we just think that maybe she's being a little unreasonable.
Joey| Yes! Yes! Unreasonable!
Ross| Unreasonable? How about we have this conversation when one of you guys
gets married! You have no idea what it takes to make a marriage work! All right,
it's about compromise! Do you always like it? No! Do you do it? Yes! Because it's not all
laughing, happy, candy in the sky, drinking coffee at Central Perk all the time! It's real
life, okay? It's what grown-ups do! (He storms out.)
Phoebe| I think he's right. You guys hang out at the coffeehouse way too much.
[Scene| Central Perk, Monica, Phoebe, Joey, and Chandler are recovering from Ross's
rebuke.]
Monica| God, I feel so guilty about Ross.
Phoebe| Oh, I know.
Joey| I kinda feel like it's my fault.
Chandler| Kind of? If you just kept this to yourself none of this would've
happened.
Joey| Well, I'm keeping so many things to myself these days, something was bound
to slip out! (He glares at Chandler.)
Chandler| Well, I think it's very brave what you said.
Phoebe| All right, I can't sit here anymore. I have to walk places. (She puts on
her fur coat.)
Chandler| Pheebs, what are you doing with the coat? How about the whole animal
rights thing?
Phoebe| Well, I've been reading up and for your information, minks are not very
nice. Okay, I admit it! I love this coat! Okay, Iit's the best thing I've ever had
wrapped around me, including Phil Huntley! (She starts to leave but stops and says to
Monica.) Remember Phil Huntley? He was fine!
[Scene| Their building's lobby, Danny is checking his mailbox as Rachel enters carrying
shopping bags and goes to her mailbox. Danny has shaved his beard and cut his hair, Rachel
doesn't recognize him.]
Rachel| Hi!
Danny| So you like the short hair better.
Rachel| What? YetiI mean Danny?
Danny| I had to cut my hair to get rid of the uh, fogger smell.
Rachel| Oh. Listen, I'm so sorry. I would, I would've never fogged you if y'know
if you hadn't looked so. Y'know.
Danny| Absolutely. Some people are just into appearances.
Rachel| (shocked) What?
Danny| That's cool. Cool. (Starts to leave.)
Rachel| What? Hey! No-no-no! This not cool! You don't even know me!
Danny| Come on, you got the shopping bags and the Sack's catalog.
Rachel| So from that you think you've got me all figured out? Well, you don't!
Y'know I-I could have toys for underprivileged kids in here!
Danny| Do you?
Rachel| Well, y'know, if-if kids like to play with Capri pants.
Danny| Okay. (Heads for his apartment.)
Rachel| And stop saying that! I hate that!
Danny| Okay!
Rachel| Fine! I judged you. I made a snap judgement. But you did it too! And you
are worse because you are sticking to your stupid snap judgement! You can't even open up
your mind for a second to see if you're wrong! What does that say about you?
Danny| The pizza-place across the street any good?
Rachel| What?!
Danny| I'm hungry. Wanna get some pizza? You can keep yelling if there's more.
Rachel| Okay. Okay.
Danny| Stop saying that. I hate that.
[Scene| Ross's now empty apartment, he is spackling some holes shut as the gang comes
to apologize.]
Chandler| Uh, Ross?
Phoebe| Are you still mad at us?
Ross| Yep.
Phoebe| Oh good! Because we have an "I'm sorry" song.
Ross| Y'know what? I'm really not in the mood.
Joey| Look, Ross, I feel really bad. I mean, you're going through all this stuff
and I just acted like a jerk.
Chandler| Yeah, we are so sorry.
Phoebe| (To Chandler) You're kinda stepping on the song. (She gets ready to play
but is stopped by)
Joey| Look, we were way out of line, we totally support you.
Monica| Whatever you decide, whatever you do.
Phoebe| Okay, now you're just taking lines right out of the song!
Ross| Look, this is hard enough! I really need you guys right now.
Phoebe| Yes! Exactly! And that's why
Monica| Why don't you come over tonight? And I'll make you favorite dinner.
Ross| Okay. Thanks you guys. Pheebs are you wearing fur?
Phoebe| Okay, let's get some perspective people; it's not like I'm wearing a
seeing-eye dog coat!
[Scene| Monica and Rachel's, the gang, minus Rachel, are getting ready for dinner.]
Joey| Hey, y'know Ross, I think I kinda understand why I kinda lost it today.
Ross| You do, huh?
Joey| Yeah you see umm, well, I'm an actor. Right? So I gotta keep my emotions
right at the surface y'know? See what I'm saying? I gotta lot of balls in the air. (Makes
like he's juggling.) Y'know what I mean? It's tough! Guys like me, y'know, you wander
around, you're alone
Ross| What are you talking about?
Joey| (thinks) I'm not sure.
Rachel| (entering) Hi!
Monica| Hey, look at you! Where have you been?
Rachel| Oh, I went to have pizza. With Danny.
Monica| How did that happen?
Rachel| That yeti is one smooth talker.
Monica| I hope you're not full, 'cause dinner's almost ready.
Rachel| Yeah, y'know I-I think I'm just gonna hang out in my room.
All| No! Why?
Rachel| Come on you guys! Listen, if Emily knew I was here having dinner you
with you she would flip out and you know it. It's okay, I really I don't mind.
Ross| Wait! Wait! Wait! Y'know what? Just stay. Please? It uh It would
really mean a lot to me if you stayed.
Rachel| Ross, I
Joey| RACHEL PLEASE!!! JUST HAVE DINNER WITH US!!!
Rachel| Okay. Okay. Joey, it's okay. Settle down.
Joey| All right, I-I'm sorry. I'm sorry. You see Rach I'm an actor
Ross| Hey! Hey, look! Ugly Naked Guy's back!
Rachel| I haven't seen him in so long!
Phoebe| Oh God, I really missed that fat bastard!
Monica| Wow, this is so weird. I just realized this might be the last time we'll
all be hanging out together.
Joey| It's almost as if he knew.
Monica| I'll get it. (On phone.) Hello. (Listens.) Hi Emily! (Listens.) Yeah, uh
you-you tracked him down. Hold on one second. (She hands the phone to Ross.)
Ross| Hey! (Listens.) Yeah-yeah, we're just having dinner. (Listens.) Uh, yeah,
sure uh hold on. (To the gang.) She wants to say hi. (To Emily) Hold on.
Phoebe| Hi Emily!
Chandler| Hi!
Emily| Hello everyone. So who am I saying hello too?
Joey| Well uh, I don't know about who's here, but I can tell you for damn sure
who's not here and that's Rachel!!
Emily| (laughs) Well, I should hope not. Ross knows better than that by now.
Ross| Y'know what? Uh, Rachel is here! (Rachel stops.)
Emily| She's there?!
Chandler| Oh yeah, there-there she is!
Ross| Yeah, yeah, she's here.
Emily| Ross, take me off speakerphone.
Ross| (on phone) Hi.
Emily| How can you do this too me?! I thought I'd made my feelings about Rachel
perfectly clear!
Ross| (going onto the patio) Look Emily, I'm just having dinner with my friends,
okay?
Emily| You obviously can't keep away from her.
Ross| Emily that's ridiculous. Look, I'm-I'm moving for you, I'm cutting friends
out of my life for you. Please, just get on the plane and come to New York. Okay, you'll
see you're the only person I want to be with.
Emily| I'll feel better when I'm there, and I can know where you are all the
time.
Ross| Well, you can't know where I am all the time. Look, this marriage is never
gonna work if you don't trust me.
Emily| You're right.
Ross| So, can you trust me?
Emily| No.
Joey| I think it's going okay. Looks like he's smiling.
Monica| How can you tell? You can only see the back of his head!
Joey| You can totally tell! Here look, watch me. (He stands up and turns his
back to them so that he is facing the window.) Smile! Frown. Smile! Frown. (The camera
cuts to Ross outside hanging up the phone.) Smile! (Ross turns around and sees Joey
alternately smiling and frowning and just stares at him for a second and heads back
inside.)
Ross| Well, I guess that's it.
All| Why, what happened?
Joey| What happened? What happened?
Ross| My marriage is over.
All| What?!
Monica| Oh, sweetie. Oh, look at you. You're shivering.
Phoebe| Here. (She wraps her coat around his shoulders.)
Rachel| Ross, honey, is there anything we can do?
Ross| Yeah. You can help me get my furniture back from Gunther.
[Scene| A curbside newsstand, Phoebe is whistling and walking up to it wearing her fur
coat. She stops and starts to look through a magazine and notices a squirrel on a nearby
tree chirping at her.]
Phoebe| (to the squirrel) Okay, stop tormenting me! This mink! Okay, they're
mean! And they hate squirrels! And y'know, okay, most of these probably wanted to be
coats! (The squirrel stares at her.) All right, fine, now I get it. (To the clerk.) Here.
(She hands him her coat.) You take it. (To the squirrel.) Are you happy now? I'm cold!
[Scene| Central Perk, Chandler and Joey are there. Joey is looking at a National
Geographic and giggling.]
Chandler| Are you looking at naked tribe's women?
Joey| No, look. (Shows him the magazine.)
Chandler| That's a pig.
Joey| I know, I know, but look at the knobs on her.
Chandler| Hey! (Joey quickly hides the magazine under the couch.)
Ross| Emily's cousin kicked me out!
Chandler| What?!
Joey| Why?
Ross| Well, when you're subletting an apartment from your wife's cousin and then
you get a divorce, sometimes the cousin suddenly wants his apartment back.
Chandler| How can he do that? Didn't you sign a lease?
Ross| Who needs a lease when it's family!
Joey| Hey, you can stay with us! We'll take care of ya!
Chandler| Oh, yeah! Absolutely! Anything you need man! But you have to promise
me the second you are feeling better so that we can make fun of your hair!
Joey| Yeah.
Ross| You got it.
Joey| Okay.
Ross| Thanks you guys, I really appreciate this. All right, I'm gonna get
packing again. Man, I've been moving around so much I'm beginning to feel like a nomad.
Ross| What?
Chandler| He thought you said gonad.
[Scene| Monica's restaurant, she is getting inspected by the health department, Phoebe
is watching.]
Health Inspector|
Monica| Oh, Larry.
Phoebe| Umm, do health inspectors work on commission?
Larry| No, bribes.
Phoebe| It's okay to laugh right?
Larry| Yeah, I was just kidding.
Phoebe| Okay. (She laughs harder.)
Larry| I'll check the kitchen floors.
Monica| Okay, knock yourself out, Larry.
Phoebe| Yum-my!
Monica| Larry?
Phoebe| Oh yeah! I'd let him check out my kitchen floors.
Larry| (entering) A 98. I deducted 2 points because you are not wearing your
chef's hat, and that is a Section 5 violation.
Monica| Uh, look, Larry honey, umm, I wrote the book on Section 5 and I know
that you don't have to wear your hat unless you're in the kitchen.
Larry| And where is your hat?
Monica| It's in the kitchen, I'll go get it.
Larry| Ahh that's the 2 points.
Phoebe| Hey, you should really read that book you wrote. (To Larry) Wow! You saw
the hat in the kitchen and knew that she'd have to go in there hatless to get it.
You can have your own health inspector detective show!
Larry| Oh, I don't know about that.
Phoebe| Yeah, but then I can be you sidekick Vunda.
Larry| Maybe uh, Vunda could give me her number and I can ask her to dinner
sometime.
Phoebe| Okay, she would love that! Y'know, 'cause you know all the clean places
to eat.
Larry| I-I'll call ya.
Phoebe| Okay.
Phoebe| He's so funny! (She imitates what he just did.)
[Scene| Central Perk, Gunther is serving Monica and Rachel.]
Monica| Thanks.
Rachel| Thank you. (To Monica) Mon?
Monica| Hmm?
Rachel| How's Ross doing? Y'know since all the Emily stuff.
Monica| He's not great umm, but he's dealing with it. Oh wait a minute, you're
not gonna try
Rachel| Oh, honey, please, no, I can't get started with all that Ross stuff
again. I mean, he's gonna screwed up for a looong time. And besides y'know, I don't, I
don't go for guys right after they get divorced.
Monica| Right, you only go for them 5 minutes before they get married.
Danny| (To Gunther) Two pounds of Moca Java please.
Monica| (To Monica) Danny. Are you guys ever gonna go out again?
Rachel| I don't know! He hasn't called me since that one time when we went out.
I see him in the hallway, we flirt, I'm all ha-ha-ha-ha, and nothing.
Danny| (To them) Hey!
Rachel| Hi Danny! (Notices his box of liquor he's carrying.) Wow! Thirsty huh?
Danny| Uh, actually, actually, I'm having a party at my place on Saturday, it's
sort of a house warming kind of thing.
Monica| Ohh, fun!
Rachel| Ohh, great!
Danny| Yeah, I'm really looking forward to it.
Rachel| Yeah.
Danny| Okay, see ya. (Heads out.)
Monica| Well, I guess we won't be warming his house.
Rachel| (laughs) Okay. All right, I see what he's doing! He's not asking me out,
because he wants me to ask him out.
Monica| And you're not gonna do that.
Rachel| That's right! 'Cause that would give him the control! So now he's
all ooh, coming up with this whole I've got a party thing y'know, trying to get me to hint
around for an invitation. Blew up in his face, didn't it?
Monica| So-so there is no party.
Rachel| No, there's a party. There's a party. But the power, that is still up
for grabs. You follow me?
Monica| I think so. Se, he-he's not inviting you to his party because he likes
you.
Rachel| Exactly.
[Scene| Chandler and Joey's, they're entering to find boxes strewn about the
apartment.]
Joey| Ross?
Ross| (entering from the bathroom) Hey roomies!
Chandler| Love what you've done with the place.
Ross| Oh, yeah I know, I know, it's a lot of boxes, but again I really
appreciate you guys letting me stay here.
Joey| Not a problem. And listen, hey! Since you're gonna be here for a while,
why don'tI was thinking we uh, put your name on the answering machine.
Chandler| Oh yeah!
Ross| Oh, I uh, hope you don't mind, I kinda uh, jazzed it up a little. Check
this out. (He plays the greeting, and We Will Rock You starts to play and Ross's
voice comes over it.) We will, we will, call you back!
Joey| Hey, all right!
Ross| Pretty cool, huh?
Joey| (To Chandler) You're fake laughing too, right?
Chandler| Oh, the tears are real.
[Scene| A restaurant, Phoebe and Larry are having dinner.]
Larry| You look beautiful this evening.
Phoebe| (smiles) Show me the badge again.
Phoebe| Shiny.
Larry| Oh, will you mind if I wash up? Because I came straight from work and who
knows where these babies (Holds up his hands) have been.
Phoebe| (laughing) You are just nonstop!
Larry| (coming back) We're outta here!
Phoebe| Why?!
Larry| Just walking past the kitchen I saw 10 violations! I'm shutting this
place down!
Phoebe| (awed) You have the power to do that?
Larry| This does. (Shows her his badge.)
Phoebe| (excited) Shut it down.
[Scene| Chandler and Joey's, Chandler is entering. As he closes the door, Joey pokes
his head up from a box enclosure built using the 2 chairs.]
Joey| Hey.
Chandler| What are you doing?
Joey| Nothing.
Chandler| You built a fort didn't ya?
Joey| (smiles) Kinda.
Chandler| (notices something) Oh my God, the air purifier! Ross's air purifier!
All I heard through 4 years of college was (makes a humming noise.)
Joey| Dude, you should've gone out once and a while.
Chandler| I hate this thing!
Joey| Come on, Chandler, Ross is our friend. He needs us right now, so why don't
you be a grown up and come and watch some TV in the fort!
[Scene| Monica and Rachel's, Rachel is opening the door.]
Rachel| Oh, hi Danny.
Danny| Hey guys, I just uh, wanted to invite you to the party tomorrow night.
Monica| Oh, thanks! We'll try to stop by.
Rachel| Uh, actually, I think I'm gonna be busy.
Monica| You are?
Rachel| Yeah! Remember I got that uh, gala.
Danny| Yeah, what's the gala for?
Rachel| It's a uh, regatta gala.
Danny| Really! You-you sail?
Rachel| No-no, but I support it.
Danny| Okay, (To Monica) hope I see you tomorrow night.
Monica| Okay.
Danny| Take care. (Leaves.)
Rachel| Okay. (Closes the door.) Walked right into that one didn't he?
Monica| What one? You wanted him to invite you to the party and he did it!
Rachel| Yeah, but he waited until the last minute! So if I said yes, he would
know I had nothing better to do than wait around for an invitation to his stupid party. I
said, "No!" Which puts me right back in the driver seat.
Monica| Great. So the ball is in his court?
Rachel| Ball? There is no ball.
[Scene| Chandler and Joey's and Ross's, Ross is working on his computer and Joey is
making a lot of noise.]
Ross| (glaring at him) Joey, please! (Motions to his computer.)
Joey| Sorry.
Joey| Ahhhhhhhhhh
Chandler| (entering) Hello children!
Joey| Hey! Wanna play some foosball? Please?
Chandler| Okay. (Starts to head for where the foosball table usually is.)
Joey| No-no, no! We have to move the table into my room, yeah! 'Cause of all the
boxes. Come on!
Joey| All right, I have one question. What is the deal with this?
(Imitates Ross's 'quiet down' maneuver, but does move his hands up and down he just flaps
his hands as if he's waving good-bye.)
Chandler| Bye-bye little puppet Joey hand?
Joey| No, the quiet down thing!
Chandler| You mean this. (Does the maneuver perfectly.)
Joey| Um-hmm! Look, I-I-I don't know how much more of this I can take! Did you
know he taped over my Baywatch tape with some show about bugs! My God! What if that
had been porn?
Chandler| (gasps) All right look, y'know, this maybe tough but come on, this is
Ross! I survived college with him!
Joey| All right, I guess I can hold out a little longer. Let's have a game.
Chandler| Okay.
Chandler| No-no-no-no!
Joey| YES!!
Ross| (entering) Uh fellas, (Does the maneuver and gives them a double thumbs
up, which Chandler returns as he closes the door.)
Chandler| Okay, so he's out of here.
Joey| Um-hmm.
[Scene| Monica and Rachel's, Monica, Rachel, and Phoebe are there.]
Joey| (entering) Hey!
Monica| Hey!
Joey| You guys got anything to eat? I just went down to Johnos for some chicken
and it was closed!
Phoebe| Oh, I took Larry there to eat but it was all violated. So we shut it
down!
Joey| Pheebs, if this guy keeps closing down all of our favorite places, where
are we gonna eat?!
Monica| I don't know, clean places?
Joey| Umm, yum!
Monica| (looking through the peephole) It's Danny.
Rachel| Don't let him in! I'm supposed to be at a regatta gala.
Monica| (to Danny) We'll be right there! (To Rachel) Can't you just say it
starts later?
Rachel| What? What kind of a regatta gala starts at night?!
Monica| The fake kind!
Danny| Hey, hi, I need a ladle. You got a ladle?
Monica| We have a ladle. (Gives him one.)
Danny| Thanks, see you at the party.
Monica| Okay, great!
Phoebe| Hey, guys, you know what Larry would say? He would say, "See you
ladle." (Laughs.)
[Scene| Central Perk, Chandler, Joey, and Ross are there. Chandler and Joey are looking
through the paper.]
Chandler| Well, I-I-I'm done with this. You want anything Ross? Sports?
International? Apartment listings?
Ross| I'll take sports.
Joey| Mine! (He grabs it.)
Ross| All right. Uhh, international.
Joey| Oh that's mine too! (Grabs it and Ross looks at him.) I'm Italian!
Ross| Well, I guess I can check out those apartment listings, even though
there's never anything in here.
Chandler| Not even on page 7?
Ross| (looks) Oh yeah! You'rehey, you're right! Here's an affordable
place, (reading ad) two bedroom, close to work, ooh, it's available in five weeks!
Chandler| What about that circled one?
Ross| Oh, I-I don't know, it's kind of expensive for a studio.
Joey| But it's available now! Isn't it?
Chandler| Yes, it is.
Joey| Hey, let's go look at it! (They both jump up.)
Ross| Okay, let's go.
Joey| Okay!
Chandler| There we go!
Ross| Oh-oh-ooh, hey guys, I was wondering if you guys would uh, maybe chip in
on some new air filters for the air purifier? I mean after all, we all are using it.
Chandler| Let's go quicker.
Joey| Yeah!
[Scene| The apartment in the listing, the guys are checking it out. There's one problem
though, it's roughly the size of this computer screen. As they enter Joey lets out a
whistle.]
Ross| Oh my God! (Looking around, which doesn't take him long.)
Chandler| Yeah, well look at this kitchen, slash bathroom. Well that's great!
Y'know so you can cook while in the tub.
Joey| Somebody was using his head. Hey, let's check out the rest of the place.
Ross| I think this is it. I don't know, maybe we should keep looking.
Joey| But hey, Ross, this place is available now!
Chandler| Yeah, you don't want to be stuck with us for the next five weeks.
Joey| Yeah.
Ross| (To Joey) So, you-you think I should go ahead and take this place?
Joey| Oh, it's perfect!
Ross| (To Chandler) How about you?
Chandler| It's a kitchen slash bathroom.
Ross| All right, I see what you guys are saying. I'll uh, I'll go downstairs and
fill out an application.
Chandler| We are bad people.
Joey| He knew we were trying to get rid of him. He knew! (Pause.) You think we
could get a bathtub in our kitchen?
[Scene| Central Perk, Phoebe is there waiting for Larry.]
Larry| (entering) Hey, ready for dinner?
Phoebe| Ooh, absolutely!
Larry| Great! How about you wanted to go the Italian place down on Bleaker
Street right?
Phoebe| Ooh, I love that place! (Thinks about it.) So, no.
Larry| How about Mama Lisettie's?
Phoebe| Enh. Sure!
Larry| (notices something) I wonder how long that milk (on the counter) has been
setting out.
Phoebe| Oh, no-no, this place is totally healthy! Thatthis milk is mine. I
bought this today, 'cause I was thirsty for milk, y'know. (She takes a swig of it, but has
to turn away from him as she makes a face to show that it has gone bad.) Okay, let's go!
Larry| Hey, buddy! (Flashes his badge.) Are you familiar with Section 11-B of
the Health Code that requires all refuse material out the back exit?
Gunther| But then I'd have to go all the way around the dry cleaner place.
Larry| Oh, so you're saying you'd choose convenience over health?!
Phoebe| Okay, stop! Larry, okay, can't you just be Larry and not Larry the
health inspector guy? Y'know I mean it was really exciting at first but now it's like,
okay, so where are we gonna eat ever?
Larry| Well, I suppose I could give him a warning.
Phoebe| Thank you. (To Gunther, who's standing there frozen) Okay, go! Go! Go!
(He runs off.) (To Larry) Now, if after dinner you still really need to bust someone, I
know a hot dog vendor who picks his nose.
[Scene| Chandler and Joey's, Chandler and Joey are lamenting about how they kicked Ross
out.]
Joey| Maybe, maybe we did a good thing, helping Ross get back on his feet!
Chandler| Yes that was a nice place!
Joey| Yeah!
Chandler| Not a lot of closet space, but he can just hang his stuff out the
window in a bag!
Joey| Yeah!
Chandler| What are we gonna do?
Joey| I don't know. Maybe pizza?
Chandler| About Ross!
Joey| Oh! Oh!
Joey| Hello! (Listens.) Oh yeah! (To Chandler) It's the apartment manager; Ross
put us down as references. (To the apartment manager.) Ross is the greatest guy you'll
ever meet! Yeah, he's very reliable.
Chandler| (grabbing the phone) Of course he has this big huge dog! That uh,
barks into the night. (Listens.) Well, who doesn't love dogs? (Thinks.) Ah, he's a tap
dancer! (Listens.) Yes, some would say that is a lost art. (Thinks.) He's a pimp!
(Listens.) There you go! Yes, he's a pimp. He's a big, tap dancing pimp! (Pause.) Hello?
Chandler| Ohhhhh!
[Scene| Downstairs at Danny's party, Monica and Rachel are coming down the stairs and
Rachel has on a coat to make it look as if she's just getting back. But just as they reach
the landing they see Danny out in the hall talking to a guest, Rachel then quickly pulls
Monica back up the stairs.]
Rachel| Shoot, shoot, this is never gonna work! He's right there!
Monica| Just go over and say hi.
Rachel| No, I have to go downstairs and come back up as if I'm coming home from
the regatta gala. Okay? So just go distract him. But don't be sexy.
Monica| Hey, Danny!
Danny| Hey! What's going on?
Monica| (turns his back to the stairs) Oh, it's a great party! Great food.
Y'know, most parties it's all chips and salsa, chips and salsa. (As she's saying this
Rachel tries to head downstairs but is blocked by people coming upstairs. She quickly
retreats back up the stairs.) (Sees that she has to keep him distracted longer.) So umm,
what's this? (Points to his plate.)
Danny| Salad.
Monica| Ooooh! (Rachel now succeeds in getting downstairs.) And-and-and
what-what's this? (Points again.)
Danny| Bread. Aren't you a chef?
Monica| (upon seeing Rachel she points) Oh.
Danny| Hey! Rachel!
Rachel| Hey! Oh right, tonight was your party.
Danny| Oh wow, you look great! Glad you could make it.
Rachel| Oh well, y'know, the gala had to end sometime.
Danny| Don't go anywhere, I'll be right back. (He heads off.)
Rachel| Yeah, sure. (To Monica) All right, whose court is the ball in now?
Monica| I thought there wasn't a ball?
Rachel| Oh, come on! He's glad that I came, he doesn't want me to go anywhere,
balls flying all over the place!
Danny| (returning, with a friend) Rachel, this is my friend Tom. (To Tom) This
is the girl I told you about.
Rachel| Oh, go on! You telling people about me?
Danny| You two could really hit it off! I'm gonna go mingle. (Leaves.)
Tom| So you work at Bloomingdale's, huh? My mom calls it Bloomies.
Rachel| (laughs) Yeah, okay, at ease solider!
Tom| I'm sorry?
Rachel| No, it's all right, you can just drop the act Tommy. I know what's going
on here. Your Danny's wingman right? You guys are best buds. Frat bros!
Tom| I'm gonna go talk to uh, a friend.
Rachel| Yeah, yeah, you go talk to your friend. You tell him, "Nice
try."
Rachel| Man! He just keeps lobbing them up and I just keep knocking them right
out of the park!
Monica| I think I need a drink.
Rachel| Yeah!
[Scene| Chandler and Joey's, Ross still has boxes all over the place. Joey is wearing a
football helmet, and Chandler is spinning him around in one of the chairs and counting.]
Chandler| 98. 99. 100. Okay, go!
Joey| (getting up) Dude, I'm telling ya! I'm fine! (He tries to take a step and
falls flat on his face.)
Chandler| Here we go! Here we go!
Joey| Hey!
Chandler| Hey!
Ross| Hey. So I uh, I didn't get that apartment. Some problem with my
application.
Joey| You're kidding!
Chandler| You're kidding, no!
Ross| Yeah. But, the good news is that Phoebe said that I could stay at her
place for a while. So
Joey| But you can't stay with Phoebe, Ross! We're-we're roomies!
Ross| Look, you guys don't need me here taking up your space.
Joey| Well, we got plenty of space! There-there's still some over there (Points
to where the window is but sees that there isn't any space there and points towards his
door.) by-by that speaker. Please, just stay!
Chandler| Yeah!
Ross| Are you guys sure about this?
Joey| Definitely!
Chandler| Yes! Ross, you have to stay!
Ross| All right.
Joey| All right!
Chandler| All right, buddy!
Ross| So I'm a pimp huh? It's okay! Look, I know that sometimes I can be a pain
in the ass, but you just have to talk to me. Tell me if something is bothering you. Okay?
And for my part I will do everything I can to keep my annoying habits just (Does the
'quiet down' maneuver).
[Scene| Chandler and Joey's and Ross's, Chandler is entering and when he closes the
door Joey pops his head out of the fort like before, but this time he's wearing a cowboy
hat.]
Chandler| Well, I see you've had a very productive day. Don't you think the
cowboy hat is a little much?
Ross| (popping up behind Joey wearing an Indian headdress) Come on, it's fun!
Chandler| All right! (He joins them in the fort and comes up putting on a
bonnet.) Isn't this a woman's hat?
Joey| Dude, stop talking crazy and make us some tea!
[Scene| Monica and Rachel's, everyone has just finished Thanksgiving dinner and are
groaning over their fullness.]
Rachel| Oh Monica that was the best Thanksgiving dinner ever! I think you
killed us.
Ross| I couldn't possibly eat another bite.
Joey| I need something sweet.
Phoebe| Does anyone wanna watch TV?
All| Yeah, sure.
Phoebe| Monica your remote doesn't work.
Monica| Phoebe, you have to lift it and point.
Phoebe| Oh. Aw, forget it.
Rachel| Yeah, you know what we should all do? We should play that game where
everyone says one thing that they're thankful for.
Joey| Ooh-ooh, I! I am thankful for this beautiful fall we've been having.
Monica| That's very nice.
Chandler| That's sweet, Joey.
[Scene| Monica and Rachel's, continued from earlier. Joey is talking about the wonder
that is the thong.]
Joey| I mean, it's not so much an underpant as it is a feat of engineering. I
mean, it's amazing how much they can do with so little material! And the way they play
with your mind! Is it there? Is it not there?
Chandler| Are you aware that you're still talking?
Monica| Is anyone thankful for anything else besides a thong?
Ross| Huh, I don't know what to pick. Am I more thankful for my divorce or my
eviction? Hmm.
Phoebe| Wow! See, and I didn't think you'd be able to come up with anything.
Ross| I'm sorry. It's just that this is the worse Thanksgiving ever.
Chandler| No-no-no! I am the king of bad Thanksgivings. You can't just
swoop in here with your bad marriage and take that away from me.
Rachel| Oh, you're not gonna tell the whole story about how your parents got
divorced again are you?
Ross| Oh God, no.
Joey| Oh, come on! I wanna hear it! It wouldn't be Thanksgiving without Chandler
bumming us out!
Chandler| It's a tradition, like the parade. If the parade decided it was gay,
moved out, and abandoned its entire family.
[Scene| The Bing household, Mr. and Mrs. Bing and Young Chandler are eating
Thanksgiving dinner as a housekeeper serves them.]
Mrs. Bing| Now Chandler dear, just because your father and I are getting a
divorce it doesn't mean we don't love you. It just means he would rather sleep with the
house-boy than me.
The Housekeeper| More turkey Mr. Chandler? (And he makes eyes at him.)
[Scene| Monica and Rachel's, continued from earlier.]
Ross| You're right. Yours is worse. You are the king of bad Thanksgivings.
Phoebe| I don't know about that. I've got one that's worse.
Chandler| Really? Worse than, "More turkey Mr. Chandler?"
Phoebe| Oh, did the little rich boy have a problem with the butler? Yes, mine's
worse!
[Scene| A Union battlefield hospital, Phoebe, in a past life, is tending to a wounded
Union soldier. (By the way, for historical perspective, 1862 was the second year of the
American Civil War.)]
Past Life Phoebe|
[Scene| Monica and Rachel's, continued from earlier.]
Ross| In this life, Phoebe.
Phoebe| Oh, this life! Oh okay no, Chandler's is worse.
Joey| Man, it must be so cool remembering stuff like that! I don't have any past
life memories.
Phoebe| Of course you don't sweetie. You're brand new.
Rachel| I know Monica's worst Thanksgiving.
Monica| Oh, let's not tell this story.
All| Oh, come on!
Phoebe| Oh no, I know! I know! It's the one where Joey got Monica's turkey stuck
on his head!
Rachel| What?! Joey got a turkey stuck on his head?!
Joey| Hey, it's not like it sounds.
Chandler| It's exactly like it sounds.
[Scene| Monica and Phoebe's, Phoebe is entering.]
Joey| (muffled) Hello?
Phoebe| (surprised) Hello?
Joey| Phoebe?
Phoebe| Joey? What's going on?
Joey| Look. (He walks out of the bathroom with his head stuck in a huge turkey.)
Phoebe| Oh my God!
Joey| I know! It's stuck!!!
Phoebe| (walks him to the kitchen) Easy. Step. How did it get on?
Joey| I put it on to scare Chandler!
Phoebe| Oh my God! Monica's gonna totally freak out!
Joey| Well then help me get it off! Plus, it smells really bad in here.
Phoebe| Well, of course it smells really bad. You have your head up a dead
animal.
Monica| (entering) Hey!
Phoebe| Hey!
Monica| Hey, did you get the turkey bastedOh my God! Oh my God! (She sees
someone is stuck in the turkey.) Who is that?
Joey| It's Joey.
Monica| What-what are you doing? Is this supposed to be funny?
Phoebe| No, it's not supposed to be funny, it's supposed to be scary.
Monica| Well, get it off now!
Joey| I can't! It-it's stuck!
Monica| Well, I don't care! That-that turkey has to feed 20 people at my
parent's house and they're not gonna eat it off your head!
Phoebe| All right, hold on! Okay, let's just all think.
Monica| Okay, I got it. Phoebe? All right, you pull. I'm gonna spread the legs
as wide as I can. (Joey starts giggling.) Joey? Now is not the time!
Joey| Sorry! Sorry.
Monica| Okay, count to three. 1. 2. 3!
Chandler| Arghhhhhh!! (Joey turns around to taunt him, but Chandler is in the
doorway and Joey is facing the kitchen.)
Joey| (pointing) It worked! I scared ya, I knew it! Ha-ha!
Chandler| I'm over here big guy.
Joey| (turning all the way around, and still not facing Chandler) Yeah, you are!
(Starts dancing.) I scared you!
[Scene| Monica and Rachel's, continued from earlier.]
Chandler| (laughing) You did look like an idiot.
Joey| Hey, I wasn't the only one who looked like an idiot. All right? Remember
when Ross tried to say, "Butternut squash?" And it came out, "Squatternut
buash?"
Ross| Yeah that's the same.
Monica| That's it. That's my worse Thanksgiving.
Phoebe| Oh wait! That can't be the one Rachel's talking about. She didn't even
know that happened. So which one was it?
All| Which one?
Monica| Umm, I-I really don't want to tell this story.
Chandler| Oh, come on Monica, reliving past pain and getting depressed is what
Thanksgiving is all about. Y'know, for me anyway. And of course, the Indians.
Monica| Look umm, of all people, you do not want me to tell this story!
[Scene| The Geller household, Mr. and Mrs. Geller are getting ready for Thanksgiving
dinner. The doorbell rings.]
Mrs. Geller| Monica! I think Rachel's here!
Monica| I'll get it! (She runs in, and she's her old fat self like The One With
The Prom Video. Not only that, she's out of breath after running a short distance. She
goes over and opens the door to reveal Rachel with her old nose.) Happy Thanksgiving!
Big Nosed Rachel| Not for me. Chip and I broke up!
Fat Monica| Oh, why? Why? What happened?
Big Nosed Rachel| Well, you know that my parents are out of town and Chip was
going to come over
Fat Monica| Yeah, yeah, and you were going him y'know, your flower.
Big Nosed Rachel| Okay, Monica, can you just call it sex?! It really
creeps me out when you call it that! Okay, and by the way, while we're at it, a guy's
thing is not called his tenderness. Believe me! (Walks into the living room and greets
Monica's parents.) Hi!
Mr. Geller| Hi Rachel!
Big Nosed Rachel| Happy Thanksgiving!
Mrs. Geller| You too sweethart!
Ross| (entering) Hey!
Mr. Geller| Oh my!
Ross| Uh, everyone, this is Chandler! My roommate and lead singer of our band!
Fat Monica| Ross! (Wanting to be introduced.)
Ross| Oh, this is Monica.
Fat Monica| Hi, I'm Ross's little sister.
Chandler| (seeing her) Okay.
Mrs. Geller| I'm so glad you could come Chandler, we've got plenty of food so I
hope you're hungry.
Ross| Oh, mom. Mom. Chandler hates Thanksgiving and doesn't eat any Thanksgiving
food.
Mrs. Geller| Oh, well, I'm so glad you brought him here then.
Fat Monica| Umm, Chandler, if you want I can make you some macaroni and cheese
for dinner.
Chandler| Well, as long as the pilgrims didn't eat it, I'm in.
Fat Monica| dammit! (Runs off.)
Ross| So uh, Rach? Does it, does it feel weird around here now? Y'know since
I've been away at college.
Big Nosed Rachel| Oh! No, not really.
Ross| Well, that's cool. So did (She walks away from him and he shuts up.)
Big Nosed Rachel| Ugh! I cannot believe Chip dumped me for that slut
Nancy Branson. I am never going out with him again. I don't care how much he begs!
Fat Monica| I think his begging days are over now that he's going out with Nancy
Branson.
Big Nosed Rachel| Y'know what? I've just had it with high school boys! They are
just silly. (Ross is overhearing this.) Silly, stupid boys! I'm going to start dating men!
Ross| Umm, I'm sorry Judy, I couldn't find that bowl that you and Jack were
looking for.
Fat Monica| Call them mom and dad you loser!
Ross| (in a high pitched voice) Monica!
Fat Monica| Hey Chandler! Did you like the macaroni and cheese?
Chandler| Oh yeah, it was great. You should be a chef.
Fat Monica| Okay!
Big Nosed Rachel| Guess what?! All that stuff about Nancy Branson being a slut
was all a rumor so Chip dumped her and he wants to come over to my house tonight!
Fat Monica| Oh that's so great!
Big Nosed Rachel| I know!
Fat Monica| Oh gosh, listen if you and Chip do it tonight, promise me you'll
tell me everything.
Big Nosed Rachel| Oh totally, totally. Y'know it's not that big of deal, we
already kinda did it once y'know.
Fat Monica| I know, but y'know, this time you're gonna definitely know
whether or not you did it!
Big Nosed Rachel| I know, I know. And oh, and this time Chip promised
that-that this time it will last at least for an entire song!
Ross| So Im thinking about asking Rachel out tonight. Y'know maybe play
her that song we wrote last week.
Chandler| Emotional Knapsack?
Ross| Yeah.
Chandler| Right on! Oh! Uh, but, dont take to long okay? 'Cause uh, we're
gonna test out our fake ID's tonight, right Clifford Alverez.
Ross| Listen, Roland Chang, if things go well, Im gonna be out with her
all night.
Chandler| Dude, don't do that too me!
Ross| All right, it's cool you can stay here. My parents won't mind.
Chandler| No, it's not that, I just don't want to be stuck here all night with
your fat sister.
Ross| Hey!
Mrs. Geller| (holding two pies) Monica, why don't you finish off these pies? I
don't have any more room left in the fridge.
Fat Monica| No. No, thank you!
Mr. Geller| Well Judy, you did it! She's finally full!
[Scene| Monica and Rachel's, back to the present day.]
Chandler| I called you fat?! I don't even remember that!
Monica| Well, I do.
Chandler| I am so sorry. I really am. I was an idiot back then. I rushed the
stage at a Wham concert for crying out loud!
Phoebe| Oh, I can't believe you called her fat.
Ross| I can't believe you let George Michael slap you.
Chandler| I am really sorry. That is so terrible. I am so, so sorry.
Rachel| Actually, y'know that's not the Thanksgiving I was talking about.
Monica| Yes, it was!
Rachel| No, it wasn't. It was actually the
Monica| (interrupting her) Okay, now Thanksgiving's over, let's get ready for
Christmas. Who wants to go get a Christmas tree?!
Phoebe| Oh, no, I have the cutest Christmas story!
Chandler| We wanna hear Monica's Thanksgiving story!
Phoebe| Fine, all right, mine had a dwarf that got broke in half, but y'know
whatever.
[Scene| The Geller household kitchen, Mrs. Geller is cooking and Rachel, post nose job,
is helping her.]
Mrs. Geller| So Rachel, your mom tells me you changed your major again.
Rachel| Oh, yeah, I had too. There was never any parking by the Psychology
building.
Mr. Geller| (entering) Hi Rachel.
Rachel| Oh hi!
Mr. Geller| Wow, love your new nose!
Mrs. Geller| Jack.
Mr. Geller| What? Dr. Wilson's an artist! He removed my mole cluster. Wanna see?
(He starts to show her as the doorbell rings.)
Mrs. Geller| I'll get it.
Rachel| No, God! Please, let me! (Runs out.)
Rachel| Hey!
Ross| Hey. (To his parents) Happy Thanksgiving!
Mr. Geller| (To Chandler) God, your hair sure is different!
Chandler| Yeah, we were just talking about that. I can't believe how stupid we
used to look. (They both quickly push their sleeves over their elbows.)
Ross| So uh, where's Monica?
Mrs. Geller| She's upstairs. Monica! Come down! Everyone's here! Ross, Rachel,
and the boy who hates Thanksgiving.
Monica| Hi, Chandler.
Chandler| Oh my God!
Monica| What-what's the matter? Is there, is there something on my dress? (She
turns around making sure he gets a good look.)
Chandler| You just, you look so different! Terrific! That dress! That body!
Ross| Dude!
Chandler| Sorry!
Mrs. Geller| Yes, yes Monica is thin. It's wonderful. But what we really want to
hear about is Ross's new girlfriend.
Ross| Oh mom! Okay, umm, her name is Carol. And she's really pretty. And smart.
And uh, she's-she's on the lacrosse team and the golf team. Can you believe it? She plays
for both teams!
Monica| So Chandler, I guess I'll see you at dinner.
Mr. Geller| Dude!
Chandler| Sorry.
Rachel| (entering) Oh-ho, my God! That was so awesome! You totally got him back
for calling you fat! He was just drooling all over you. That must've felt so great!
Monica| Well it didn't!
Rachel| What?!
Monica| Yeah, I mean yeah, I look great. Yeah, I feel great and yeah, my heart
is not in trouble anymore! Blah, blah, blah! Y'know I still don't feel like I got him
back, y'know? I just want to humiliate him. I wanna, I want him to be like naked and then
I'm going to point at him and laugh!
Rachel| Okay, that we may be able to do.
Monica| How?
Rachel| Well guys tend to get naked before they're gonna have sex.
Monica| What?! I mean, I didn't work this hard and-and-and lose all this weight
so that I can give my flower to someone like him!
Rachel| Okay, first of all, if you keep calling it that, no one's gonna ever
take it. Then, second of all you're not actually gonna have sex with him! You're just
gonna make him think that you are.
Monica| Yeah.
Rachel| Yeah.
Monica| And when he's naked I can throw him out in the front yard and lock the
door and all the neighbors will just humiliate him!
Rachel| Then, you will definitely get him back!
Monica| Okay, so how do I make him think I wanna have sex with him?
Rachel| Okay, oh, here's what you do. Just act like everything around you turns
you on.
Monica| What do you mean?
Rachel| Well, like anything can be sexy. Like umm, oh-oh, like this dishtowel!
(She grabs it and starts rubbing it on her cheek.) Ooh, ooh, this feels sooo good against
my cheek! And-and if I feel a little hot, I can just dab myself with it. Or I can bring it
down to my side and bring it through my fingers while I talk to him.
Monica| (excited) I can do that!
Rachel| Yeah? Okay! Good, good, because he's coming. He's coming. (To Chandler)
Hey, what's up? (She leaves and closes the door behind her.)
Chandler| Monica, I was wondering if you can make me some of that righteous mac
and cheese like last year.
Monica| Umm, I'd love too! (She goes over and picks up the box and decides to
follow Rachel's advice and holds the box up to her cheek.) Ooh, I love macaroni and
cheese. I love-I love the way this box feels against my cheek.
Chandler| Okay.
Monica| Boy, I love carrots! Oh! (She picks up a bunch of them and holds them
between her fingers.) Sometimes I like to put them between my fingers like this and-and
hold them down here while I talk to you. (She is rubbing her hip with the carrots.) Umm,
and-and-and y'know if I get really hot umm, I-I like to pick up this knife (She picks up a
knife without putting the box down. She's holding the box between her cheek and shoulder)
and-and umm, I-I put the cold steal against umm, (Pause) my body. (She doesn't have any
exposed skin within reach of the knife, so while holding the carrots in one hand and the
box between her face and shoulder, she rubs the knife on her stomach.)
Chandler| Are you all right?
Monica| Oh yeah, of course. I'm fine it's just that(She drops the box and
in a reflex action tries to catch it with her arm, the knife slips out and slowly flips
through the air and comes point first down into Chandler's shoe.)
[Scene| The hospital, Chandler has been rushed to the emergency room.]
The Doctor| What do we got here?
The Paramedic| Twenty year old has got a severed toe on his right foot.
Ross| Can you please not do that feet first? You know where his injury is!
Severed toe, you just said it!
The Doctor| It says here that the knife went right through your shoe.
Mr. Geller| Of course it did. They're made of wicker.
The Doctor| Did you bring the toe?
Monica| Oh yes! I have it right here, on ice! (She takes a bag of ice out of her
purse and hands it to the doctor.)
The Doctor| (opening it) Don't worry son, we'll just attach it and(Stops
suddenly.)
Monica| What?! What is it?
The Doctor| You brought a carrot.
Chandler| What?
The Doctor| This isn't your toe, this is a small, very cold piece of carrot.
Rachel| You brought a carrot?!
Mrs. Geller| Oh my God! There's a toe in my kitchen.
Monica| God, I'm sorry! I'll go back and get it!
The Doctor| It's too late, all we can do now is sow up the wound.
Chandler| Without my toe?! I need my toe!
Monica| Wait, no-no-no, I can go really fast! Dad, give me the keys to your Porsche!
Mr. Geller| Oh, I'm not falling for that one!
[Scene| Monica and Rachel's, Chandler is reacting to the story.]
Chandler| That's why I lost my toe?! Because I called you fat?!
Monica| I didn't mean to cut it off. It was an accident.
Chandler| That's why for an entire year people called me Sir Limps-A-Lot?!
Monica| I'm sorry! It wasn't your whole toe!
Chandler| Yeah, well, I miss the tip! It's the best part. It has the nail. (He
storms out.)
Monica| Chandler! (Follows him out.)
Ross| (To Joey) Sir Limps-A-Lot, I came up with that.
Joey| You're a dork.
Chandler| I can't believe this.
Monica| Chandler, I said I was sorry.
Chandler| Yeah, well, sorry doesnt bring back the little piggy that cried
all the way home! I hate this stupid day! And everything about it! I'll see you
later.
Monica| Oh wait, Chandler, come here is there anything I can do? Anything?
Chandler| Yeah, just leave me alone for a while. (He goes into his apartment.)
[Scene| Chandler, Joey, and Ross's, Chandler is sitting on one of the chairs and the
duck is running around him and quacking.]
Chandler| Oh-oh, I'm a duck! I go, "Quack, quack!" Im happy all
the time!
Chandler| Nice try.
Monica| Wait, wait, wait! (She puts a Shriner's hat on the turkey.)
Chandler| Look, Monica
Monica| Look! (She puts a big, yellow pair of sunglasses on the bird.)
Chandler| This is not going to work.
Monica| I bet this will work! (She starts dancing and Chandler cracks up.)
Chandler| You are so great! I love you!
Monica| What?
Chandler| Nothing! I said, I said "You're so great" and then I just, I
just stopped talking!
Monica| You said you loved me! I can't believe this!
Chandler| No I didn't!
Monica| Yes, you did!
Chandler| No I didn't!
Monica| You love me!
Chandler| No I don't! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!
[Scene| The Western front during World War I, Phoebe, in yet another past life, is once
again a nurse tending to yet another dying soldier. But this time she's doing it with a
French accent.]
French Phoebe|
[Scene| Monica and Rachel's, the entire gang is there, eating breakfast. Phoebe is on
the couch, fidgeting.]
Phoebe| What am I sitting on?
Chandler| Top of the world? Dock of the bay? (He tries to think of another but
can't) I'm out.
Phoebe| (taking something out of the couch) Ew-eww!! Undies!
Rachel| All right! Who's are they? Who's are they?
Ross| Well, they're not mine!
Chandler| Well, they're Joey's! They gotta be Joey's!
Joey| Yeah, they're mine.
Chandler| See? They're Joey's! J-J-J-J-J-Joey's!
Ross| Why are they here?
Joey| I don't know uhh (Pause as he thinks about it.) Well, I'm Joey.
Yeah, I'm disgusting, I take my underwear off in other people's homes.
Rachel| Well, get 'em out of here! What's wrong with you?
Chandler| Yeah!
Monica| Yeah!
Rachel| (waving them in his face) Take 'em! (Joey makes a noise and jumps out of
the way.) Joey, you can touch them! They're your underwear.
Joey| (reluctantly taking them) Chandler? A word.
Joey| That's it! I'm tired of covering for you two! This has got to stop!
(Realizes he still has the underwear in his hand.) Ahh! (Throws them towards Chandler's
room.) And tighty-whiteys! What are you, 8?
Monica| (entering) Thank you Joey, thank you so much!
Joey| Oh hey, no, you're not welcome. Okay, look, I hate this! You guys keep
embarrassing me! (To Monica) Yesterday, Rachel found your razor in our bathroom and I
didn't know what to say, so I said it was mine and-and that I was playing a woman in a
play. And one thing led to another and (He puts his leg on the chair and pulls up his
pants leg to reveal that he now has shaved legs.)
Monica| (inspecting his leg) Wow! And around the ankles, y'know that is a tough
spot.
Joey| Yeah, it was! All right, listen, I can't
Chandler| (interrupting him) All this lying has been hard on us too.
Joey| Oh-oh, yeah-yeah, I bet all the sex makes it easier!
Chandler| Well, yeah actually.
Monica| We'll try to be more careful okay? It's just that, we don't want
everyone to know because this is going really well, and maybe the reason it's going really
well is because it's a secret.
Chandler| I know it sounds really weird, but we're just so bad at relationships.
Monica| We are! Help us!
Chandler| Help!
Joey| All right! But, (To Monica) you do it with me once.
Monica| Joey!
Joey| Didn't think so.
[Scene| Central Perk, Joey, Chandler, Monica, and Rachel are there as Phoebe enters
with her nose stuck in a book.]
Monica| Hey, Phoebe!
Chandler| Hi, Pheebs!
Rachel| Hey, Pheebs!
Joey| Hey, Pheebs!
Rachel| What are you reading?
Phoebe| Umm, Wethering Heights. I'm taking a literature class at the New
School and I have to finish it for the first session tomorrow.
Chandler| I didn't know you were taking a class. That is so cool.
Phoebe| Yeah! Well, I really liked that Lamaze class I took! Y'know and this
time I thought I'd go for something, y'know a little more intellectual, with a less
painful final exam.
Rachel| Honey that sounds like fun.
Phoebe| Yeah! Ooh, you should come with me! Oh yeah, then I'd have someone to
sit with!
Rachel| Okay.
Phoebe| Yeah! Okayooh, but are you going to have time to read it?
Rachel| Oh, I read that in high school.
Phoebe| This is going to be so much fun! Okay-shhh, I have to finish.
Ross| (entering, depressed) Hi.
Joey| What's wrong buddy?
Ross| Someone at work ate my sandwich!
Chandler| Well, what did the police say?
Ross| My Thanksgiving leftover sandwich. I can't believe someone ate it!
Chandler| Ross, it's just a sandwich!
Ross| Just a sandwich? Look, I am 30 years old, I'm about to be divorced twice
and I just got evicted! That sandwich was the only good thing going on in my life! Someone
ate the only good thing going on in my life!
Monica| Okay, look, I-I have enough stuff for one more sandwich, I mean I was
going to eat it myself, but (motions that he can have it.)
Ross| (quietly) That-that would be incredible. Thank you so much. I-I still
can't believe someone ate it!! I mean, look, I left a note and everything.
Chandler| (reading) Knock-knock. Who's there? Ross Geller's lunch. Ross Geller's
lunch, who? Ross Geller's lunch, please don't take me. Okay?
Joey| I'm surprised you didn't go home wearing your lunch.
Phoebe| Okay, look you wanna hold onto your food? You gotta scare people off. I
learned that living on the street.
Ross| Really?! So what would you say Pheebs? Stuff like uh, "Keep your
mitts off my grub?"
Chandler| Say Ross, when you picture Phoebe living on the street, is she
surrounded by the entire cast of Annie?
Phoebe| Okay, this will keep them away from your stuff. (Writes him a note and
the gang reads it.)
All| Whoa! Ohh!!
Monica| Phoebe, you are a bad ass!
Phoebe| Someday I'll, tell you about the time I stabbed the cop.
Monica| Phoebe?
Phoebe| Well, he stabbed me first!!
[Scene| Phoebe's class, the class has already started and Rachel walks in late.]
Rachel| (To Phoebe) Sorry I'm late, but I left late.
Phoebe| Okay.
Rachel| So Pheebs, what is the book about?
Phoebe| I thought you said you read it in high school.
Rachel| Well yeah, but then I remembered I started it and there was this pep
rally and I was, I was on top of the pyramid but anywayumm, what is this book about?
Phoebe| Okay, umm, it's this tragic love story between Cathy and Heathcliff and
umm, it takes place on like these really creepy mores in England. Which I think
represents the wildness of Heathcliff's character. I totally get symbolism.
The Teacher| How would you characterize the theme of this book, uh let's see
here (looks at his attendance sheet), Rachel Green?
Rachel| Umm, well I would have to say that it's a, it's tragic love story.
The Teacher| Well, that's sort of a given, but yes. Anyone else?
Rachel| Oh-oh-oh, symbolism! And uh, the-the uh, wildness of the mores, which I
think is-is mirrored in the wildness of Heathcliff's character.
The Teacher| Excellent! What Rachel has shrewdly observed here
Phoebe| (To Rachel) You completely stole my answer!
Rachel| Well, honey that was pretty obvious.
Phoebe| Well how would you know?! You didn't even read it!
The Teacher| What do you think? You in the blue shirt.
Phoebe| I think that uh, yours is a question with many answers.
The Teacher| Would ya care to venture one?
Phoebe| Would you care to venture one?
The Teacher| Are you just repeating what I'm saying?
Phoebe| Are you just repeating what I'm saying?
The Teacher| All right, let's move on.
Phoebe| Okay then.
[Scene| Central Perk, Monica is there as Phoebe and Rachel return from the class.]
Phoebe| Yeah but why didn't you just say that you didn't read the book?!
Rachel| Be-because I didn't want him to think I was stupid! I mean, that was
really embarrassing what happened to you!
Ross| (entering) Phoebe!
Phoebe| Yeah?
Ross| Phoebe! You're note, amazing! Not only did no one touch my sandwich, but
people at work are actually afraid of me. Yeah, a guy called me mental! Mental Geller,
yeah, I always wanted a cool nickname like that.
Monica| Yeah, the best you got in high school was Wet Pants Geller.
Ross| That was the water fountain! Okay?! Anyway, people are writing reports for
me, uh pushing back deadlines to meet my schedule, I'm telling you, you get tough with
people you can get anything you want. (Joey walks by with a cup of coffee.) Hey Tribbiani,
give me that coffee! Now!
[Scene| The hallway, Joey is returning from a date with Cynthia.]
Cynthia| God, this was really fun! I've been wondering if you were going to ask
me out.
Joey| So you uh, still wondering?
Cynthia| No, we just went out.
Joey| You're smart. I like that.
Cynthia| Oh, candles! (Notices something.) What is that? A blanket? A video
camera? Oh my God! (As she storms out, Rachel returns and overhears the conversation.)
Joey| Oh no-no-no-no, wait-wait-wait!!
Cynthia| I can't believe you thought that you were going to video tape us having
sex on the first date! (She storms away and Rachel enters to confront Joey.)
Joey| Hiya.
Rachel| Joey, is what she just said ummOh my God. (Looks around the room.)
You were actually gonna (Chandler picks this moment to return to the living room.)
(Rachel stares in shock.)
Chandler| What is going on here?
Rachel| And with Chandler in the next room. What are you, what are you sick?
Joey| I'm Joey. I mean, I'm disgusting. I make low-budget adult films. (Points
at Chandler, angrily.)
[Scene| Chandler, Joey, and Ross's; continued from earlier. Joey is closing the door
after Rachel leaves and is about to confront Chandler and Monica.]
Joey| You guys promised you'd be more careful! I mean, come on! The good
Joey name is being dragged through the mud here!
Monica| We're so sorry.
Chandler| Yeah.
Joey| Well, I'm telling everyone about you! That's the only way to explain the
underwear and the video camera that doesn't make me look like a pig!
Chandler| No-no, wait! There's got to be a better explanation. You can tell them
you had to make an adult film for your (Thinks) adult film class.
Joey| Yeah, I like that. But no-no, how does that explain why Rachel found my
underwear at your place?
Chandler| OhI don't know.
Joey| Well, get ready to come out of the non-gay closet!
Monica| Okay, just wait, please. I promise we'll come up with something. Just
give us a little more time.
Joey| All right. Hey, but it better make me look really, really good. (Starts
for his room.) Oh, and another thing, the video camera? Nice!!
[Scene| The Museum of Prehistoric History (Ross's work); Ross is in the break room
eating lunch as his boss, Dr. Leedbetter walks in.]
Dr. Leedbetter| Umm, Ross. May I have a word with you?
Ross| Yeah, of course, Donald.
Dr. Leedbetter| We've been getting reports of some very angry behavior on your
part.
Ross| What?!
Dr. Leedbetter| Threatening letters, refusal to meet deadlines, apparently
people now call you mental.
Ross| (Proudly) Yeah.
Dr. Leedbetter| We want you to speak to a psychiatrist.
Ross| Oh no, you-you don't understand. Ugh, this is so silly. Umm, this is all
because of a sandwich.
Dr. Leedbetter| (laughs) A sandwich?
Ross| Yeah. You see my-my sister makes these amazing turkey sandwiches. Her
secret is, she puts a, an extra slice of gravy soaked bread in the middle; I call it the
Moist Maker. Anyway, I-I put my sandwich in the fridge over here
Dr. Leedbetter| (laughs) Oh, you know what?
Ross| What?
Dr. Leedbetter| I-I'm sorry. I, I-I-I believe I ate that.
Ross| You ate my sandwich?
Dr. Leedbetter| It was a simple mistake. It could happen to anyone.
Ross| (getting upset) Oh-oh really? Did you confuse it with your own turkey
sandwich with a Moist Maker?
Dr. Leedbetter| No.
Ross| Do you perhaps seeing a note on top of it?
Dr. Leedbetter| There may have been a-a joke or a limerick of some kind.
Ross| (getting angry) That said it was my sandwich?!
Dr. Leedbetter| Now-now calm down. Come look in my office, some of it my still
be in the trash.
Ross| (jumping to his feet in anger) What?
Dr. Leedbetter| Well, it was quite large. I-I-I-I-I had to throw most of it
away.
Ross| You-you-you-you (trying to remain in control) threw my sandwich away!
Ross| (losing control, we hear him shout outside) MY SANDWICH?!!!
Ross| MY SANDWICH!!!!!! (Ross's scream scares a flight of pigeons away.)
[Scene| Phoebe and Rachel's class; Rachel walks in, on time this time.]
Rachel| Hi!
Phoebe| Hi!
Rachel| (sitting down) So umm, what's this book about?
Phoebe| You didn't read this one either?!
Rachel| Well, I was gonna, but I accidentally read something else.
Phoebe| What?
Rachel| Vogue! Hey, so tell me about this Jane Eyre woman.
Phoebe| No! You should've read it yourself!
Rachel| Come on Phoebe! Dont be such a goodie-goodie!
Phoebe| Fine! Okay, all right, so Jane Eyre, first of all, you'd think she's a
woman, but she's not. She's a cyborg.
Rachel| A cyborg?! Isn't that like a robot?!
Phoebe| Yeah, this book was light years ahead of its time.
The Teacher| (entering) Sorry I'm late. Let's get started. So, what did
everybody think about Jane Eyre?
Phoebe| Umm, Rachel and I were just discussing it and she had some very
interesting insights.
The Teacher| Well, go ahead Rachel.
Rachel| Uh, thank you Phoebe. Umm, well, what struck me most when reading Jane
Eyre was uh, how the book was so ahead of its time.
The Teacher| If you're talking about feminism, I think you're right.
Rachel| Yeah, well, feminism yes, but also the robots.
[Scene| Central Perk, Chandler is on the couch as Monica joins him.]
Chandler| Hey.
Monica| Hey. Okay, so umm, since that video camera thing didn't work out uh, I
thought that I would give you just a little preview. (Hands him a Polaroid.)
Chandler| (gasps) You're naked in this picture!
Monica| I know.
Chandler| Ross?
Ross| (in a stupor) Hey Chandler. (Sees Monica.) Monica!
Monica| Ross, are you okay?
Ross| I'm fine! I saw a psychiatrist at work today.
Monica| Why?!
Ross| On account of my rage.
Chandler| Which I may say, right now, is out of control.
Ross| He gave me a pill for it.
Monica| A pill?
Ross| Uh-huh. Well, when the psychiatrist told me I had to take a leave of
absence because I yelled at my boss I started to get worked up again, so he offered me a
tranquilizer. And I thought was a good idea so, I took it.
Monica| Wait a minute, they're making you take time off work?
Chandler| And you're okay with that?
Ross| I don't know. It's going to be weird not having a job for a while, but I,
I definitely don't care about my sandwich.
[Scene| Monica and Rachel's, Rachel and Phoebe are returning from class.]
Rachel| (entering, angrily) Ugh, that was so embarrassing! I can't believe you
let me go on and on like that!
Phoebe| (smiling) I'm sorry. It was just so funny when you started comparing Jane
Eyre to Robocop.
Rachel| That was not funny!
Phoebe| Well, I snapped! Okay? You weren't taking the class seriously.
Rachel| Phoebe, come on! What is the big deal? I thought this was going to be
something we could do together! Y'know, I thought it would be fun!
Phoebe| Well, yeah! Fun is good, but y'know I also wanted to learn. Y'know,
people are always talking about what they learned in high school and I never went to high
school.
Rachel| Ohh. Oh, so you really wanted to learn. Yeah, y'know, Pheebs I just
wanted to have fun. Ohh, you know who you should go with?
[Scene| The Class; Monica has taken Rachel's spot.]
Monica| (yelling and waving her hand in the air) I know! I know! I know!
The Teacher| Monica, you asked the question.
[Scene| Chandler, Joey, and Ross's; Joey returns carrying a bucket of chicken, and
starts going through the mail. While doing this, Monica's picture falls out. He bends over
to pick it up and gasps. While he's staring at the picture, Rachel decides to come over
and sees him looking at the picture.]
Rachel| (sees the picture) Oh my God! That's Monica!!
Joey| Oh no-no-no! No-no-no-no-no-no-no!
Rachel| You get away from me!! You sick, sick, sick, sick-o!!
Ross| (entering, with the rest of the gang) What's going on?
Rachel| Joey has got a secret peephole!
Chandler| (Sees the picture) Oh no! No! No! No! (Monica gasps as well.)
Rachel| Yes! He has a naked picture of Monica! He takes naked pictures of us!
And then he eats chicken and looks at them!
Rachel| Look! (Shows Ross the picture.)
Ross| (covering his eyes) Dude! That's my sister! (She shows the rest of the
gang.)
Monica| (grabbing the picture) Give me that!
Phoebe| All right, wait! Just wait. Everybody just calm down. Okay? Let's give
our friend Joey a chance to explain why he's such a big pervert!
Joey| No! I am not a pervert! Okay? It's just I just
Kinda
Chandler| All right, look! Look. I think I can explain this.
Joey| Thank you!
Chandler| Joey's a sex addict.
Joey| What?!! (He turns around and stares at Chandler who's silently pleading
with Joey to go along with it.) No I'm not!!
Monica| It's okay! It's good! It's good. It's a disease!
Joey| No! No! I am not a sex addict!
Monica| Yes you are! That's the only way to explain all this stuff!
Joey| No it isn't! No, it's not. Because you can also explain it with the truth!
Rachel| Well, what is the truth?
Ross| Yeah, what's going on?
Phoebe| What's going on?
Joey| (thinking) I slept with Monica.
Chandler| Well let's.let's see what everybody thinks of that?
Monica| Oh no!
Ross| You slept with my sister?
Joey| Uh yes, but it was, we just did it once uh, in London.
Ross| This is not good for my rage. (Takes another pill.)
Rachel| Monica, is this true?
Joey| Of course it's true! How else would you explain all the weird stuff that's
been going on?
Monica| Yes it's true.
Rachel| Okay, but if it only happened that one time, how come we found your
underwear in our apartment the other day?
Joey| Ahhoy! That was the underwear I was wearing that night in London.
Right Monica?
Monica| I guess I wanted to keep it (Pause) as a souvenir.
Ross| My God Monica!!
Chandler| Are you sure Joe? Are you sure you're not just a sex addict?
Joey| No! If anyone's a sex addict here, it's Monica! Yeah. Yeah. She has been
trying to get me back in the sack ever since London!
Phoebe| So that's why she gave you a naked picture of herself.
Joey| That makes sense!
Rachel| And the video camera?
Joey| Uhh, Monica?
Monica| I guess I set up the video camera to try and entice Joey.
Joey| But sadly I could not be enticed.
Ross| Unbelievable! I mean you really kept Joey's underwear?! Why? Why would you
do that?!
Monica| I'm Monica. I'm disgusting. I stalk guys and keep their underpants.
Joey| Well, I think we've all learned something about who's disgusting and who's
not. Eh? All right, now, I'm going to get back to my bucket. I'm only eating the skin, so
the chicken's up for grabs. (Offers it to everyone.)
[Scene| Monica and Phoebe's class; the class has ended and Phoebe is talking to one of
her classmates.]
Phoebe| I really thought you making a good point. I mean y'know, until you got
cut off.
A Female Student| Yeah, what's up with that girl Monica?
Phoebe| I don't know! I didn't come with her!
Monica| (entering, happily) All right everybody! Everybody guess what? I just
convinced Paul to give us a test next week!
All| A test?!!
Monica| Come on! Tests make us all better learners! Oh yeah! (Running out) We
should have essay questions!!

Phoebe| Wow!
Phoebe| Is that a new Swede jacket? It looks really expensive.
Monica| Yeah. I guess. (She puts more money in the bucket.)
Phoebe| Just get your nails done?
Monica| Yes Phoebe, but this is all I have. Okay? (She pours out the rest of her
change purse into the bucket.)
Phoebe| Okay! Thanks! Happy Holidays, here's your joy. (She waves her arm and
spreads her joy.)
Phoebe| Thank you! And Happy Holidays.
Phoebe| Wait, you can't take the money out.
The Man| I'm making change. I need change for the bus.
Phoebe| But, can't you leave the dollar? This money is for the poor.
The Man| I'm poor! I gotta take the bus!
Phoebe| Okay, Seasons Greetings and everything, but still
The Man| Bite me, blondie! (The man storms off.)
Phoebe| Oh, I'm going to give him something else besides joy, just (She
scowls at him.)
[Scene| Chandler, Joey, and Ross's, Joey is telling Ross how he didn't get the part.]
Joey| That part was perfect for me! I can't believe I didn't get it!
Ross| I'm sorry, man. Hey, y'know what you should do? You should make something
happen for yourself. Y'know, like-like write a play. Write a movie! Huh? I mean, what
about those Good Will Hunting guys?
Joey| Come on Ross be realistic, y'know? If I did write something, what are the
chances I could get those guys to star in it?
Joey| Wait a second, I could star in it!
Ross| Or that.
Joey| I can't write! Y'know I mean I-I-I'm an actor, I don't have the discipline
that takes, y'know? I can't do it.
Ross| I'll help you. Yeah, I'll make up a schedule and make sure you stick to
it. And plus, it'll give me something to do.
Joey| Really? You'd-you'd do that for me?!
Ross| Yeah!
Joey| Thanks!
Ross| (grabbing a notepad and sitting down) All right, we'll start off slow. The
only thing you have to do tonight is come up with the name of your main character.
Joey| Done!
Ross| And it can't be Joey.
Joey| It's not.
Ross| Or Joseph.
Joey| (disappointed) Oh.
[Scene| Monica and Rachel's, Rachel is returning. Monica enters from her room wearing
nothing but a robe.]
Monica| Hey, what's up?
Rachel| I just saw Danny getting on the subway with a girl and he had his arm
around her.
Monica| Oh, honey, I'm sorry.
Rachel| Well, you should be, this is all your fault! You meddled in our
relationship!!
Monica| You had no relationship!!
Rachel| No, but I was doing my thing and everything was going according to the
plan!
Monica| Oh God, stop with the plan! So what, so what you saw him with a girl?
Who cares?! That doesn't mean anything! Now look, you're going to go out on a date with
Danny and you're going to be so charming he's gonna forget all about that stupid subway
girl.
Rachel| She was kinda stupid. You're right. All right, I'm just gonna go on the
date. I'm gonna go on the date. That is the new plan.
Monica| Come on, hurry!
[Scene| Chandler, Joey, and Ross's, Joey is trying to write his movie, Chandler is
playing a game on the counter by trying to flip a ping pong ball with a spoon into a
nearby bowl.]
Joey| Hey, how do you spell suspicious?
Chandler| Why?
Joey| Because I think this character is going to be suspicious about stuff.
Chandler| Yes! Chandler Bing, 7! Chandler Bing, 0.
Joey| You're driving me crazy with that!
Chandler| Okay, I'll stop.
Joey| Dont stop! Move the bowl further away! Ross could make that shot!
Joey| Well, you suck! But at least you suck at a man's game now.
Chandler| You wanna play?
Joey| Chandler, I can't be playing games, Ross is gonna be home soon. And I have
to write five whole pages if I'm gonna stick to his schedule.
Chandler| Well, so, play for the next 30 minutes and then write until he gets
home.
Joey| (jumping up) All right! But uh, listen, what do you say we crank it up a
notch?
Chandler| I'm intrigued.
Joey| All right, all we need is a little lighter fluid.
Chandler| Okay, but be careful okay, because I wanna get our security deposit
back.
Joey| Yeah, I think we said good-bye to that when we invented hammer darts.
Chandler| Do you even remember which part of the wall is not spackle?
Joey| Uh yeah, right here. (He punches his fist through the wall next to the
door.)
[Scene| In front of Macys, Phoebe is still ringing her bell. A guy puts some
change into the bucket.]
Phoebe| Thank you, Happy Holidays.
Phoebe| Now, that's trash. Young lady, you can't (The lady ignores her and
walks off.) Hey! Stop that young lady, she donated trash!
Phoebe| Hey!! (The bucket starts smoking.) The charity's on fire! Help! (Yet
another guy walks by carrying a cup, which Phoebe grabs.) Oh good! Thank you, I need that.
(She throws onto the smoldering fire. Suddenly the bucket erupts in flames.) Whoa! What is
that?! (She sniffs the cup.) (To the guy.) It's nine o'clock in the morning!
[Scene| Chandler, Joey, and Ross's, Ross is reading what Joey wrote.]
Ross| All right. (Reading.) A room. A man enters, he looks suspicious. (Stops
reading a flips the page to find the next one is blank.) That's it? (Joey shrugs.) Joey,
you're supposed to have five pages done by now! Including an exciting incident!
(Flipping through the rest of the pad.) And what is, and what is all this?! (Reading.) The
official rulebook of Fireball.
Joey| Yeah, that's the uh, game we were playing.
Chandler| (entering from his room carrying a fire extinguisher and wearing oven
mitts) Oh yeah, it's great! See you take a tennis ball, a bowl, and some lighter
fluidOp! Op! (He puts out a small fire which has re-ignited in his room.)
Ross| This is helping your career?! Huh? I thought you wanted to be an actor not
the creator of crazy lawsuit game!
Joey| You're right, you're right, I'll get back to work.
Ross| (To Chandler) And shame on you! You should know better, Joey needs to
work. (To Joey) Now come on!
Joey| Hey!
Ross| No! Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah! You can have this back when the five pages are done!
(After Joey walks past, Ross throws the ball down in pain.) Ahh! (Chandler shows him the
burn spots on his oven mitts.)
[Scene| Outside Danny's apartment, Danny and Rachel are returning from their date.]
Danny| I had a really nice time tonight.
Rachel| So did I. I'm really glad Monica asked us out.
Danny| I'd love to ask you in, but uh, my sister's visiting and I think she's
asleep on the couch.
Rachel| You're sister? You're sister's asleep on the couch? (Danny nods,
"Yes.") Ohhh! I saw her with you on the subway and now she's asleep on
the couch!
Danny's Sister|
Danny| Oh hey, great, you're up. Rachel, this is my sister Krista. Krista, this
is Rachel.
Rachel| Hi!
Krista| Nice to meet you. I wish you'd told me we were having company, I'd fix
myself up!
Danny| Like it would help.
Krista| You are so bad! (Hits him softly.)
Danny| You are! (Hits her back.)
Krista| You are! (Hits him softly.)
Danny| You are! (Hits her back.)
Krista| You are! (Hits him softly.)
Danny| You are! (Hits her back.)
Krista| You are! (Hits him harder this time.)
Danny| You are so dead! I'm gonna get you.
Rachel| (not sure what to do) Uh, it was very nice meeting you. (They continue
to ignore her.)
[Scene| Monica and Rachel's, Phoebe is complaining to Ross and Monica about the
bucket.]
Phoebe| Nobody! Nobody respects the bucket! You wouldn't believe what people put
in here! Look! (Hands it to Monica.) Okay, does this look like a garbage can to you?
Monica| No.
Phoebe| Does it look like an ashtray?
Monica| No.
Phoebe| Does it look like a urinal?
Monica| Eww!! (Throws the bucket down.)
Ross| So Pheebs, are you gonna go back out there or what?
Phoebe| Well, yeah! But I'm not gonna take anymore crap. Okay? No more Mrs. Nice
Bucket!
Monica| Yeah, good for you. Y'know you're tough, you lived on the streets.
Phoebe| Yeah, I'm gonna go back to being Street Phoebe. Yeah! Oh but, y'know
what? I can't go totally back because Street Phoebe really wouldn't be friends with you
guys. Sorry. (Leaves.)
Rachel| (entering from her room) Hey!
Monica| Hey!
Rachel| Hey, umm, can I ask you guys something?
Monica and Ross|
Rachel| Uh, I don't have any brothers so I don't know, but uh, did you guys
wrestle?
Ross| Oh-oh, yeah.
Monica| All the time. In fact, I was undefeated.
Ross| Uh, you weighted 200 pounds.
Monica| Still, I was quick as a cat.
Rachel| Well, I met Danny's sister yesterday, and uh that was actually the girl
on the subway.
Monica| Oh, you're kidding.
Rachel| Yeah, they were very y'knowwrestley. But, I guess that's normal?
Monica| (laughing with Ross) We don't, we don't wrestle now.
Ross| Yeah, not since I got too strong for you.
Monica| Too strong for me?
Ross| Yeah.
Monica| You wanna go right now? 'Cause I'll take you right now, buddy! You wanna
go?
Ross| Oh fine.
Monica| Ready? (They grab a hold of each other's necks.) Wrestle! (They start
wrestling.)
Rachel| Okay, y'know what uh, actually, that's great. That helps a lot. Thanks.
(She leaves them to wrestle.)
[Scene| Chandler, Joey, and Ross's, Ross is cleaning the foosball table, Joey is
working on his script.]
Chandler| (entering from his bedroom) Guys, come on! Let's go! The puck drops in
20 minutes! Come on, Joe!
Ross| Joey's not going.
Joey| (To Chandler) I didn't finish my five pages.
Chandler| Well, why can't you do them tomorrow?
Ross| Because tomorrow he's redoing yesterday's pages.
Joey| Yesterday's pages did not reflect my best work.
Chandler| (To Ross) Why don't you cut him a little slack? Okay? Maybe if he
relaxes a little bit, he'll get some work done.
Ross| I think he's been relaxing enough, thanks to you and Fireball.
Joey| Dude, if you think Fireball's relaxing, you've obviously have never
played.
Chandler| The only reason you're doing this to Joey is because you're bored.
Okay, it's not his fault that you're unemployed.
Ross| I am not unemployed. I'm on sabbatical!
Joey| Come on look guys, don't fight.
Ross| And the reason I'm doing this is because I am Joey's friend. And if
you were a good friend, you'd be doing the same thing.
Chandler| Oh, so being a good friend means acting like a total jerk?
Ross| If it does? Then you're an amazing friend of mine.
Joey| Hey-hey guys, hey! How about we settle this over a friendly game of
Fireball? Huh? I'll go unhook the smoke detectors!
Ross| How about we settle this right now! (He rips up the tickets.) There! Now,
no one's going to the game. Ha-ha-ha!
Chandler| I paid for those tickets!
Ross| No you didn't. You said you would, but you never did!
Chandler| Oh yeah! (Makes an unintelligible taunting sound.)
[Scene| Central Perk, Monica, Rachel, Joey, and Chandler are listening to a story being
told by Danny and his sister.]
Danny| so we finally get to the top of the mountain and airhead here (His
sister) forgets the camera!
Joey| Oh, y'know the same thing happened to me one time.
Chandler| When did that happen to you?!
Joey| Don't you remember when we were jogging in the park and we saw that really
pretty bird and wanted to take a pictureI didn't have my camera!
Chandler| Oh yeah. First off all, chasing the Churo guy isn't jogging.
Krista| Oh, this is so good (A piece of cake.) you have got to try it. (She
takes some on her finger and feeds it to Danny. Then takes a little more and does it
again. Meanwhile, the rest of the gang stares on in shock. Then they pick up a part of it
and some filling falls into his lap.)
Danny| Oh, damn! I got it on my pants.
Krista| Here, I'll get it. (She grabs a napkin and tries to wipe it up. The
thing that gets the rest of the gang going is that she's whipping awfully close to his
crotch. In fact, she is whipping his crotch. Chandler's about to come out of his chair.)
Krista| We'd better take these pants off upstairs or that stain's gonna set.
Danny| Yep. (To Rachel) I'm gonna wear these on our date tonight.
Rachel| Oh, great!
Chandler| Okay, bye! (To the gang.) Oh my God!!
Monica| That was unbelievable!
Rachel| Okay, see? I told you!
Joey| Yeah, wow, sorry Rach.
Chandler| I don't believe they're brother and sister.
Joey| They're brother and sister!!!
[Scene| In front of Macys, Phoebe has adorned her bucket with numerous signs.
Like "We are not a urinal!" and "I have no Macys info."
And other stuff like that. She also has a scowl on her face as she is ringing her bell. A
little old lady walks up to make a donation but Phoebe stops her.]
Phoebe| Oh whoa-whoa-whoa! Wait a minute, open up your hand; let me take a look.
(The lady opens up her hand.) Quarter. Dime. Lint? Not interested in that. (She throws the
lint away.) What's this? A Canadian coin? Get outta here! (The lady walks away.)
Phoebe| Whoa-whoa-whoa! No drinks near the bucket! Set it down over there and
then you can make a contribution! (The guy starts to walk away with a hurt look on his
face.) And you can leave the hurt bunny look over there too! (Her boss and a co-worker
walk up.) Hi Bob! (The same old lady from before walks bye.) (To the old lady.) I thought
I told you to get outta here!
Bob| Uh, Phoebe we've been getting complaints and uh, we're gonna move you to a
less high-profile spot.
Phoebe| What?!
Bob| Umm, Ginger's gonna take over this corner.
Phoebe| That chick can't handle my corner.
Bob| Look, either you leave, or we remove you.
Phoebe| Fine. (She hands her bell to Ginger and starts to take down her signs.)
(The same old lady walks by again.) All right, I'll give you one pointer. Look out for
that bitch. (The old lady.)
[Scene| Danny's apartment, there's a knock on the door and he answers it.]
Danny| Oh, hey Rach! I thought we said seven?
Rachel| Yeah uh, y'know what uh, let's skip it.
Danny| What?! Why?!
Rachel| Umm, you-you and your sister seem to have umm, a very special bond,
and
Danny| Oh great! That special bond again! Why do women have such a
problem with the fact that I'm close with my sister?
Rachel| Well, okay, look. I don't know, listen, I don't know what's going on
here but let's
Danny| Do-do you, do you have brothers?
Rachel| No, I have two sisters. But one of them has a very masculine energy.
Danny| Are you close with them?
Rachel| No-no, they're not very nice people.
Danny| Okay, listen, I really like you. Okay? I think this can go somewhere. So
what if I'm close to my family, are you gonna let that stand in the way of us?
Rachel| Well, uh, I-I don't know. See when-when you put it that way y'know it
does sort of
Krista| (calling from the bathroom) Danny! Hurry up! The bath is getting cold!
Danny| (seeing Rachel's shocked look) What?
Rachel| Yeah, okay, I'll see you later. (Gets up and runs from the apartment.)
[Scene| Chandler, Joey, and Ross's, Ross is there as Chandler enters.]
Chandler| Oh hey! There's some kids playing in the street, you wanna go down
there and give them a project, ruin their day?
Ross| Hey, if they have a ball maybe you can stick razor blades in it and teach
them a new game, Gonna Need Stitches Ball.
Joey| (entering) Hey guys! I was at the library all morning and I already
finished my five pages for today!
Ross| Yay!
Chandler| Great! Now, we can go to the Ranger game! (Pause) Last night!
Joey| No dude, Ross tore up the tickets!
Ross| I guess when you don't have so many distractions, it's easier for you to
focus. Huh?
Chandler| Yeah or also when you don't have somebody breathing down your neck ALL
THE LIVE LONG DAY!!
Joey| Yeah, well, that's fine, but the important thing is that I finished it.
And uh, I think it's really good, but y'know it'd really help me is if I could hear it. So
would you guys read it for me?
Chandler| All right. (Takes a copy.)
Ross| All right. (Takes another copy.)
Joey| Okay. (Reading.) "It's a typical New York City apartment. Two guys
are hanging out." Ross (Points to him.)
Ross| Hey man.
Chandler| What is up?
Ross| About yesterday, I was really wrong. I am sorry.
Chandler| No, it was me. I'm sorry. I over reacted.
Ross| Maybe it was both of us, but we had our best friend's interest
(Pauses and looks at Joey.) But we had our best friend's interest at heart.
Chandler| Could I be more sorry. (Looks at Joey.)
Ross| I don't know, I'm one sorry polentologist. (Stops reading.) All right
Joey, we get it. (To Chandler) I'm sorry.
Chandler| (To Ross) I'm sorry too.
Joey| Oh no! No-no, keep reading! The good part's coming up. Keep going.
Ross| (reading from the script.) I am sorry, Chandler.
Chandler| I am sorry, Ross.
Joey| A handsome man enters. (Playing the part of the handsome man.) Hey! How's
it going guys? I don't know what you two were talking about, but I'd like to say thanks to
both of you. You, (Ross) you wouldn't let me give up on myself, and you (Chandler) well
you co-created Fireball. The end.
Chandler| This took you all day?!
Joey| No-no, this only took five minutes. I spent the rest of the day coming up
with new, Ultimate Fireball. (Takes out a bowling ball and a propane torch.) Ha-ha!
[Scene| Monica and Rachel's, Monica and Rachel are about to read another one of Joey's
efforts.]
Joey| (Reading the scene set up.) Okay, it's a typical New York City apartment.
Two girls are just hanging out.
Monica| Hi, how are you doing Kelly?
Rachel| I'm doing just fine! God, Tiffany, you smell so great!
Monica| It's my new perfume. Why don't you come closer where you can really
appreciate it?
Rachel| Oh, y'know Joey, you are sick!
Monica| This is disgusting!
Rachel| I'm not reading this!
Joey| What?! Wait-wait-wait! The handsome man was about to enter!!

[Scene| Monica and Rachel's, Monica and Rachel are hosting a New Year's party. So the
place is crowded and in a shameless promotion for NBC they're watching Jay Leno's coverage
of New Year's from Time Square.]
Jay Leno|
Joey| All right! Here we go! 1999! The year of Joey!
Chandler| (deadpan, standing next to Monica) We're very happy for you.
Joey| What's the matter?!
Chandler| We wanted to kiss at midnight, but nobody else is going to so
y'know
Joey| All right, I'll take care of it.
Monica| Oh no, wait! Joey!
Ross| (hopping) 73! 72! 71!
Joey| Ross! Ross! Ross, listen! Who are you kissing at midnight, huh? Rachel or
Phoebe?
Ross| What?
Joey| Well you gotta kiss someone, you can't kiss your sister.
Ross| Well, who's gonna kiss my sister.
Joey| Chandler.
Ross| Awww, man! Really?
Joey| Dude-dude, who would you rather have kiss your sister, me or Chandler?
Ross| That's a good point.
Joey| Yeah.
Ross| Oh well, since I have that whole history with Rachel, I guess Phoebe.
Joey| Okay, great!
Ross| All right.
Joey| Pheebs! Pheebs! Ross wants to kiss you at midnight!
Phoebe| It's so obvious, why doesn't he just ask?
Joey| Rach! Rach! Listen, I'm gonna kiss you at midnight.
Rachel| What?!
Ross| Well, everyone's gotta kiss someone. You can't kiss Ross you got the
history.
Rachel| So?
Joey| So? Who would you rather have kiss you, me or Chandler?
Rachel| Oh, good point.
Joey| Yeah!
All| (watching the ball drop) 3! 2! 1! HAPPY NEW YEAR!!
Chandler| (To Monica) Happy New Year!
Monica| Happy New Year.
Ross| (To Phoebe) Happy New Year, Pheebs!
Phoebe| You too!
Rachel| (To Joey) Happy New Year, Joey!
Joey| So did that do anything for ya?
[Scene| Monica and Rachel's, after the party. Everyone has left, except for the gang.]
Ross| Y'know what? I'm gonna go out on a limb and say no divorces in '99!
Rachel| But your divorce isn't even final yet.
Ross| Just the one divorce in '99! Y'know what, I am gonna be happy this year. I
am gonna make myself happy.
Chandler| Do you want us to leave the room, or?
Ross| Everyday I am gonna do one thing that I haven't done before. That
my friends is my New Year's resolution.
Phoebe| Ooh! That's a good one! Mine is to pilot a commercial jet.
Chandler| That's good one too, Pheebs. Now all you have to do is find a
planeload of people who's resolution is to plummet to their deaths.
Phoebe| Maybe your resolution is to not make fun of your friends, especially the
ones who may soon be flying you to Europe for free on their own plane.
Monica| She has a better chance of sprouting wings and flying up your nose than
you do of not making fun of us.
Ross| In fact, I'll bet you 50 bucks that you can't go the whole year without
making fun of us. Eh, y'know what, better yet? A week.
Chandler| I'll take that bet my friend. And you know what, paying me the 50
bucks could be the "new thing you do that day!" (Ross looks at him.) And it
starts right now!
Joey| All right, my New Year's resolution is to learn how to play the guitar.
Ross| Ohh.
Phoebe| Really?! How come?
Joey| Well, y'know those special skills I have listed on my resume? I would love
it would be great if one of those was true.
Phoebe| Do you want me to teach you? I'm a great teacher.
Joey| Really? Who-who have you taught?
Phoebe| Well, I taught me and I love me.
Joey| Yeah that'd be great! Thanks Pheebs!
Rachel| Op, look! Claire forgot her glasses! And she's gonna be really needing
these to keep an eye on that boyfriend, who, I hear, needs to keep his stapler in his desk
drawer, if you know what I'm talking about.
Monica| Hey Rach, maybe your resolution should be to umm, gossip less.
Rachel| I don't gossip!
Rachel| Well, maybe sometimes I find out things or I hear something and I pass
that information on y'know kinda like a public service, it doesn't mean I'm a gossip. I
mean, would you call Ted Kopel a gossip?
Monica| Well if Ted Kopel talked about his coworkers botched boob jobs, I would.
Rachel| What? They were like this!
[Scene| Central Perk, Ross is talking to a beautiful woman as Chandler and Joey enter.]
Woman|
Ross| Okay! (She leaves.) (To Chandler and Joey.) Hey!
Chandler and Joey|
Ross| I just asked that girl out.
Chandler| Nice!
Joey| Nice!! Yeah! Is that part of your resolution, your new thing for today?
Ross| Yes it is. See. (Shows them the piece of paper she gave him with her name
and phone number on it.)
Chandler| (reading it) Elizabeth Hornswoggle?
Ross| That's right, uh, Elizabeth Hornswoggle.
Chandler| Horn-swoggle.
Joey| You all right Chandler? Is there something funny about that name?
Chandler| No. No, I just think that maybe I-I'd heard it somewhere before. (Sits
down rubbing his temple.)
Joey| Oh really! Where? Somewhere funny I'd bet! (Chandler is straining to keep
quiet as Phoebe enters.)
Ross| Hi, Pheebs!
Phoebe| Hey!
Ross| Oh-oh, guess what? I-I have a date with Elizabeth (Talking into Chandler's
ear.) Hornswoggle.
Phoebe| Hornswoggle? (To Chandler) Ooh, this must be killing you.
Ross| All right, see you later.
Joey| See ya! All right Pheebs, I am ready for my first lesson.
Phoebe| Okay. (Joey tries to take the guitar.) Oh no-no-no, you don't touch the
guitar! First you learn here, (Points to her head.) then you learn here. (Points to the
guitar.)
Joey| Umm, okay.
Phoebe| Okay, lesson one chords. Now, I don't know the actual names of the
chords but umm, I-I-I made up names for the way my hand looks while I'm doing them. (She
starts to show Joey the chords. Transcribers Note
Chandler| What an interesting approach to guitar instruction. Y'know some might
find it amusing, I myself find it regular.
[Scene| Monica and Rachel's, Phoebe is entering with Rachel.]
Phoebe| Hey everybody, Rachel was so good today. She didn't gossip at all.
Rachel| I didnt! Even when I found outumm, all right, well let's
just say I found something out something about someone and let's just say she's gonna keep
it. (Goes into her room.)
Joey| Hey, Pheebs! Check-check this out. (Holds up his hand in one of Phoebe's
chords.)
Phoebe| Ooh, you nailed the Old Lady! (They both laugh at what she said.)
Joey| Yeah listen so, I thought I was getting better, so on my way home today I
stopped by this guitar store and
Phoebe| Did you, did you touch any of the guitars while you were there?
Did you?!
Joey| No.
Phoebe| Give me your hands. (He does and she smells his left hand.) Strings.
Gimme it! (He gives her his right hand and she smells it as well.) Pick. Do you want to
learn to play guitar?
Joey| Yes!
Phoebe| Then don't touch one!!
Ross| (entering, with Ben) Hi!
Ben| Hi!
Monica| Hi Ben!
Ben| Auntie Monica!! (He runs to hug her.)
Chandler| (notices something) Ross is wearing leather pants! Does nobody else
see that Ross is wearing leather pants? (Pause, no one speaks.) Someone comment on the
pants!
Rachel| I think they're very nice.
Monica| I like 'em.
Joey| Yeah! (Chandler bangs the table in frustration.)
Monica| I like them a lot.
Chandler| That's not what I had in mind! See, people like Ross don't generally
wear these types of pants. You see, they're very tight. (Motions to Ross's buttock.) Maybe
there's something in that area.
Ross| Oh see, I-I needed a new thing for today and there's this leather store
that always smells so good and I thought to myself, "Wow, (To Chandler) I never
really owned a good smelling pair of pants before."
Chandler| Oh come on!! (Storms out.)
Ross| (after he's left) Okay, seriously, what do you think?
Joey| You look like a freak.
Rachel| Awful, absolutely awful. (Plus other negative comments from Phoebe and
Monica.)
Ross| What are you, what are you doing?
Monica| It's my New Year's resolution!
Ross| What, to blind my child?
Monica| No! To take more pictures of all of us together. I mean I really think
it's the best resolution because everyone will enjoy the pictures.
Joey| Well, everyone will enjoy my music as well. (Does a chord and Monica
starts taking pictures of him and Phoebe. They both start to strike a pose with the
excessive amount of pictures that Monica takes.)
[Scene| Elizabeth Hornswoggle's apartment; Ross is there on his date with her. They are
sitting on the couch watching a movie. Ross is obviously hot.]
Ross| (talking to himself) My God! These pants are burning up! (He's still
wearing the leather pants.) (She snuggles closer.) Oh come on, she wants to snuggle now!
What is she trying to kill me? It's like a volcano in here! (Out loud.) Are you hot?
Elizabeth Hornswoggle| No.
Ross| Okay, it must just be me then.
Ross| That was just the pants on the couch. Umm, hey, do you, do you mind if I
use your bathroom?
Elizabeth| No, go ahead.
Ross| Thanks. (Gets up and as he does so, the sound returns. Without another
word he heads into her bathroom.)
Ross| (in ecstasy) Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhh.
Elizabeth| (yelling from outside) Hey, my favorite part is coming up!
Ross| 'Kay!
Ross| Oh my God!
[Scene| Monica and Rachel's, Phoebe is drilling Joey on the chords as Monica looks on.]
Phoebe| Tiger! (Joey moves his hand in an attempt to do the chord, in fact he
does it with each name.) Dragon! Iceberg!! (He fails.) Joseph, did you even study at all
last night?
Joey| Yes! Yes, I did.
Phoebe| Then do Iceberg!
Joey| (thinks) (quietly) G-sharp.
Phoebe| G-sharp? Have you been studying the real names of the chords?
(Joey doesn't answer.) Have you? (He looks away in shame.) Oh my God!
Joey| What?! I didn't touch a guitar!
Phoebe| No, but you're questioning my method!
Joey| No, I'm not questioning it, I'm saying it's stupid! (Notices Monica
standing between them and smiling.) What?! (The camera clicks, taking another picture.)
Monica| Thank you. (Leaves.)
Phoebe| Y'know none of my other student thought I was stupid.
Joey| Your other student, was you!
Phoebe| Yeah, well, y'know maybe you just need to try a little harder!
Joey| (looking in the Yellow Pages) Look, maybe I need to try a real teacher!
Right here! Here! Andy Cooper, he teaches guitar and look ooh, there's a nice picture of
him with a little kid and THE KID'S GOT A GUITAR!!!!!! (Storms out.)
Phoebe| Fine! You go learn from your qualified instructor! But don't come crying
to me when everyone's sick and tired of hearing you play Bad, Bad Leroy Brown!!
Rachel| (entering, singing) "Baddest man in the whole damn town."
Phoebe| Oh, fine! Take his side! (Storms out.)
Monica| (on phone) I can't wait to be with you! I'll sneak over as soon as Ross
picks up Ben. I'll just tell Rachel I'm gonna be doing laundry for a couple of hours.
Chandler| (on phone) Laundry. Huh. Is that my new nickname? (Rachel is
absolutely stunned, she opens her mouth in absolute amazement.)
Monica| (on phone) Awww, y'know what your nickname is, Mr. Big
Rachel| Arghh!! (She quickly hangs up the phone and starts to pace around
wondering what to do.)
[Scene| Chandler, Joey, and Ross's, The phone rings and Joey answers it.]
Joey| (answering phone) Hello?
Ross| (calling from Elizabeth's bathroom) Joey, it's Ross! I need some help!
Joey| Uhh, Chandler's not here.
Ross| Well, you can help me!
Joey| Okay.
Ross| Listen, I'm in Elizabeth's bathroom
Joey| Nice!
Ross| No, I-I got really hot in my leather pants so I took them off but they
must have shrunk from the-the sweat or-or-or my legs expanded from the heat. Look, I-I
can't put them back on. I can't!
Joey| Oh. That is quite a situation. Uh, do you see any like, powder?
Ross| Powder! Yeah! Yeah, I have powder! (Grabs some of her shelf.)
Joey| Good-good, okay, sprinkle some of that on your legs, it'll absorb some of
the moisture and then you can get your pants back up.
Ross| Yeah, okay, hold on! (He puts the phone down and proceeds to spread a
large amount of powder on his legs and makes another attempt at pulling up his pants. It
doesn't work, and without picking up the phone leans down to it.) (Almost in tears.)
They're not coming on man.
Joey| Umm, do you see anyoh, Vaseline?
Ross| Ohh, I-I see lotion, I have lotion! Will that work?
Joey| Yeah, sure, spread some of that on there.
Ross| Hold on.
Joey| Ross? You okay?
Ross| They're still, they're still not coming on man and the lotion and the
powder have made a paste!
Joey| Really?! Uhh, what color is it?
Ross| What difference does that make?!
Joey| Well, I'm justif the paste matches the pants, you can make yourself
a pair of paste pants and she won't know the difference!
Rachel| (entering) Joey, do you have a minute?
Ross| Dude, what am I gonna
Joey| (To Ross) Uh, Rachel's here, so good luck man, let me know how it works
out. (He hangs up the phone and strands Ross in the bathroom.)
Rachel| Oh, Joey, I have such a problem!
Joey| Oh well, you're timing couldn't be better. I am putting out fires all over
the place.
Rachel| Okay. Okay. Okay. Joey, I have got to tell you something!
Joey| What-what is it, what is it?
Rachel| Oh my God, it's so huge, but you just have to promise me that you cannot
tell anyone.
Joey| Oh no, no-no-no-no! I don't want to know!
Rachel| Yes! Yes! Yes, you do want to know! This is unbelievable!
Joey| I don't care, Rach! Look, I am tired of being the guy who knows all the
secrets but can't tell anyone!
Rachel| What? What secrets? You know secrets? What are they?
Joey| And you're not supposed to be gossiping!!
Rachel| I know, I know! I just can't keep this one in, so I pick up the
phone (Joey in a childish attempt to not hear what Rachel is about to say, puts his
fingers in his ears and starts to scream loudly. Rachel turns and walks out upon seeing
that Joey's not gonna listen, and as she exits Chandler walks in and sees Joey in his
current state.)
Joey| I'm not listening to you!
[Scene| Elizabeth's apartment; Elizabeth is inquiring as to the delay in Ross's exit
from her bathroom.]
Elizabeth| Ross, umm, you've been in there for a long time. I'm starting to get
kinda freaked out.
Ross| All right, I'm coming out. Hey, can you turn the lights off.
Elizabeth| No, let's just leave the lights on.
Elizabeth| Oh my God!
Ross| I had a problem.
[Scene| Central Perk, Joey is there to apologize to Phoebe.]
Joey| Hey, Pheebs?
Phoebe| No, I can't talk to you! I don't have a fancy ad in the Yellow Pages!
Joey| Look, Pheebs, I just, I wanna apologize for, for saying that your method
was stupid and-and maybe ask you to be my teacher again. And-and I promise, I won't touch
a guitar until you say I'm ready. (After a short pause she hands him her guitar.) You
really think I'm ready?
Phoebe| Uh-huh!
Joey| Wow! Cool! (He takes the guitar, stands up, and goes to play a note.
However, while strumming it, he knocks it out of his hands and it bounces off the table
and lands on the floor. Phoebe just stares at the guitar.)
Joey| (sitting back down) Was the chord at least right
Phoebe| No!
[Scene| Monica and Rachel's, Ross is returning from his horrible trek back home without
pants on. The whole gang is there.]
Chandler| Oh my God!
Monica| We heard about your pants, I'm so sorry.
Ross| This year was supposed to be great! But, it's only the second day and I'm
a loser with stupid leather pants that don't even fit!
All| No. No, you're not a loser.
Ross| Look at me! (Chandler squeaks in an attempt not to make fun of him.)
Monica| Hey, hey, look. Look Ross, Ben drew a picture of you! (Shows him Ben's
picture.) Huh? You're-you're a cowboy!
Ross| Oh, be-because of the leather pants.
Monica| See? Ben doesn't think you're a loser, he thinks you're a cowboy! Now
that's something.
Phoebe| Yeah!
Rachel| That really is something; that's really cool.
Joey| Howdy partner!
Ross| Maybe I should get another pair! Ooh, y'know, they-they had some with
fringe all down the sides. (Chandler starts rubbing his temple again.) I'm gonna go kiss
Ben goodnight. (He starts to head for Monica's bedroom.) I can't believe he thinks I'm a
cowboy. (Pause.) I would make a good cowboy. (He struts into Monica's room.)
Monica| Okay, now that everything's wrapped up here, I think I'm, I'm gonna go
do my laundry.
Chandler| Oh yeah, me too. Y'know if this shirt is dirty. (Smells it.) Yep.
Phoebe| Okay, I'm gonna go too. I'm gonna go to the airport. I figure if I hang
around there long enough, someone's bound to leave one of those planes unattended.
Rachel| Good luck, honey!
Phoebe| Bye! (She exits, leaving Rachel and Joey alone.)
Rachel| Hey, uh, Joey?
Joey| Umm?
Rachel| Remember that big thing I was gonna tell you about?
Joey| Oh, no! (Starts that screaming thing again. Rachel stops him by pulling
his fingers out of his ears.)
Rachel| I'm not gonna tell you, but if you found out on your own, that would be
okay and then we could talk about it. Right?
Joey| Well, then it wouldn't be a secret. So yeah, that would be okay. Yeah.
Yeah!
Rachel| (quietly) Yeah. Well. (Pause.) Hey uh Joe, would mind going over to
Chandler's bedroom and get that book back that he borrowed from me?
Joey| Now? You want me to go over there now?
Rachel| Yeah!
Joey| Do you know something?
Rachel| Do you know something?
Joey| I might know something.
Rachel| I might know something too.
Joey| What's the thing you know?
Rachel| Oh no, I can't tell you until you tell me what you know.
Joey| I can't tell you what I know.
Rachel| Well then I can't tell you what I know.
Joey| Okay, fine.
Joey| You don't know!
Joey| (gasps) YOU KNOW!!!!
Rachel| AND YOU KNOW!!!
Joey| Yeah, I know!!!!
Rachel| Chandler and Monica?!! Oh, this is unbelievable!! How long have you
known?
Joey| Too long! Oh my God, Rach, I've been dying to talk to someone about this
for so long! Listen, listen, we can't say anything about this to anybody, they're so weird
about that! Listen (Phoebe returns and interrupts them.)
Joey and Rachel|
Phoebe| Hey! It's raining. I don't want to fly in the rain. So
Joey| Oh, I am going to go for a walk in the rain.
Rachel| Ohhh, yeah, me too.
Phoebe| That's weird. (Pause.) I bet they're doing it.
[Scene| Central Perk, Phoebe, Ross, and Monica are there.]
Chandler| (entering) Oh good, okay, I can't take it anymore. I can't take it
anymore. So you win, okay? Here! (Hands him the 50 bucks he's about to owe him.) Pheebs?
Flying a jet? Better make it a spaceship so that you can get back to your home
planet! And Ross, phone call for you today, Tom Jones, he wants his pants back! And
Hornswoggle? What are you dating a character from Fraggile Rock?! (He sits down and
sighs in relief.)
[Scene| Monica and Rachel's, Rachel is trying to pry more information about Chandler
and Monica from Joey who's sitting on the couch and busy downing a pizza.]
Rachel| Come on Joey!!!
Joey| Rach, I told you everything I knew last night! Look, it's not that big of a deal,
so Monica and Chandler are doing it.
Rachel| I can't believe you would say that!
Joey| Sorry. Monica and Chandler are making love.
Rachel| No! I mean come on! This is a huge deal! (She sits next to him on the
couch.) Fine I wantI need more details, who-who initiated the first kiss?
Joey| (thinks) I don't know.
Rachel| Is he romantic with her?
Joey| I don't know.
Rachel| Are they in love?
Joey| (thinks) I don't know.
Rachel| You don't know anything.
Joey| Ohh, I know one thing!
Rachel| What?
Joey| They did it right there on the couch.
[Scene| Central Perk, everyone is there as Ross enters.]
Joey| Hey Ross!
Phoebe| Hey!
Ross| (disinterested) Hey-yeah. (He hurries up to the counter.) Hey Gunther, can I have
a scone please? (To the gang.) Wanna hear some good news? Someone I know is getting
married! Yeah! And weddings are happy occasions! Oh, by-the-by it's my ex-wife Emily!
All|  What? Oh!
Chandler| Sorry man.
Gunther| Here's your scone.
Ross| Oh, thanks Gunther. (He takes it, hands the plate it's on to Rachel, sets it down
on the table, and proceeds to pound it into oblivion while saying.) STUPID BRITISH SNACK
FOOD!!!!!!!
Chandler| Did they teach you that in your anger management class?
Phoebe| Hey, you know what might help you deal with it? Think of it this way, you and
Emily are in the past and you can't be mad about the past. So are you still mad about the
Louisiana Purchase?
Rachel| Pheebs, I dont think anyone's mad about that.
Phoebe| Exactly! Because it's in the past!
Joey| (eyeing the flattened scone) Anybody gonna eat that?
[Scene| Chandler's office, Monica and him are at a party his office is throwing.]
Monica| Look at us all dressed up for the big office party! By the way, what are we
celebrating?
Chandler| Oh, we had a lot of liquor left over from the Christmas party.
Monica| I think this is so cool because none of our friends are here and we can be a
real couple. We don't have to hide.
Chandler| I know, I can do this. (He takes her hand.)
Monica| Ooh, and I can do this. (She kisses him on the cheek.)
Both|
Doug| Hey Bing! (Slaps him on his ass.) (Sees Monica) Wo-ho-ho, who's the pretty lady
and what the hell is she doing with you?
Chandler| I asked myself that very question, sir. Uh, (Points to Monica) this is
Monica. (Points to his boss.) This is my boss, Doug. Doug this is Monica.
Monica| Hi, nice to meet you!
Doug| Hi! And this is my wife Kara.
Kara| Nice to meet you Monica. Bing! (Slaps Chandler on his butt.)
Doug| Say uh, Bing, did you hear about the new law firm we got working for us?
Chandler| No, sir.
Doug| Yeah, Dewey, Cheatum, and Howe.
Doug| Come on honey, let's go drink our body weight. (They walk off leaving Chandler
and Monica alone.)
Monica| What was that?
Chandler| What?
Monica| That noise you just made?
Chandler| Oh, that was my work laugh.
Monica| Really? Your work laugh?
Chandler| Oh, believe me, to survive this party, you're gonna have to come up with one
too.
Monica| All right, check me out.
Chandler| Okay.
Doug| says $30 Father; same as in town.
[Scene| Central Perk, Monica is buying a muffin as Chandler runs in.]
Chandler| Hey! Everybody at work loved you last night!
Monica| Really?
Chandler| And! They like me more just because I was with ya! I think you
repaired a lot of the damage from when they met Joey. And Doug wants us to play tennis
with them. He's never even talked to me outside of work. Except for that time when
we bumped into each other at that strip club. (She glares at him.) Strip church. Anyway,
I'm gonna go try and find a racquet.
Monica| Hey, I thought you already had one.
Chandler| Oh I used too, but then Joey thought it would be fun to go to Central Park
and hit rocks atbigger rocks. (He starts to leave and stops an entering Rachel.) Hey
Rach, do you have a tennis racquet?
Rachel| Oh umm, y'know I lent it to Joey and I never actually got it back.
Chandler| Okay, good luck with that. (Exits.)
Rachel| (To Monica) Hey!
Monica| Hi!
Rachel| What's up?!
Monica| What are you doing here? I thought you had to do inventory all day.
Rachel| Well yeah, I do, but I decided to take a long lunch and spend some time with my
friend Monica. Y'know I-I feel that we don't talk anymore. How are you? What is new with
you?
Monica| Uhh, not much. Uh, work's good.
Rachel| Oh y'know what, we dont have to talk about work. We can talk about
anything!
Monica| Okay. Umm
Rachel| Hey! Y'know what? Let's talk about relationships!
Monica| Okay, what's going on with you?
Rachel| Nothing! You go!
Monica| Well, I-Ithere was this guy at the bank that I thought was cute umm, but
I don't anymore.
Rachel| Wow that's uh, juicy. Umm, (checks watch) y'know what though Mon, I actually do
have a lot of work to do so if-ifare you sure there's just not anything else?
Monica| Yes, I'm sure! Rachel is there something that you want to talk me about?
Rachel| No! (Gets up to leave.) (Under her breath.) If there was I wouldn't tell you.
[Scene| Chandler, Joey, and Ross's, Phoebe is settling a dispute between the chick and
the duck.]
Phoebe| Okay, then what happened?
Phoebe| (gasps) Ohh. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. (The chick clucks.) You'll get your turn!
Ross| (entering from the bathroom) Hey Pheebs, what's going on?
Phoebe| Nothing! (Picks up and sets the chick down on the floor.) (To the chick.) This
is not over!
Ross| No! No! No!
Phoebe| What?!
Ross| I was up all night writing this really nasty letter to Emily! It was perfect and
now it's all covered in-in (The duck quacks.) Actually, thanks!
Joey| (entering from his room) All right! Everybody ready to go to the movies?
Ross| Uh actually, I think I'm gonna skip it.
Joey| Really?
Ross| Yeah, I'm gonna stay and read my book. I just wanna be alone right now.
Joey| Oh. Are you sure you don't want to come? Tom Hanks, Meg Ryan, they get mail and
stuff.
Ross| That's okay, Joe.
Joey| All right, let's go Pheebs.
Ross| (licks the envelope and encounters a foreign substance on the glue.) Oh God!
[Scene| A tennis court somewhere in the city of New York, it's the doubles match-up of
a century Chandler and Monica versus Doug and Kara.]
Doug| Bing!
Kara| Oww!!
Monica| Game!
Doug| Well, I gotta tell ya Bing; that partner of yours is a real tiger. (To his wife.)
Are you all right sweethart?
Kara| (out of breath and mouths) I'm not all right.
Doug| We're, we're just gonna get a little sip of water.
Monica| Am I on fire today or what?! Those birds are browned, basted, and ready to be
carved!
Chandler| Okay, easy Martina. I think we should let them win the next game.
Monica| I'm sorry, I don't understand what you just said.
Chandler| Let them win one.
Monica| Are you crazy?! We own those two! I mean look at 'um, he can't breath and she's
popping pills.
Chandler| You're not even giving them a chance!
Monica| They have racquets don't they?!
Doug| Uh Bing, I think we're gonna make this the last game.
Chandler| Oh yes, sir! Put me out of my misery. Are you sure you never played pro?
(Does his work laugh.) (To Monica) Please let them win!
Monica| I'll take it down to 95% but that's the best I can do.
Chandler| Oopsey, missed it!
Monica| I got it! (She hits a forehand smash that bounces right in between Doug and
Kara and scores a point.)
Doug| Nice shot.
Monica| I got it!!
Chandler| Long! (Gives Monica the Work Laugh.)
[Scene| Monica and Rachel's, Monica and Chandler are returning from the game.]
Monica| I can't believe you let them win!
Chandler| Yeah, at least you hid your feelings well about it. (Removes a smashed
racquet from his bag.)
Monica| I was frustrated.
Chandler| It was my racquet.
Monica| I was frustrated with you!
Chandler| If we hadn't lost the game they never would've invented us to dinner tomorrow
night.
Monica| Y'know what really bothers me? Isit's how-how different you act around
them! I mean y'know the throwing the tennis games, the fake laugh, the "I'll see you
around, Bing!" "Not if I see you first, Doug!" (Mocks the fake laugh.) I
gotta tell you, I don't like Work Chandler. Okay? The guy's a suck-up.
Chandler| Okay y'know what, because you said that, I'm not putting out tonight.
[Scene| Chandler, Joey, and Ross's, the next morning the girls are there with Joey.]
Monica| I'm telling you, something's wrong! My brother does not stay out all night.
Joey| Maybe we should check the trash chute.
Rachel| Ross couldn't fit down the trash chute.
Joey| That's right, he almost could. Which is exactly how I got stuck there.
Phoebe| Hey!
Rachel| There he is!
Monica| Oh my God! (She goes to hug him, stops short, and hits him on the shoulder.)
Where the hell have you been?!!
Ross| Just, y'know out.
Rachel| Ohh, out, oh God, I don't know why we didn't think to check there!
Phoebe| What were you doing?
Ross| I uh, went to a bar. And then I just uh, just walked around for a while.
Rachel| You walked around all night in the city by yourself?
Joey| (snaps his fingers) He hooked up! He hooked up with someone.
Ross| Look, I don't have to answer your questions! Okay? I'm a big boy, I can do
whatever I want!
Joey| He hooked up!! Tell us about her!
[Suddenly the door opens and Ross's mystery girl enters. I'll give you a hint to who it
is| OH.MY.GAWD!! Uh-huh, it's Janice.]
Janice| (entering) Ross you left you scarf in(sees everyone.) Hey you guys. (Does
the laugh.)
[Scene| Chandler, Joey, and Ross's, continued from earlier.]
Janice| Uh-oh-okay. Uh-oh-okay. I know what you all are thinking. But Chandler is in Yemen!
I'm a young woman! I have needs! I can't wait forever!
Rachel| Yeah! No that's what I was thinking.
Janice| So I'm asking you please, take a moment before you judge me.
Phoebe| Oh, nobody's judging you. (They all turn and look at Ross.)
Janice| Oh! Okay! (To Ross) You, Mister Right Place at the Right Time, call me! (Does
her famous, or is that infamous, laugh and exits.)
Ross| Okay, look, I-I know what you guys are going to say
Phoebe| You two will have very hairy children.
Ross| Okay, I didn't know you would say that.
Rachel| Ross! Janice?!
Joey| All right, hold on! Hold on. Hold on. This is Ross, okay? He's our friend. He
obviously went crazy. He obviously lost his mind.
Ross| Look, I didn't lose my mind! Okay, Janice and I have a lot in common!
We've-we've both been divorced. We-we both have kids.
Phoebe| So are you actually gonna see her again?
Joey| Phoebe! Don't put ideas in his head!
Ross| I am gonna see her again.
Joey| Damnit Phoebe!!
[Scene| Monica and Rachel's, Monica is going through her purse as Rachel rushes in.]
Rachel| (entering) Okay, I have to tell you something that I have never admitted during
our entire friendship! But, when we were in high school I made out with James Farrell even
when I knew that you liked him! Wow, that feels so good to get off my chest! Okay, you go!
Monica| My turn? What-what are you talking about?
Rachel| Ugh, Monica, I know about you and Chandler.
Monica| What?!
Rachel| I overheard you guys on the phone the other day, and you said, "I'll just
tell Rachel that I'm doing laundry for a couple of hours." And he said,
"Laundry? Is that my new nickname?" And you said, "No! You know what
your nickname is, Mr. Big."
Monica| Well. Sounds like you're writing yourself a little play there Rach. Wow! Let me
know how that one turns out.
Rachel| Well, I wouldn't know because I got so freaked out that I hung up the phone.
Monica| Well, if you had kept listening, you-you would have heard me call him Mr.
Big(Thinks)ot.
Rachel| What?!
Monica| Mr. Bigot. He tells the most racist jokes.
Rachel| All right. So you're telling me that there is nothing going on between you and
Chandler.
Monica| Me and Chandler?! (Does her fake laugh.)
[Scene| Chandler, Joey, and Ross's, Phoebe and Joey are there.]
Joey| All right, put your 20 bucks down. First one to find the tasty treat wins. Okay?
Phoebe| Uh-hmm.
Joey| All right. Let's get the contestants out of their isolation booths. (He removes
the waste bucket that's over the duck and the laundry basket that's over the chicken.) And
they're off! (He puts his foot in front of the chick, stopping it from moving.)
Phoebe| Get your foot off my contestant! Judge!
Joey| Judge rules, no violation.
Phoebe| Ohhh.
Ross| (entering) Hey guys!
Phoebe| Hey!
Joey| Yeah!
Ross| Y'know what? It sounds so weird to say this but, I just had a great day with
Janice!
Joey| What?!
Phoebe| Are you serious?!
Ross| Yeah! I opened up to her about all the terrible stuff that's been happening to
me. I mean I talked for hours. (Joey has lost interest and is watching the race again.) It
is amazing to have someone give you such-such focused attention.
Phoebe| You don't need Janice for that, you've got us. We
Joey| And the duck gets the Nutter-Butter!
Phoebe| (turning from Ross.) No!! Hey-hey that's not a Nutter-Butter, that's just an
old Wonton!
Joey| Judge rules, Nutter-Butter.
Phoebe| Ohh, tough call.
Joey| Yeah.
[Scene| Doug's house, Chandler, Monica, and them are just finishing dinner.]
Doug| But seriously, I believe that we should all support President Clinton. And her
husband Bill. (Chandler does the laugh.)
Kara| So how do you kids like your coffee?
Monica| Oh, none for me. Thanks.
Chandler| Just a little bit of sugar.
Doug| Well, maybe I'll bring it out and have Monica stick her finger in it. That oughta
sweeten it up, huh? (Once again, with the laugh.)
Monica| (To Chandler) How does that laugh not give you a headache?
Chandler| Oh, you get used to it.
Monica| Y'know, I-I-I don't think that I can. So if you don't mind, maybe this will be
it for me on the work things.
Chandler| So I laugh at my boss's jokes, what's the big deal?
Monica| I'd rather hang out with a sniveling work weasel guy when I can be hanging out
with my boyfriend who I actually respect.
Chandler| Oh. (Does a double take when he realizes what she just said.)
Doug| (entering) Uh, I gotta apologize for Kara's coffee. Y'know, I feel sorry for it
if it ever got in a fight, it's not strong enough to defend itself. (Chandler does not
laugh.) Did you hear what I said Bing?
Chandler| What?
Doug| The joke Bing. What's the matter with you?
Chandler| Well, I-I just didn't think it was funny sir.
Doug| Excuse me?
Chandler| Well, I just
Monica| (interrupting) Honey, I just don't think that you understood the joke.
Chandler| Really?
Monica| Yeah! I mean it was really funny, I-I just don't think you got it. You see
Kara's coffee is-is-is weak tasting, okay? But-but what Doug was-was imply that it was
weak physically. You get it now honey?
Chandler| I think I do! (They all laugh.) Thank you, Monica.
Monica| I thought you could use the help.
Chandler| Coffee in a fight! (Does the laugh again.)
[Scene| Monica and Rachel's, Rachel is going through the mail as Joey enters.]
Joey| (entering) Hey Rach! Hey, you mind if I read my comic books in here?
Rachel| Sure! Why?
Joey| Oh well, Chandler and Monica are over there and it's kinda hard to concentrate.
Rachel| What?! She just called and said that she was gonna be working late! She keeps
lying to me! That's it! Y'know what? I'm just gonna go over there and confront them right
now!
Chandler| (from his bedroom) All right, so you're telling me that I have to tell racist
jokes now?!
Monica| Sorry! I'm justI'm not very good at this! I'm a terrible liar and I hate
having to lie to Rachel!
Chandler| But we're not ready to tell yet!
Monica| I know! It's just thatever since high school Rachel was the one person I
told everything too. Y'know? I miss that so much now. She's my best friend.
Monica| (entering) Joey?! Oh my God, Rachel!
Rachel| Hey! Hi!
Monica| Wh-wh-what are you doing here? (She tries to pull her shirt down to cover the
fact that she's wearing men's boxers.]
Rachel| Well, I was actuallyI-I came over here to-to borrow this lamp. To umm,
look at my books, y'know, see them a little better.
Monica| Okay great!
Rachel| Yeah!
Monica| Great! Umm, well what-what I was doing in Chandler's room is that umm, I was
cleaning it! In fact, he pays me to clean it!
Rachel| Oh! What a great way to earn some extra pocket money.
Monica| Y'know when I said to you earlier that I was at work umm, I'm at my new work.
Rachel| That's good enough. Right? (Pause.) Okay, well umm, I'm gonna go look at my
books!
Monica| Okay.
Rachel| Okay.
Monica| I'll get back to my new job.
Rachel| 'Kay. (Pause.) Congratulations on your new job. (She goes and hugs Monica and
is almost in tears.)
Chandler| Man, she is really gullible.
[Scene| Central Perk, Ross and Janice are sitting on the couch.]
Gunther| Here you go. (Serves them both some coffee.)
Ross| Thanks!
Janice| Actually, I should get going.
Ross| Are you sure? Because I can stay out as late as you want. I told you how I'm on
sabbatical from work, right?
Janice| Yes! Yes! You did!
Ross| Oh
Janice| What is wrong now?!
Ross| This isn't what I ordered! Man! Can anything go right in my life?! First my
marriage falls apart and then
Janice| I know! I know! And then you lose your apartment! And then you lose your job!
And then your ex-wife gets married so fast! And now the coffeeahh!! Ross, we need to
talk.
Ross| Okay. Sometimes I feel
Janice| No-no-no, no. I'm going to talk. I believe that the sun has set on our
day in the sun.
Ross| Huh?
Janice| (starting to cry) You're a very sweet person Ross, umm, unfortunately I don't
think I can take another second of you whining!!
Ross| Let-let me make sure I'm hearing this right, you're ending this with me because I'm
too whiney? (Janice makes an agreeing sound.) So you're saying, I've become so whiney that
I annoy you, Janice.
Janice| Well yeah!!
Ross| OHMYGOD!!
Janice| Are you gonna be okay?
Ross| I am now.
Janice| Okay.
Joey| Umm, hi.
Janice| Oh hi! Well, I guess that's two out of three, Joey. (Laughs and exits.)
[Scene| Chandler, Joey, and Ross's, Chandler is reading a magazine as Ross hands him a
beer.]
Ross| Dude, we got to talk.
Chandler| Okay.
Ross| I just wanted to tell you something before you heard it from someone else and I
hope this isn't too weird, but uh, I had uh, a thing with Janice. (He laughs, his real
laugh this time.) What you're-you're not mad?
Chandler| Why would I be mad?
Ross| Well, because y'know there are certain rules about this kind of stuff. You don't
uh, you don't fool around with your uh, friend's ex-girlfriends or possible girlfriends or
girls they're related to.
Chandler| (realizes what Ross just said and the implications to him) I am mad! But you
know what I'm gonna do? I'm gonna forgive you! Because that's what friends do! They
forgive their friends when they do everything you just said, all on the list there. Well,
but I want you to remember that I forgave you.
Ross| Okay.
Chandler| I also want you to remember that I let you live here rent free!
Ross| All right.
Chandler| And, I want you to remember that I gave you twenty (counts his money) seven
dollars. No strings attached. Now, if you can't remember that, I think we should write it
downlet's write it down!

[Scene| Chandler's bedroom, he is giving Monica a massage.]
Monica| I can't believe we've never done this before! It's sooo good! So
good for Monica!
Chandler| Oh! Look at that, time's up! My turn!
Monica| That was a half an hour?
Chandler| It's your timer.
Monica| Y'know, I don't like to brag about it, but I give the best
massages!
Chandler| All right, then massage me up right nice!
Chandler| Ah! Ahh!! Ahh!!
Monica| It's so good, isn't it?
Chandler| It's so good I don't know what I've done to deserve it!
Monica| Say good-bye to sore muscles!
Chandler| Good-bye muscles!!
[Scene| Central Perk, Chandler and Joey are sitting on the couch.]
Chandler| I'm telling you, she gives the worst massages ever!! Okay, it was like
she was torturing me for information. And I wanted to give it up I justI didn't know
what it was!
Joey| Chandler, if it really hurts that bad you should just tell her.
Chandler| Look, for the first time in my life I'm in a real relationship. Okay,
I'm not gonna screw that up by y'know, telling the truth.
Ross| (walking up with Rachel and carrying coffee) Hey.
Joey| Whoa, dude, look out! You almost crushed my hat! (He picks a hat up from
the floor. It's one of those magician stovepipe hats.)
Ross| Sorry.
Chandler| (examining the hat) And the bunny got away. (Turns and starts looking
for the bunny as Joey puts the hat on.)
Ross| (glaring at Joey) This would be the place where you explain the hat.
Joey| Oh! Yeah, look there's this play all right? And I'm up for the part of
this real cool like suave international guy. A real clothes horse. So I figure that
everyone at the audition is gonna be wearing this kinda y'know, ultra-hip, high fashion
stuff.
Chandler| And you're gonna make them all disappear.
Joey| Yeah, like you could find something as sophisticated as this.
Chandler| Done.
Rachel| Joey, if you wanna look good, why don't you just come down to the store?
I'll help you out.
Joey| Great! Thanks, Rach!
Rachel| Sure! (Pause) God, please take those off!
Joey| All right.
Ross| Hey Pheebs, how's it going?
Chandler| Hey.
Phoebe| Hey! Umm, well, only okay because I just got back from, from the
hospital.
Rachel| What?
Ross| Is everything okay?
Joey| Are you all right?
Phoebe| Oh yeah, no-no-no. I'm fine. I'm okay, but umm, my Grandma sorta died.
Joey| Pheebs! Sorry!
Phoebe| It's okay, I mean she had a really incredible life. And it's not like
I'm never gonna see her again, y'know she's gonna visit.
Rachel| Well maybe, maybe she's with us right now?
Phoebe| Yeah, her first day on a new spiritual plane and she's gonna come to the
coffeehouse!
Monica| (entering, in a hurry) Guys! Guys! I just saw two people having sex in a
car right outside.
Ross| Uhh, Pheebs' Grandmother just died.
Monica| Ohh my God, I'm so sorry.
Phoebe| It's okay. Actually y'know what, it's kinda cool. 'Cause it's like
y'know, one life ends and another begins.
Monica| (to the guys) Not the way they're doing it. What, what happened? How did
she die?
Phoebe| Well umm, okay we were in the market and she bent down to get some
yogurt and she just never came back up again.
Joey| Pheebs, I'm so sorry.
Phoebe| It was really sweet. The last thing she said to me was; "Okay dear,
you go get the eggs and I'm gonna get the yogurt and we'll meet at the checkout
counter." And y'know what? We will meet at the checkout counter.
[Scene| Bloomingdale's, Rachel is fixing Joey up with some new clothes.]
Rachel| Okay now Joey, y'know that since you're returning all of this stuff
right after the audition you're gonna have to wear underwear?
Joey| All right, then you'd better show me some of that too then.
Rachel| Okay, it's missing something. Ooh, I know! Umm, okay. (Goes and grabs a
bag, that looks like a purse, and shows it to Joey.)
Joey| Really? A purse?
Rachel| It's not a purse! It's a shoulder bag.
Joey| It looks like a women's purse.
Rachel| No Joey, look. Trust me, all the men are wearing them in the spring
catalog. Look. (Shows him.) See look, men, carrying the bag.
Joey| See look, women, carrying the bag. (He puts it on his shoulder and
looks at himself in the mirror and likes what he sees.) But it is odd how a women's purse
looks good on me, a man.
Rachel| Exactly! Unisex!
Joey| Maybe you need sex. I had sex a couple days ago.
Rachel| No! No Joey! U-N-I-sex.
Joey| Well, I ain't gonna say no to that.
[Scene| Ursula's apartment, Phoebe is about to break the bad news to her sister. She
knocks on the door.]
Ursula| Who is it?
Phoebe| It's Phoebe.
Ursula| Oh great! (Opens the door.) (Disappointed) Oh, you. Umm, what's up?
Phoebe| Umm, well I sorta have some bad news, can I come in?
Ursula| Umm, yeahno thanks.
Phoebe| Umm, well, umm Grandma died.
Ursula| Wow! Didn't she die like five years ago?
Phoebe| No, she just died today! Okay, umm, we're having a memorial service
tomorrow.
Ursula| Okay, I know that I went to that all ready.
Phoebe| No you didn't!
Ursula| Well, then who's been dead for five years?
Phoebe| Well, lots of people! Look, are you coming to memorial service or not?
Ursula| Umm, no. See I already thought she was dead so I kinda made my peace with it.
Plus, I'm going to a concert tomorrow. So I'd invite you, but umm, I only have two
tickets left.
Phoebe| Fine. Okay, enjoy your concert. (Starts to leave.)
Ursula| Thanks! Enjoy your funeral.
[Scene| Central Perk, Ross and Chandler are on the couch as Joey enters with his new
bag.]
Joey| Hey!
Chandler| Hey!
Chandler| Wow! You look just like your son Mrs. Tribbiani!
Joey| What? Are you referring to my man's bag? At first, I thought it just
looked good, but it's practical too. Check it out! It's got compartments for all your
stuff! Your wallet! Your keys! Your address book!
Ross| Your make-up!
Rachel| (entering) Joey, what are you doing with the bag? You're audition is not
until tomorrow.
Joey| Yeah, but sandwich time is right now. (Removes a sandwich and starts
eating.)
Rachel| Joey, y'know you get any mustard on that bag, you can't return it.
Joey| Why would I return it? I love this bag!
Rachel| All right, then you owe me $350.
Joey| Fine! Do you take Vasa or Mustercard? (He's holding the fake credit cards
that come with the bag.)
Rachel| (glaring at him) Joey
Joey| All right relax, look I'll pay you with the money from the acting job I am
definitely gonna get thanks to you.
Ross| What's the part, Anti-man?
Rachel| Hey, don't listen to them. I think it's sexy.
Joey| U-N-I-sexy? (Smiles provocatively.)
[Scene| Phoebe's Grandmother's memorial, Phoebe is at the door welcoming people.]
Phoebe| Well hello, Mrs. Penella! Thank you so much for coming! Well, okay look,
here's your umm, 3-D glasses and Reverend Pong will tell you when to put them on.
Rachel| Hi sweetie!
Ross| Hey, how are you holding up?
Joey| Hey Pheebs, I'm so sorry.
Phoebe| (notices his bag.) Hey, y'know what? My Grandma had the exact same bag!
Joey| Here, I brought you some flowers. (He pulls them out of the bag.)
Phoebe| Thanks!
Chandler| Pulling flowers out it makes the bag look a lot more masculine.
Man|
Phoebe| Yeah, welcome.
Man|
Phoebe| Umm here's your 3-D glasses.
Man|
Phoebe| So how did you know Francis?
Man|
Phoebe| Really?! What's your name?
Man|
Frank Sr.| (Seeing the look on her face) Y'know what? Strike that. My name uh,
actually is-is Joe. Uh, Joe umm, Hill.
Phoebe| You're Frank Buffay?
Frank Sr.| Shh! (Whispers) No! Joe Hill!
Phoebe| You just said
Frank Sr.| Y'know what, I gotta go. And thank you so much for coming.
(Hands back his glasses and hurries out.)
Phoebe| But
Phoebe| Oh my God!
Monica| What?! What honey?
Ross| What happened?
Phoebe| That was my dad!
Chandler| Oh my God!
Joey| (approaches, wearing his glasses) Hey you guys, check it out. Check it
out. (Moves his hand towards and away from his face.) It's like it's coming right at me.
(Chandler helps out a little bit by pushing on Joey's arm, which causes his hand to slap
him in his face.)
[Scene| The Funeral Home, continued from earlier. Phoebe is returning after looking for
her father.]
Monica| Oh, did you catch him?!
Phoebe| Uh-huh.
Ross| Wh-what did he say?!
Phoebe| He said, "Nice to meet you Glenda." (They stare at her,
dumbfounded) Well, obviously I couldn't give him my real name?
Rachel| Why?! Why not?!
Phoebe| Come on, you saw the way he ran out of here! What do you think? He's
gonna stick around and talk to the daughter he abandoned!
Joey| What did you say to him?
Phoebe| Well, I said, I told him y'know, that I was the executor person of
Francis' will and that I needed to talk to him so I'm gonna meet him at the coffee house
later.
The Pastor|
Phoebe| All right, well, I just can't think about that right now. I just wanna
say good-bye to my Grandma.
Rachel| Okay.
Monica| All right, let's go say good-bye.
[Scene| Monica and Rachel's, after the funeral, everyone is there.]
Joey| (entering, with bag) Hey! I'm off to my audition. How do I look?
Rachel| Ahhh, I think you look great! That bag is gonna get you that
part.
Chandler| And a date with a man!
Joey| Y'know what? Make fun all you want. This is a great bag! Okay? And
it's as handy as it is becoming. Now, just because you don't understand something, doesn't
make it wrong. All right? So from now on you guys are gonna have to get used to the fact
that Joey, (pats the bag) comes with a bag! (Exits.)
Phoebe| All right, I'd better go too. I have to go talk to my dad.
Rachel| Ooh, Pheebs, what are you gonna say? Are you gonna tell him who you are?
Phoebe| Umm, no, not at first 'cause I-I don't want to freak him out
Ross| Well, but aren't you pissed at him?! I mean this guy abandoned you!
I gotta tell you if this were me, this guy would be in some serious physical danger!
(Getting worked up) I mean I-I-I'd walk in there and I'd be like, "Yo, dad! You and
me outside right now!" (Calming down.) I kinda scared myself.
Monica| Well, at least you scared someone.
Phoebe| Y'know it's funny, you'd think I'd be angry. I mean, you'd think
I'd wanna rip his tiny little head off. Fortunately, I'm past it.
Monica| Phoebe, you do seem a little tense. Here, let me help you.
Phoebe| All right.
Phoebe| Oh! Get off!! Ow!! Oh, stop it!! Why?! Why are you doing that to me?!
Monica| What are you talking about?
Phoebe| As a masseuse and a human, I'm begging you, never do that to anyone!
Monica| (indignant) I give good massages! (Ross laughs.) I used to give them to
Rachel all the time before she got allergic! And-and-and Chandler loves them! Watch! (She
starts giving Chandler a massage.)
Phoebe| (seeing the look on Chandler's face) He-he does not like it! He hates
it! He's in pain!
Monica| No he's not!
Chandler| (wincing) Yes, he is!
Monica| What?!
Chandler| I'm sorry but, ow-owww-owww!
Monica| You've been lying to me? I can't believe you'd do that.
Ross| Well, maybe he just didn't want to hurt your feelings.
Monica| But the minute we start to lie to each other (Pauses after she
realizes what she's saying.) And by 'we' I mean society.
[Scene| Joey's audition, he is with bag.]
The Casting Director| Any time you're ready, Joey.
Joey| (reading from the script) Well, you must be new here. Why don't we get a
table and I'll buy you a drink.
The Casting Director| (stopping him) I'm sorry. Could you, could you try it
without the purse?
Joey| Yeah, sure. (He takes it off and starts reading.) Well, you must be new
here. Maybe we shouldI'm sorry, can I ask you something? (He stops and asks a
question.)
The Casting Director| Sure. What?
Joey| Well, first it's not a purse.
The Casting Director| Okay, anytime.
Joey| I mean if-if you're thinking it's a woman's bag, it's not. It's a man's
bag!
The Casting Director| Okayyyy! Anddd, go!
Joey| All right look, let me show you the catalog! (Does so.) See? Huh? It's the
latest thing! Everyone's got one! Men! Women! Children! Everyone's carrying them!
The Casting Director| Umm, do you sell these bags?
Joey| Noooo. No-no-no, these babies sell themselves.
The Casting Director| Okay! Thank you! That was great!
Joey| Yeah but I didnt read anything.
The Casting Director| I think we've seen enough!
Joey| Okay! All right, I'll see ya. (As he's walking off stage.) (Patting the
bag.) We got it! We got it!
[Scene| Monica and Rachel's, Chandler is poking his head in.]
Chandler| Hey, is Rachel here?
Monica| No.
Chandler| (coming all the way in) Listen, I just wanted to apologize about this
afternoon and the whole massage thing. Y'know? I-I really like 'em.
Monica| Oh, please, stop! Look, we're supposed to be honest with each other. I-I
just wish you could tell mejust say, "I don't like your massages."
Chandler| (falling into that trap) I don't like your massages.
Monica| (starting to cry) See? It's no big deal.
Chandler| Okay, but now see you're crying!
Monica| I'm not crying about that! I'm crying about something that happened at
work.
Chandler| What?
Monica| (bursting into tears) My boyfriend said he didn't like my massages.
Chandler| It's okay, you don't have to be the best at everything.
Monica| Oh my God! You don't know me at all!
Chandler| Okay, you give the worst massages in the world.
Monica| I'm crying here!!
Chandler| Okay, hear me out. Okay? You give the best bad massages. If
anybody was looking for the best bad massage and they were thinking to themselves,
"Who's the best of that?" They'd have to go to you.
Monica| Huh. So you're saying like umm, if there was an award for the best bad
massage, well who would get that?
Chandler| Oh, it would be you! You! Monica! And you'd get all the votes!
Monica| So maybe they could umm, call the award the Monica?
Chandler| Absolutely!
Monica| Okay. I suck!
Chandler| Yeah! (They hug.)
[Scene| Central Perk, Frank Sr. is just arriving.]
Phoebe| Umm, thank you for meeting with me.
Frank Sr.| Thank you. All right.
Phoebe| Come, sit. (He's hesitant.) Sit. (Still hesitating.) Sit! (He sits on
the arm of the couch.) Umm, all righty, before we get started I justI need you to
state for the official record that you are in fact Frank Buffay.
Frank Sr.| Oh yes. Yes, yes, I am, uh-hmm.
Phoebe| Okay.
Frank Sr.| So, what did Francis leave me?
Phoebe| Huh?
Frank Sr.| Well, that's why you wanted me to come, right?
Phoebe| Oh yes. Yes. Yeahno. She did. She left you umm, (looking in her
purse) this lipstick.
Frank Sr.| Oh. Huh. It's huh, well it's (opens it) oh it'sew used. Umm,
cool.
Phoebe| Okay. I have just a few questions to ask so I'm going to get out my
official forms. (She picks up a couple of crumpled receipts.) Okay, so, question 1) You
and uh, you were married to Francis' daughter Lilly, is that correct?
Frank Sr.| Yes, yes I was.
Phoebe| Okay, umm, question 2) Umm, did that marriage end A. Happily, B. Medium,
or C. In the total abandonment of her and her two children?
Frank Sr.| It really says that?!
Phoebe| Yeah. See? (Quickly shows him.)
Frank Sr.| Well then I guess then I-I would I would have to say C.
Phoebe| Hmm, okay, total abandonment. Okay, reasons for abandonment, A.
Top secret government work, B. Amnesia, or C. Or you're just a selfish, irresponsible bad,
bad man?
Frank Sr.| Y'know, I don't think I want the lipstick that much. (Gets up to
leave.) But umm Oh, would you do me a favor? And umm, would you, would you give
Lilly that, please? (Hands her a note.)
Phoebe| What?!
Frank Sr.| Well Lilly, when you see Lilly would you give her that, that note?
Because I wanted to talk to her at the memorial but, well I pictured her getting mad at me
the way you got mad at me and I well, I chickened out. So, uh, I wrote her that note,
would you give it to her please?
Phoebe| But you-you-you came to see Lilly?
Frank Sr.| Yeah, yeah. Why?
Phoebe| Lilly's dead. (He looks up in shock.)
Frank Sr.| She what?!
Phoebe| She's dead.
Frank Sr.| Are you sure?
Phoebe| Well, if she isn't then cremating her was a big mistake.
Frank Sr.| I can't believe this. I justI can't believe this.
How-howOh my God. How long ago?
Phoebe| 17 years ago.
Frank Sr.| Oh! What about, what about the girls?
Phoebe| Well, Ursula is a waitress and-and she lives in Soho. And Phoebe,
(pause) is on this couch.
Phoebe| Yep, lipstick and a daughter, big day for you!
Frank Sr.| Phoebe, I-I-I-umm, (Sits down next to her and brushes against her
leg.) Oops. (He backs up.) I just, I-I-I-I dont, I dont know what to say. I
just can't believe that you're my daughter, you're so pretty.
Phoebe| Yes. Well, that's neither here nor there.
Frank Sr.| So would it, would it make you feel better if I said I was very, very
sorry that I left?
Phoebe| Y'know what, it doesnt matter what you say it's not gonna make a
difference anyway, so you can just go.
Frank Sr.| All right. Well, y'know in my defense I was a lousy father.
Phoebe| That's a defense?
Frank Sr.| Yes. Yes it is. I burned the formula and I put your diapers on
backwards. I mean, I made up a song to sing you to sleep, but that made you cry even more!
Phoebe| You make up songs?
Frank Sr.| Well no, just-just that one. But, it was stupid. Let's see, how did
it, how did it go. Umm. (Singing.)
Frank Sr.| I just, I y'know, I'm not very good at this. So, umm (Backs
away.)
Phoebe| Well, I am. (Moves over and takes his hand.)
Phoebe| Not yet, no. (Drops his hand and moves back.)
[Scene| Monica and Rachel's, Joey returns from his audition and finds everyone but
Phoebe there.]
Joey| (dejected) Hi.
All| Hey!
Chandler| Hey man, how did the audition go?
Joey| Estelle said I didn't get it. (Sits down next to Rachel on the couch.)
Rachel| What?! Why? Joey you were so ready for it!
Joey| Yeah, I thought so too but, she said the casting people had some problems
with me.
Ross| What kind of problem?
Joey| Well to tell you the truth, they uh, (Pause) they had a problem with the
bag!
Chandler| Oh my God!
Ross| Nooooo!
Joey| Y'know what? It was a stupid play anyway!
Monica| Y'know, Joey, I think it's time to give up the bag.
Joey| I don't wanna give up the bag. I don't have to give up the bag! Do I Rach?
(She's avoiding his eyes.) Oh, you think I should give up the bag!
Rachel| Honey wait, Joey, Im sorry I mean as terrific as I think you are
with it (Looks for help.)
Chandler| Oh, hey! (Ross nods in agreement as well.)
Rachel| I just don't know if the world is ready for you and your bag.
Joey| I can't believe I'm hearing this!
Rachel| Wait a minute! Wait a minute! I'm not saying that you shouldnt
have a bag, I justit's just there are other bags that are a little less umm, (Pause)
controversial.
Chandler| Yeah umm, they're called wallets.
[Scene| Monica and Rachel's, everyone is eating some Chinese food.]
Phoebe| (looking out the window) Oh hey, you guys, look! Ugly Naked Guy is
putting stuff in boxes!
Rachel| I'd say from the looks of it; our naked buddy is moving.
Ross| Ironically, most of the boxes seem to be labeled clothes.
Rachel| Ohh, I'm gonna miss that big old squishy butt.
Chandler| And we're done with the chicken fried rice.
Ross| Hey! Hey! If he's moving, maybe I should try to get his place!
All| Good idea! Yes!
Ross| It would be so cool to live across from you guys!
Joey| Hey, yeah! Then we could do that telephone thing! Y'know, you have a can,
we have a can and it's connected by a string!
Chandler| Or we can do the actual telephone thing.
[Scene| Ugly Naked Guy's apartment, Ross, Rachel, and Phoebe are checking out the
place. Luckily, Ugly Naked Guy is nowhere to be seen.]
Ross| Oh my God! I love this apartment! Isn't it perfect?! I can't believe I
never realized how great it is!
Rachel| Well that is because your eye immediately goes to the big naked man.
Phoebe| It's amazing! You better hurry up and fill out an application or I'm
gonna beat you to it.
Ross| (laughing) Ohh. (Phoebe takes a couple of steps to the door and Ross
quickly hurries out.)
Rachel| Well, I never thought I'd say this, but I'm gonna go use Ugly Naked
Guy's bathroom. (Does so.)
Phoebe| (looking out the window) Oh, look! There's Monica and Chandler! (Starts
yelling.) Hey! Hey, you guys! Hey! (Chandler and Monica start taking each other's clothes
off.) Ohh!! Ohh! Ahh-ahhh!!
Rachel| What?!
Phoebe| (screaming) Ahhh!! Chandler and Monica!! Chandler and Monica!!
Rachel| Oh my God!
Phoebe| CHANDLER AND MONICA!!!!
Rachel| OH MY GOD!!!
Phoebe| OH!! MY EYES!!! MY EYES!!!!
Rachel| Phoebe!! Phoebe!! It's okay!! It's okay!!
Phoebe| NO! THEY'RE DOING IT!!!
Rachel| I KNOW!! I KNOW!! I KNOW!
Phoebe| YOU KNOW?!!!
Rachel| Yes, I know! And Joey knows! But Ross doesn't know so you have to stop
screaming!!
Ross| (entering) What's going on?
Phoebe and Rachel|
Rachel| (trying to divert his attention from the window by jumping up and down)
HI!! Hi!
Ross| What?! What?!
Rachel| Nothing! Oh God, we're just so excited that you want to get this
apartment!
Ross| Actually, it looks really good. (Turns towards the window and now Phoebe
starts jumping to divert his attention.)
Phoebe| (Screaming incoherently.) Get in here!!! (Motions to join her and
Rachel.)
[Scene| Central Perk, Phoebe and Rachel are there talking about Chandler and Monica.]
Phoebe| You mean whenever Monica and Chandler where like y'know doing laundry or
going grocery shopping orOh! All that time Monica spent on the phone with sad Linda
from camp!
Rachel| Uh-huh, doing it. Doing it. Phone doing it.
Phoebe| Oh! Oh, I can't believe it! I mean I think it's great! For him. She
might be able to do better.
Joey| (entering) Hey guys!
Rachel| Joey! Come here! Come here!
Joey| What? What?
Rachel| Phoebe just found out about Monica and Chandler.
Joey| You mean how they're friends and nothing more? (Glares at Rachel.)
Rachel| No. Joey, she knows! We were at Ugly Naked Guy's apartment and we
saw them doing it through the window. (Joey gasps) Actually, we saw them doing it up against
the window.
Phoebe| Okay, so now they know that you know and they don't know that Rachel
knows?
Joey| Yes, but y'know what? It doesn't matter who knows what. Now, enough of us
know that we can just tell them that we know! Then all the lying and the secrets would
finally be over!
Phoebe| Or, we could not tell them we know and have a little fun of our
own.
Rachel| Wh-what do you mean?
Phoebe| Well y'know every time that they say that like they're doing laundry
we'll just give them a bunch of laundry to do.
Rachel| Ohhh, I-I would enjoy that!
Joey| No-no-no! No-no wait Rach, you know what would even be more fun? Telling
them.
Rachel| Ehhh, no, I wanna do Phoebe's thing.
Joey| I can't take any
Phoebe| No! You don't have to do anything! Just don't tell them that we know!
Joey| Noo! I can't take any more secrets! (To Rachel) I've got your secrets.
I've got their secrets. I got secrets of my own y'know!
Rachel| You don't have any secrets!
Joey| Oh yeah? Well, you don't know about Hugsy, my bedtime penguin pal. (Joey
shies away.)
Rachel| (To Phoebe) So umm, how-how are we gonna mess with them?
Joey| Ugh.
Phoebe| Well, you could use your position y'know as the roommate.
Rachel| Okay.
Phoebe| And then. I would use y'know the strongest tool at my disposal. My
sexuality.
Chandler| (entering) Hello children!
All| Hey!
Phoebe| Okay, watch, learn, and don't eat my cookie.
Chandler| Hey.
Phoebe| Hey! Ooh, wow that jacket looks great on you!
Chandler| Really?
Phoebe| (feels his arm) Yeah the material feels so softhello Mr. Bicep!
Have you been working out?
Chandler| Well, I try to y'know, squeeze things. (Phoebe giggles
uncontrollably.) Are you okay?
Phoebe| Well, if you really wanna know, I'mOh! I can't tell you this.
Chandler| Phoebe, it's me. You can tell me anything.
Phoebe| Well actually you're the one person I can't tell this too. And the one
person I want to the most.
Chandler| What's going on?
Phoebe| I think it's just y'know that I haven't been with a guy in so long and
how sometimes you're looking for something and you just dont even see that it's
right there in front of you sipping coffeeOh no, have I said to much? Well it's just
something to think about. I know I will.
[Scene| Chandler's bedroom, Chandler and Monica are there, of course. Like who else
would it be, duh!]
Monica| You are so cute! How did you get to be so cute?
Chandler| Well, my Grandfather was Swedish and my Grandmother was actually a
tiny little bunny.
Monica| Okay, now you're even cuter!!
Chandler| Y'know that is a popular opinion today I must say.
Monica| What?
Chandler| The weirdest thing happened at the coffee house, I think, I think
Phoebe was hitting on me.
Monica| What are you talking about?
Chandler| I'm telling you I think Phoebe thinks I'm foxy.
Monica| That's not possible!
Chandler| Ow!
Monica| I'm sorry it's just, Phoebe just always thought you were, you were
charming in a, in a sexless kind of way.
Chandler| Oh, y'know I-I can't hear that enough.
Monica| I'm sorry, I think that you just misunderstood her.
Chandler| No, I didn't misunderstand, okay? She was all over me! She touched my
bicep for crying out loud!
Monica| This bicep?
Chandler| Well it's not flexed right now!
[Scene| Monica and Rachel's, Monica, Rachel, Phoebe, and Chandler are there. Monica is
entering from her room.]
Rachel| Hey Mon, what are you doing now? Wanna come see a movie with us?
Monica| Uhh, y'know actually I was gonna do some laundry.
Rachel| Oh.
Monica| Hey Chandler, wanna do it with me?
Chandler| Sure, I'll do it with ya.
Monica| Okay.
Rachel| Okay great, hold on a sec! (She runs to her room and returns carrying a
huge bag of laundry.) Oh, here you go! You don't mind do ya? That would really help me out
a lot! Thanks!
Monica| I mean I-I don't I think I have enough quarters.
Phoebe| I have quarters! (She holds up a bag of quarters.)
Ross| (entering) Hey!
Rachel| Hey Ross! Any word on the apartment yet?
Ross| Well, I called over there and it turns out Ugly Naked Guy is subletting it
himself and he's already had like a hundred applicants.
Rachel| Oh.
Ross| No-no, I got the edge. I know it's not exactly ethical but I sent him a
little bribe to
Monica| Oh, is it that pinball machine with the big bow on it?
Ross| No.
Chandler| That new mountain bike?
Ross| No.
Monica| Well what did you send?
Ross| A basket of mini-muffins.
Phoebe| But there's a whole table of mini-muffin baskets. Which one did you
send?
Ross| The small one.
Rachel| What?! You-you actually thought that basket was gonna get you the
apartment?
Ross| Well yeah! Someone sent us a basket at work once and people went crazy
over those little muffins. It was the best day.
Chandler| Your work makes me sad.
Ross| Oh man! I want that place so much!! I was so sure that was gonna work!
There's twelve bucks I'll never see again! (Exits.)
Rachel| All right honey, we'd better go if we wanna catch that movie.
Monica| Bye!
All| Bye!
Phoebe| Bye Chandler! (She walks up to him.) (Quietly.) I miss you already. (She
pinches his butt.)
Chandler| (after they've left) Okay, did you see that?! With the inappropriate
and the pinching!!
Monica| Actually, I did!
Chandler| Okay, so now do you believe that she's attracted to me?
Monica| Ohhh, oh my God! Oh my God! She knows about us!
Chandler| Are you serious?
Monica| Phoebe knows and she's just trying to freak us out! That's the only
explanation for it!
Chandler| (a little hurt) Okay but what about y'know my pinchable butt and my
bulging bicepsShe knows!
[Scene| Chandler, Joey, and Ross's, Joey is snoozing with Hugsy, his bedtime penguin
pal and Chandler and Monica come storming in.]
Chandler| (entering) Joey!
Joey| Yeah?
Chandler| Phoebe knows about us!
Joey| Well I didn't tell them!
Monica| Them?! Who's them?
Joey| Uhhh, Phoebe and Joey.
Monica| Joey!
Joey| And Rachel. I would've told you but they made me promise not to tell!
Chandler| Oh man!
Joey| I'm sorry! But hey, it's over now, right? Because you can tell them that
you know they know and I can go back to knowing absolutely nothing!
Monica| Unless
Joey| No! Not unless! Look this must end now!
Monica| Oh man, they think they are so slick messing with us! But see
they don't know that we know that they know! So
Chandler| Ahh yes, the messers become the messies!
[Scene| Monica and Rachel's, Ross is looking at Ugly Naked Guy's apartment through
binoculars.]
Ross| Noooo.
Rachel| Oh Ross, honey you gotta stop torturing yourself!
Phoebe| Yeah, why don't you just find another apartment?
Ross| Look I've already looked at like a thousand apartments this month and none
of them even compares to that one!
Rachel| Y'know what you should do?
Ross| Huh?
Rachel| You should find out what his hobbies are and then use that to bond with
him. Yeah! Like if I would strike up a conversation about say umm, sandwiches. Or uh, or
my underwear.
Joey| I'm listening.
Rachel| (To Ross) See?
Ross| That is a great idea! And! I know Ugly Naked Guy because we've been
watching him for like five years so that gives me back my edge! Oh, let's see now
he had the trampoline.
Phoebe| He broke that.
Ross| Well, he had gravity boots.
Rachel| Yeah, he broke those too.
Joey| So he likes to break stuff.
Ross| Okay, I've got to go pick up Ben but I-I will figure something out. (He
opens the door and stops.) Hey, didn't he used to have a cat?
Phoebe| I wouldn't bring that up, it would probably just bum him out.
Joey| Yeah, poor cat, never saw that big butt coming.
Ross| Right. (Exits.)
Rachel| Hello! (Listens) Oh yeah! Hey! Hold on a second she's right here! (To
Phoebe) It's Chandler.
Phoebe| (in a sexy voice) Oh? (Takes the phone from Rachel.) Hello you.
Chandler| Hello Phoebe, I've been thinking about you all day. (He's holding the
phone so that Monica can hear it as well.)
Phoebe| Eh?
Chandler| Well you know that thing you said before, I'd be lying if I said I
wasn't intrigued.
Phoebe| Really?
Chandler| Yeah, listen, Joey isn't gonna be here tonight so why don't you come
over and I'll let you uh, feel my bicep. Or maybe more.
Phoebe| I'll have to get back to you on that. Okay, bye! (Hangs up.) Oh my God!
He wants me to come over and feel his bicep and more!
Rachel| Are you kidding?!
Phoebe| No!
Rachel| I can not believe he would do that to MonWhoa! (She stops suddenly
and slowly turns to point at Joey. Joey is avoiding her eyes.) Joey, do they know that we
know?
Joey| No.
Rachel| Joey!
Joey| They know you know.
Rachel| Ugh, I knew it! Oh I cannot believe those two!
Phoebe| God, they thought they can mess with us! They're trying to mess with
us?! They don't know that we know they know we know! (Joey just shakes his head.) Joey,
you can't say anything!
Joey| I couldn't even if I wanted too.
[Scene| Outside Ugly Naked Guy's apartment, Ross is knocks on the door and Ugly Naked
Guy answers it. He's ugly. He's naked. And he's holding a huge jumbo soda.]
Ross| Good evening, sir. My name is Ross Geller. I'm one of the people who
applied for the apartment. And I-I realize that the competition is fierce butI'm
sorry. I, I can't help but notice you're naked and (He claps his hands.) I applaud you.
Man, I wish I was naked. I mean, this-this looks so great. That is how God intended it.
[Scene| Monica and Rachel's, Chandler and Monica and Rachel and Phoebe are planning
their respective strategies to break the other pairing. Joey is not amused.
Monica| (in the kitchen with Chandler) Look at them, they're-they're panicked!
Chandler| Oh yeah, they're totally gonna back down!
Monica| Oh yeah!
Phoebe| All right. All right! If he wants a date? He's gonna get a date. All
right, I'm gonna go in.
Rachel| All right. Be sexy.
Phoebe| (laughs) Please.
Phoebe| So Chandler, I-I'd love to come by tonight.
Chandler| (initially worried, but gets over it) Really?
Phoebe| Oh absolutely. Shall we say, around seven?
Chandler| Yes.
Phoebe| Good. I'm really looking forward to you and me having sexual
intercourse.
Joey| (looking out the window) Hey-hey, check it out! Check it out! Ugly Naked
Guy has a naked friend!
Rachel| Oh yeah! (She gasps.) Oh my God! That is our friend! (Monica
covers her face.) It's Naked Ross! (Monica turns and buries her face in Chandler's
shoulder.)
All| Yeah, it is! Naked Ross!!
[Scene| Monica and Rachel's, Rachel is getting Phoebe ready for her date.]
Rachel| Show time!
Phoebe| Okay, Rachel, get me perfume!
Rachel| Okay! (She runs to get some.)
Phoebe| And Joey, get me a bottle of wine and glasses? (He begrudgingly does
so.)
Monica| All right, it'll be great! You just make her think you wanna have sex
with her! It'll totally freak her out!
Chandler| Okay, listen, how far am I gonna have to go with her?
Monica| Relax, she-she's gonna give in way before you do!
Chandler| How do you know?!
Monica| Because you're on my team! And my team always wins!
Chandler| At this?!
Monica| Just go get some! (Kisses him.) Go! (She runs to hide in the bathroom.)
Rachel| (handing her the wine) Okay honey, now I'm gonna try to listen from
right here!
Phoebe| Okay.
Rachel| Okay? Whoa, wait! (She undoes one button on Phoebe's dress.)
Phoebe| Good idea!
Rachel| Yeah, oh wait! (She goes for another one.)
Phoebe| Oh now, don't give away the farm!
Chandler| Phoebe.
Phoebe| Chandler.
Chandler| Come on in.
Phoebe| I was going too. (They go inside and he closes the door.) Umm, I brought
some wine. Would you like some?
Chandler| Sure.
Phoebe| So, here we are. Nervous?
Chandler| Me? No. You?
Phoebe| No, I want this to happen.
Chandler| So do I.
Chandler| I'm gonna put on some music.
Phoebe| Maybe, maybe I'll dance for you. (She starts doing a rather suggestive
and seductive dance that's silly at the same time.)
Chandler| You look good.
Phoebe| Thanks! Y'know, that when you say things like that it makes me wanna rip
that sweater vest right off!
Chandler| Well, why don't we move this into the bedroom?
Phoebe| Really?
Chandler| Oh, do you not want to?
Phoebe| No. No! It's just y'know first, I wanna take off all my clothes and have
you rub lotion on me.
Chandler| (swallowing hard) Well that would be nice. I'll go get the lotion.
Chandler| Listen, this is totally getting out of hand! Okay? She wants me to put
lotion on her!
Monica| She's bluffing!
Chandler| Look, she's not backing down! She went like this! (He does a little
mimic of her dance.)
Phoebe| He's not backing down. He went to get lotion.
Joey| (entering the hall) Oh man! Aren't you guys done yet?! I wanna sit in my
chair!
Rachel| Joey look, just look at it this way, the sooner Phoebe breaks Chandler
the sooner this is all over and out in the open.
Joey| Ooh!
Rachel| Okay!
Joey| I like that! (To Phoebe) Oh, okay! Show him your bra! He's afraid of bras!
Can't work 'em! (He swiftly rips open the front of Phoebe's dress revealing her bra.)
Phoebe| Joey! (Examining the dress.) Wow, you didnt rip off any buttons.
Joey| It's not my first time.
Monica| You go back out there and you seduce her till she cracks!
Chandler| Okay, give me a second! (Pause) Did you clean up in here?
Monica| Of course.
Chandler| Oh, you're-you're going?
Phoebe| Umm, not without you, lover. (She slowly walks over to him and is
showcasing her bra.) So, this is my bra.
Chandler| (swallowing hard) It's very, very nice. Well, come here. I'm very were
gonna be having all the sex.
Phoebe| You should be. I'm very bendy. (Pause) I'm gonna kiss you now.
Chandler| Not if I kiss you first.
Phoebe| Ooh.
Chandler| Well, I guess there's nothing left for us to do but-but kiss.
Phoebe| Here it comes. Our first kiss.
Chandler| Okay! Okay! Okay! You win! You win!! I can't have sex with ya!
Phoebe| And why not?!
Chandler| Because I'm in love with Monica!!
Phoebe| You're-you're what?!
Chandler| Love her! That's right, ILOVEHER!!! I love her!! (They
walk together and hug.) I love you, Monica.
Monica| I love you too Chandler. (They kiss.)
Phoebe| I justI thought you guys were doing it, I didn't know you were in
love!
Joey| Dude!
Chandler| And hats off to Phoebe. Quite a competitor. (Pause) And might I say
your breasts are still showing.
Phoebe| God! (She turns and buttons up.)
Joey| All right! So that's it! It's over! Everybody knows!
Monica| Well actually, Ross doesn't.
Chandler| Yes, and we'd appreciate it if no one told him yet.
[Scene| Ross's new apartment, he is showing his boss, Dr. Ledbetter his new place and
new outlook on life.]
Ross| A new place for a new Ross. I'm gonna have you and all the guys from work
over once it's y'know, furnished.
Dr. Ledbetter| I must say it's nice to see you back on your feet.
Ross| Well I am that. And that whole rage thing is definitely behind me.
Dr. Ledbetter| I wonder if its time for you to rejoin our team at the museum?
Ross| Oh Donald that-that would be great. I am totally ready to come back to
work. IWhat? (He notices something through the window.) No! Wh What are you
doing?!! (Dr. Ledbetter is slowly backing away.) GET OFF MY SISTER!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Ross| Chandler!!! Chandler!!! (He opens the door to the apartment but is stopped
by the chain; Chandler and Monica quickly stop making out and try to get dressed.)
Chandler, I saw what you were doing through the window! Chandler, I saw what you were
doing to my sister! Now get out here!
Chandler| (To Monica) Wow! Listen, we had a good run. What was it? Four? Five
months? I mean, that's more than most people have in a lifetime! So, good-bye, take care,
bye-bye then! (He kisses her and starts to climb out the balcony window.)
Monica| What are you doing?!
Chandler| Oh, I'm going on the lamb.
Monica| Come on Chandler, come on, I can handle Ross. (They go to the door. Ross
is trying to stick his hand through and undo the chain; Monica pushes his hand back.) (To
Ross) Hold on! (She opens the door.) Hey Ross. What's up bro?
Ross| What the hell are doing?!!
Rachel| (running from the guy's apartment with Joey in tow) Hey, what's-what's
going on?!
Chandler| Well, I think, I think Ross knows about me and Monica.
Joey| (panicking) Dude! He's right there!
Ross| (To Chandler) I thought you were my best friend, this is my sister! My
best friend and my sister! I-I cannot believe this!
Chandler| Look, we're not just messing around! I love her. Okay, I'm in love
with her.
Monica| I'm so sorry that you had to find out this way. I'm sorry, but it's
true, I love him too.
Ross| (happily) My best friend and my sister! I cannot believe this. (He hugs
them both.) (To Joey and Rachel) You guys probably wanna get some hugs in too, huh? Big
news!
Rachel| Awww, no, it's okay, we've actually known for a while.
Ross| What? What? What?! You guys knew? (Joey and Rachel backup against the
door.) You all knew and you didn't tell me?!!
Rachel| Well, Ross, we were worried about you. We didn't know how you were going
to react.
Ross| (happily again) You were worried about me? You didn't know how I was going
to react? (He hugs them both.)
Joey| Okay, all right, whew! What do you say we all clear out of here and let
these two lovebirds get back down to business? (Ross turns and glares at him.)
Hey-hey-hey, I-I-I'm just talking here, he-he's the one doing your sister.
[Scene| Central Perk, everyone is there.]
Ross| Hey, you know what I just realized? If you guys ever have kids
Chandler| (interrupting) Whoa-whoa-whoa! We're having kids?!
Joey| (quickly) I call Godfather!
Ross| You can't just call Godfather. Don't you think her brother should
be Godfather?
Joey| Sure, if you cared enough to call it first.
Monica| Guys, you're a few steps ahead of us.
Chandler| Yeah, big zero gravity moon steps.
Rachel| Oh! Oh, I just thought of the greatest wedding gift to get you.
Phoebe| Ooh, I'll go in on that with you! I couldn't think of anything.
Rachel| Okay.
Joey| (to her) Oh, hey Katie! Everyone, this is Katie.
Katie| Hi!
All| Hi!
Joey| So, are you ready to go?
Katie| Yeah, I just gotta run to the bathroom.
Joey| Oh sure, right back there. (Points.)
Katie| Hey, where are we going to lunch?
Joey| I was thinking Chinese food.
Katie| Ohh, I love Chinese! How did you know I love Chinese?! (She hits
him repeatedly as she says that.)
Rachel| She is so cute! You could fit her right in your little pocket!
Joey| I don't know. I mean I like her a lot, and she's really nice, but
Monica| But what?
Joey| (shyly) She keeps punching me.
Monica| In that cute, little, sweet way she just did?
Joey| Hey, it's a lot harder than it looks! Okay? (Quietly) She-she-she's
hurting me.
Monica| I know what you need, you need a bodyguard. Hey Ross, what is Ben doing
after preschool?
Chandler| Hey listen, come on, Joey is having a problem! A little girl is
beating him up.
Rachel| Aww, Joey, come here. (She takes his hand.) Look honey, I know this must
be really, really difficult for you and I--Oh, I'm sorry. Am I hurting you?
[Scene| Ross's apartment, he's unpacking after moving in. There's a knock on the door
and he answers it.]
Ross| (opens it to reveal Phoebe) Hey!
Phoebe| Hey! I brought you some house warming gifts.
Ross| Aww.
Phoebe| Yeah. Salt, so your life always has flavor.
Ross| Huh.
Phoebe| Bread, so you never go hungry.
Ross| Ohh.
Phoebe| And a scented candle for the bathroom, because well, y'know.
Ross| Thanks. Thanks. And thanks again.
Phoebe| Yeah!
Guy|
Ross| Hi!
Guy|
Ross| Oh hi! Ross Geller. And this is my friend Phoebe.
Steve| Oh hi Phoebe.
Phoebe| Mr. President.
Steve| I came to talk to you about Howard.
Ross| Howard?
Steve| Yeah, he's the handy man. He's gonna be retiring next week and everyone
who lives here is kicking in a 100 bucks as a thank you for all the hard work type of
thing.
Ross| Oh that's nice.
Steve| Yeah. So, do you want to give a check? Or
Ross| Oh. Uhh
Steve| Oh look, you don't have to give it too me right now! You can slip it
under my door. (Points to his apartment across the hall.)
Ross| No-no, it's not that, it's just I-I just moved in.
Steve| Well, the guy's worked here for 25 years.
Ross| Yes, but I've lived here for 25 minutes.
Steve| Oh, okay, I get it. (Starts to leave.)
Ross| No wait, look. Look! I'm sorry, it's just I've never even met
Howard. I-I mean I don't know Howard.
Steve| Howard's the handy man!
Ross| Yes but too me he's just, man.
Steve| Okay, fine, whatever. Welcome to the building. (Exits.)
Ross| (To Phoebe) Ugh, can you believe that guy!
Phoebe| Yeah. I really like his glasses.
[Scene| Chandler and Joey's, Ross is lamenting to Chandler and Rachel about his
troubles in his new building.]
Ross| so then President Steve told everyone that I was a cheapskate, and
now the whole building hates me! A little kid spit on my knee! Y'know what I'm gonna do?
I'm gonna throw a party. That's right. For everyone in the building, and I'm gonna sit
them down and explain to them, I am not a bad guy. I am not a cheap guy! I'm just a guy
who-who stands up for what he believes in. A man with principles.
Chandler| (To Rachel) Sounds like a fun party.
Rachel| Hmm. Look, Ross, if you want your neighbors to like you, why don't you
just pay the hundred bucks? The party's gonna cost you way more than that.
Ross| It doesn't matter! It's my principles! We're talking about my principles!
Rachel| Okay, I thought it was about your neighbors liking you.
Ross| Oh, they'll like me. Once they come to my awesome PAR-TAY! Okay, I gotta
run. I gotta go get some nametags. (Exits.)
Rachel| And that crazy party animal will be your brother-in-law.
Chandler| Very, very funny, but don't say things like that in front of Monica. I
don't want you putting any ideas in her head.
Rachel| Umm, Chandler, you do realize that those ideas are probably
already in Monica's head.
Chandler| Wh-wh-why?!
Rachel| Well, because she loves you and because you love her.
Chandler| Yeah, so, what's that supposed to mean?!
Rachel| Hey, Chandler, don't freak out! I'm telling you something you already
know! Come on, she broke up with Richard because he didn't want to have babies. And she's
a woman, and she's almost 30, and y'know it's Monica.
Chandler| I don't see it that way. Okay? Because, I see two Monicas, the one
that was my friend, who lived across the hall, and wanted to have a lot of babies and then
the new Monica, who I just started to date. Now, who's to say what she wants?!
Im right. I'm right. Am I right?
Rachel| No, you're right, you are absolutely right. I mean that makes, that
makes everything different.
Chandler| Okay. It's not different at all, is it?
Rachel| Not unless different means the same.
[Scene| Central Perk, Joey is sitting on the couch with Katie.]
Katie| You were so funny with that waiter! You're such a nut! (She slaps her
thighs, Joey jerks, and spills some of his coffee.)
Joey| (sets the coffee down) Y'know, breadstick fangs are always funny.
Katie| No, you make them funny. You're the funny one! (She punches him again and
he retreats to the arm of the couch.)
Joey| Uhh, look Katie, uh listen, we-we need to talk. Okay? Umm, look I like
you. I-I really do, I like you a lot. Okay? But sometimes when you, when you playfully
punch me like that it-it feels like someone's hitting me with a very tiny but very real
bat.
Katie| Aww, like I could hurt you. Are you making fun of my size? Don't make fun
of me because of my size! (She punches him again and almost knocks him off the arm of the
couch.)
[Scene| Chandler and Joey's, Chandler and Monica are curled up on one of the chairs.]
Monica| Isn't this great?
Chandler| Hmm.
Monica| Couldn't you just stay like this forever? (His eyes snap open.)
Chandler! Couldn't you just stay here forever?
Chandler| Yeah, here, somewhere else, y'know where-where ever. (Gets up.)
Monica| Are you okay?
Chandler| Yeah, I'm cool. Casual.
Monica| What-what are you doing?
Chandler| I'm just hanging out. Y'know, having fun. Y'know with the girl that
I'm seeing casually.
Monica| Man, I knew it! I knew you were going to do this!!
Chandler| What?!
Monica| Get all freaked out because everybody was talking and just joking around
about marriage and stuff.
Chandler| Well, you do want all that stuff, right?
Monica| Oh and you know what I want!
Chandler| Yes! You want babies! You have baby fever!
Monica| I do not have baby fever!
Chandler| Oh please, you are obsessed with babies and-and marriage and
everything that's related to babies and-and marriage! I've got an idea, why don't we turn
down the heat on this pressure cooker?!
Monica| Have you lost your mind? Chandler, this isn't about me! This is about
you and all your weird relationship commitment crap!
Chandler| Nah-uh! I know you! Okay? I know the thoughts that you have in the
head--in your head!
Monica| You don't know everything. Did you know that I'm going out with Rachel
tonight instead of you? Hmm? And did you know that the only baby around here is you?! And
did you know that I can't even look at you right now?! (She storms out.)
Chandler| Well, I did not know that.
[Scene| Central Perk, Chandler is getting advice from Ross and Joey.]
Chandler| It's gonna be okay, right? I mean she's not gonna leave me? This is,
this is fixable.
Ross and Joey|
Chandler| By me?
Ross| Oh, no!
Joey| No-no.
Ross| Well, unless you make some kind of big gesture.
Joey| Yeah, big!
Joey| Uh-oh, shht! The Misses.
Monica| Gunther, can I get a coffee (Looks at Chandler) to go?
Chandler| Monica. (Goes to talk to her.)
Monica| I'm still not done not wanting to talk to you.
Chandler| Just tell me what I need to do to make things right.
Monica| What?!
Chandler| Well, that's what we do. Y'know, I-I mess up and then you tell me how
to fix it and then I do and then y'know you think I'm all cute again.
Monica| Really? I'm really tired of being your relationship tutor. You're gonna
have to figure this one for yourself. All right? Y'know what? If you're too afraid to be
in a real relationship, then don't be in one. (She walks out.)
[Scene| Ross's apartment, he's having his party, only he's the only guest. He gets up
and puts on a nametag that says Ross, but doesn't quite like it. So he takes it off and
puts on one that says Dr. Geller and he puts the Ross one underneath the Dr. Geller one.
Then as he turns off the music, we hear the party for Howard raging in the apartment
across the hall.]
Party Guests|
Ross| Phoebe! (He grabs her arm to get her attention.)
Phoebe| Oh, hi Ross!
Ross| What are you doing?
Phoebe| Oh, I thought this was your party and it turns out its a party for
Howard. He's just the sweetest little man! (A guest walks up to her.)
Guest #1| See ya Phoebe! Oh and hey, thanks for chipping in!
Ross| You chipped in?!
Phoebe| Yeah, uh-huh, a 100 dollars.
Ross| Phoebe! I can't believe you gave them money! I thought you agreed it was
totally unreasonable that they asked me for that money!
Phoebe| Yeah, but they didn't ask me! Y'know? This way I'm just y'know, the
exotic, generous stranger. That's always fun to be.
Ross| Yeah, but you're making me look bad!
Phoebe| No I'm not. No! If anything I'm making you look better! They'll see you
talking to me and that's--I'm a hit!
Steve| (walking up) Oh hey, Pheebs!
Phoebe| Hey!
Steve| Oh hey, Ross. Umm, see, I was thinking maybe you two could switch
apartments because Phoebe's more our kind of people. Something to think about. (Walks
away.)
Phoebe| Yeah, okay, my bad.
[Scene| Central Perk, Rachel is getting some coffee as Joey enters. He's looking a
little puffy, but that's probably from the large number of different color sweaters he's
wearing.]
Joey| Hey!
Rachel| Hi! Wow! You look, you lookbig.
Joey| Thanks! I've been working out. Hey listen, is it obvious that I'm wearing
six sweaters?
Rachel| Uhhh, yeah. But it's not obvious why.
Joey| Well look, Im breaking up with Katie so I had to put on some extra
padding. Y'know? I mean, if she hits me when she's happy, can you imagine how hard she's
gonna hit me when I tell her I'm taking away the Joey love?
Katie| (entering) Hi!
Joey| Hey! Hiya!
Rachel| Hey! Hey, cute jacket!
Katie| Oh, thanks! That's so sweet! (She punches Rachel like she punched Joey.)
Rachel| Oh! Ow! (Joey motions, "You see what I mean?!")
Katie| Oh, ow! Did Joey tell you to say that? You guys, (Punches Joey) are too
much! (Punches Rachel.)
Rachel| Whoa! (Laughs) Y'know what Katie? I gotta tell ya I-I-I-I think you are
the one who is too much. (She punches Katie back.)
Katie| Ohh, Joey has the nicest friends! (She punches Rachel.)
Rachel| Ohh, and the nicest girlfriend! (She retaliates.)
Katie| You're so sweet! (Punches Rachel yet again.)
Rachel| Ohh, you're so sweet! (She kicks Katie in the shin.)
Katie| Oww!!!! Joey, she just kicked me.
Joey| Huh.
Katie| Well? Aren't you gonna do something?
Joey| Uhh.
Katie| You'd better do something, or I'm gonna walk out that door right now!
Well? Are you gonna?
Joey| Nah.
[Scene| Howard's party, Phoebe is talking Ross up to two more partygoers. Ross isn't
happy about it.]
Ross| (trying to get her attention) Phoebe?
Phoebe| (ignoring him and continuing her conversation) That's what I'm saying.
(Laughs.)
Ross| (tapping her on the shoulder) Phoebe? Phoebe?
Phoebe| Ooh. (Turns to him.)
Ross| Look, this is a disaster! Can't I please just go?
Phoebe| No! No! I'm talking you up to people. Just give it a little time, all
right? Relax, get something to eat! Okay?
Ross| So uh, what did you tell them about me?
Phoebe| Oh, I was telling them about you and Emily. Y'know, try to get some
sympathy.
Ross| Ohh. (He cuts himself a piece of cake.)
Phoebe| But somehow you came off as the bad guy.
Ross| What?!
Phoebe| Yeah, I think I told it wrong. Y'know, we should talk about that because
I don't totally understand what happened there.
Ross| (trying a piece of cake) Ohh, this cake is really good!
Phoebe| Oh, okay, see? Things are looking up already!
Guest #2| (sees the cake) Oh my God! Someone cut Howard's cake! (Ross tries
dumping it into a nearby plant.) Who would do a think like that?
Steve| 3-B!
All| Oh yeah, aww!
Steve| Okay, you got your free food! You ruined everyone's fun! Don't you think
it's time you went home?!
Guest #3| Yeah, leave!
All| Yeah, get out! Now!
Steve| Go back to 3-B, 3-B!
Phoebe| All right, everyone calm down! Everyone calm down! I have something that
I would like to say! Who here likes Ross? (Ross is the only one who raises his hand and
Phoebe glares at him to put his hand back down.) Of course you don't like him! He-he
didn't give you any money, he raised his own hand when I asked, "Who hear likes
Ross," and he's wearing two nametags! (He takes one off.) I-I'll be honest with you
guys, when I first met Ross I didn't like him at all! But then once I got to know him I
saw that he's really sweet and caring and very generous. I mean, all I'm saying is
don't judge Ross before you get to know him all right? I mean, I like all you guys now,
but when I first meet you y'know Kurt, I thought, y'know abrasive drunk, umm Lola, mind
numbingly stupid! And okay, you guys (She turns to an elderly gentleman and a 20 something
woman, who're a couple.) (To the girl) Gold-digger, (To the old guy) cradle robbing perv!
So, I think you all know what I mean.
[Scene| Ross's apartment, Ross and Phoebe have been banished to Ross's place.]
Phoebe| Obviously I didn't think they were gonna start throwing things. I just
thought if I kept insulting everyone, you would jump in and defend everyone and then you
could look like the hero.
Ross| Oh wow, yeah! See, I did not get that.
[Scene| Monica and Rachel's, Chandler comes running in. Everyone else is already
there.]
Chandler| Where's Monica?! Where is she? I need to talk to her! It's urgent! Is
she here?
Monica| (raising her hand) I'm Monica.
Chandler| I need to talk to you, it's urgent!
Monica| Okay.
Chandler| Okay, I've been doing a lot of thinking about us, y'know a lot of uhh,
us thinking. And uh, well I guess there's only one-one way to do this. (He slowly and
awkwardly gets down on one knee.)
Monica| Wait what-wh-wh-what are you doing?!
Chandler| (getting out a ring box) Monica
Monica| No-no, don't-don't-don't do it!
Chandler| Will you marry me?
Ross| Oh-no. No. No.
Joey| What a bad idea!
Rachel| Ohhhh, I cannot look at it! (She doesn't move.)
Monica| Chandler, why are you doing this?
Chandler| I don't know. But I know I'm not afraid to do this.
Monica| Chandler.
Chandler| I'm doing this because I'm sorry?
Monica| Do you umm, you really think the best reason to get married is because
you're sorry?
Chandler| No, the best reason to get married is pregnancy. Sorry is pretty much
fourth y'know, behind being ready and actually wanting to get married. (Laughs.)
Will you be my wife?
Monica| (kneels with him) Chandler, umm, I want you to take just a minute and I
want you to think about how ridiculous this sounds.
Chandler| Yeah, I'm kinda wishing everyone wasn't here right now.
Monica| Honey! Do you know that none of that stuff came from me?! I mean I never
said I wanted to have babies and get married right now!
Chandler| Yeah I know, but I was really confused and then I talked to these
guys. (Turns to look at Ross and Joey.)
Monica| Who? Two divorces and Joey?!
Ross| Hey!
Joey| She's right y'know.
Ross| Yeah, but still, cheap shot!
Monica| Y'know what? Y'know when I said that I want you to deal with this
relationship stuff all on your own? Well, you're not ready for that.
Chandler| I didn't think I was!
Monica| Oh my God, what would have done if I said yes?
Chandler| Well I would've been happy because I would've be able to spend the
rest of my life with the woman that I love. Or, you would've seen a Chandler shaped hole
in that door. (Points at the door.)
[Scene| Central Perk, Everyone is there.]
Joey| Hey Ross, will you pass me that knife?
Ross| No, I will not!
Joey| Oh, it's okay. You don't have to be so mean about it.
Ross| You're right, I'm sorry. Will you marry me?
Phoebe| Aw, and I was gonna ask you to marry me because I forgot to say hello to
you last week.
Rachel| Oh no wait Pheebs, I think for something like that you just ask them to
move in with you. But I'm not sure, Chandler?
Chandler| Okay, how long is this going to go on.
Monica| Well I think the length of teasing is directly related to how insane you
were so, a long time.
Ross| This is fun. Hey Rach, remember that whole "We were on a break
thing?" Well, I'm sorry, will you marry me? (Laughs--whines as he sees that no one is
laughing. They're just staring at him in shock.)
Chandler| That's not funny.
Joey| That's not funny at all!

a crossword puzzle.]
Joey| Hey!
Chandler| Hey!
Monica| Hey!
Joey| What are you guys doing up?
Chandler| Oh, we wanted to finish the crossword before we went to bed. Hey, do
you know a six-letter word for red?
Joey| (thinks) Dark red.
Chandler| Yeah, I think that's wrong, but there's a Connect the Dots in here for
you later. (To Monica) Hey, how about maroon?
Monica| (checks to see if it works) Yes, you are so smart! (Kisses him.)
Joey| Aww, you guys are so cute!
Monica| I know.
Joey| All right, I'll see you in the morning.

[Scene| Central Perk, everyone is there but Ross and Joey. Gunther hands them the bill,
and Chandler gives some money to pay it.]
Rachel| (looking at the bill) Uhh, we still need a tip.
Phoebe| All right. Hold on. (She starts digging in the chair.) I got it. Nickel!
(Donates it.) How much more do we need?
Rachel| A couple of bucks.
Phoebe| Okay, dime! (Donates that.) You guys should probably keep talking; this
could take a while. (Finds something else.) Oh no, wait! Look it! Whoa! (Looks at it.) Oh
my God, this is a police badge!
Monica| Wow!
Chandler| Oh that's so cool! Why would a cop come in here though? They don't
serve donuts. (No one laughs.) Y'know what actually, could you discover the badge again? I
think I can come up with something better than that.
Rachel| Phoebe, I bet somebody's missing that badge.
Phoebe| Yeah, I should probably take it back. Ooh, but you know what? While I'm
at the police station, I could check their Ten Most Wanted lists because my friend Fritzy
has been like number 11 forever, so this could be her year! (She crosses her fingers in
hope.)
Joey| (entering) Hey, you guys!
Chandler| Hey!
Rachel| Hey Joey!
Monica| Hey.
Joey| (To Monica) Hey. That uh, that my sweatshirt?
Monica| Oh yes, it is. I'm sorry I borrowed it, I was cold. I hope its okay?
Joey| Well uh, it's just that uh, y'know if-if you're gonna be wearing someone's
sweatshirt shouldn't it be your boyfriends--and Im not him.
Monica| I'm sorry, I'll give it back to you.
Joey| No-no! No! I mean it's gonna be all smelling like Monica!
Monica| Are you saying I smell bad?
Joey| No! No, you smell like a meadow. (Pause.) I'm sorry. (Runs to the
bathroom.)
Monica| What's with him?
Chandler| Oh, y'know what? The last time Joey went to a meadow, his mother was
shot by a hunter.
[Scene| A couch store, Ross is trying to decide on a new couch for his place. He has
dragged Rachel along for the trip, and she's not too happy about it. Ross is sitting on it
in different ways to see how it feels. He tries to just sit on it normally, and then he
tries flopping on it. One thing about this couch, it's huge. It's like twice the size of a
normal full size couch. Whoever designed this thing, needs help and fast.]
Rachel| (disgusted at Ross's antics) Ugh!
Ross| (To Rachel) Yeah, I still don't know. (To the salesman who is hovering
nearby) I'm sorry I just wanna make sure that I bought the right couch. I need a couch
that says, "Kids welcome here." But that also says, (In a sexy voice) "Come
here to me!"
Rachel| What?! You say that to kids?!!
Ross| No! No! No! The "Come here to me" is y'know for the ladies.
Rachel| Ross, honey, it's a nice couch. It's not a magic couch.
The Salesman| You picked a great couch.
Ross| Yeah?
The Salesman| Yeah. Could you just sign right here please? (Hands him a
clipboard.)
Ross| Oh, sure. Whoa-whoa, what's this? The delivery charge is almost as much as
the couch!
Rachel| Wait! No, that's ridiculous. Come on, he lives three blocks away!
Ross| Yeah, y'know what? I'll take it myself, thank you! (He signs the form and
hands it back to the salesman.) All right Rach, let's go! (He picks up one end of the
couch.)
Rachel| Yeah! (She puts on her coat and turns around and sees Ross is expecting
her to help.) (Laughing.) Are you kiddin'?
Ross| Oh, come on it's only three blocks! And-and, it's not very heavy, try it!
Come on! Come on!
Rachel| (Disgustedly she goes and tries to pick up the couch. Much to her
amazement, she is successful.) Oh. Oh! I can do it!
Ross| Yeah!
The Salesman| You two are really gonna enjoy that couch.
Ross| Oh yeah, we're uh, yeah we're not together. (He starts backing out of the
store.)
The Salesman| Ohh, okay. (Laughs.) Something didn't quite add up there. (Ross
stops, walks back to talk to the salesman, and in the process pushes Rachel up against a
wall.)
Rachel| Ross!
Ross| What's that supposed to mean?
Rachel| Ross!
The Salesman| Well you, her, I mean, she's veryy'know. And you're
likey'know.
Ross| Not that it's any of your business, but we did go out.
The Salesman| Really? You two?
Ross| Yeah! Rach?
Rachel| Come on, I don't really want to be doing this right now. I am carrying a
very heavy couch.
Ross| Then tell him quickly.
Rachel| (To Ross) Fine! (To the salesman) We went out.
Ross| Not only did we go out, we did it 298 times!
Rachel| Ross!! Oh my--ugh!! You kept count?! You are such a loser!
Ross| A loser you did it with (To the salesman) 298 times!
[Scene| Outside of Central Perk, Phoebe is exiting and sees a woman put out her
cigarette on a tree.]
Phoebe| Oh. Oh! Ma'am? Excuse me, ma'am?
The Smoking Woman| Yes?
Phoebe| You can't put your cigarette out on a tree!
The Smoking Woman| Yeah I can, it worked real well.
Phoebe| No but you shouldn't! Don't ever do that again.
The Smoking Woman| I won't! (Turns away) Until I have my next cigarette.
Phoebe| Hold it! (Grabs the badge) N.Y.P.D! Freeze punk!
The Smoking Woman| What?!
Phoebe| Yeah that's right you are so busted. (To no one in particular.) Book
'em.
The Smoking Woman| Who are you talking too?
Phoebe| Save it Red! Unless you wanna spend the night in the slammer, you
apologize to the tree.
The Smoking Woman| I am not going to apologize to a tree!
Phoebe| You apologize to the tree right now or I am calling for backup. (The
woman calls her bluff.) (Screaming at no one in particular) Backup! Backup!!
The Smoking Woman| I-I'm sorry! Sorry.
Phoebe| Okay, cancel backup! Cancel backup!
[Scene| Ross's building's lobby, he and Rachel are about to attempt to take the couch
upstairs.]
Ross| Okay. (Throws off the last cushion.)
Rachel| Ross, didn't you say that there was an elevator in here?
Ross| Uhh, yes I did but there isn't. Okay, here we go.
Ross| Okay, go left. Left! Left! (The bottom of the couch is hitting the
railing.)
Rachel| Okay, y'know what? There is no more left, left!
Ross| Oh okay, lift it straight up over your head! Straight up over your head!
You can do it! You can do it! (She gets it lifted up and they make the first turn.) Okay.
You got it?
Rachel| Yeah.
Ross| Good-good-good.
Rachel| Oh-oh!
Ross| Yeah, you got it right? You got it right? You got it?
Rachel| Any chance you think the couch looks good there?
[Scene| Chandler and Joey's, Phoebe is telling Chandler and Monica how she fought crime
in her own way with the badge she found.]
Phoebe| so this guy was all (Mumbles.) And I'm all, Buffay, Homicide.
(Flashes the badge.) It was just so cool!
Monica| (cooking something) Phoebe, you were supposed to take that back!
Phoebe| I know but I'm having so much fun doing good deeds.
Chandler| Okay, but impersonating a police officer is a serious thing. You could
get arrested.
Phoebe| You could get arrested, right now! (Flashes the badge and they glare at
her.) All right, yeah, I gotta take it back. I'm totally drunk with power. (She heads for
the door just as Joey enters.)
Phoebe| (To Joey) Hey.
Joey| (To Phoebe) Hey! (Sees that Monica's there.) Oh.
Chandler| Hi, Joe.
Joey| Yeah, I didnt know you guys were going to be here.
Monica| Hey Joey, sweetie, taste this. (Holds out a spoon for him.)
Joey| (backing away) What?! Why?!
Monica| What is going on with you?
Joey| Nothing!
Chandler| Oh, come on! You've been acting strange all day!
Joey| All right! There is something. I kinda had a dream, (pause) but I don't
want to talk about it. (Starts for his room.)
Chandler| Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-what-what if Martin Luther King had said
that? (Imitating what his famous speech would sound like.) I kinda have a dream! I
dont want to talk about it.
Joey| Well, it involved Monica.
Chandler| You had a dream about a girl that I am seeing?! Oh, that is so cool!
(To Monica) I can't tell you how many times I've dreamt about a girl that he was seeing.
(Seeing Monica's stare.) (To Joey) Anyway we're talking about your dream. (To Monica) I
love you. (To Joey) Your dream? (Leans in to listen closely.)
Joey| Don't worry, there wasn't any sex in it or anything. I haven't dreamt
about her like that since I found out about you two--ish.
Monica| What was the dream about?
Joey| Well, okay. You were my girlfriend and we were doing the crossword
puzzle. Y'know like you guys were doing last night. So, that's it. I'm in love with Monica
and I'll be moving out.
Monica| Wait, Joey! Joey! That doesnt mean that-that you're in love with
me!
Joey| It-it doesnt?
Monica| No!
Chandler| No, it can mean anything. Like uh, all of the sudden you're jealous
because I've become the apartment stud.
Joey| That kinda sounds like your dream dude.
Monica| Or, it could mean that-that you saw Chandler and me together and we
y'know were being close and stuff and then you just want to have that with someone too.
Joey| In the dream I did enjoy the closeness.
Monica| Um-hmm.
Chandler| Joey, look, are you attracted to Monica? Right here, right now, are
you attracted to her?
Joey| (looks at her) Not really.
Chandler| Well there you have it!
Monica| Well sure! I'm just wearing sweats! (Looking at Chandler and slowly
realizing what his point is.) But that's good that you're not in love with me, because you
just want a girlfriend!
Joey| No, I don't think it's just about just getting a girlfriend. Y'know? I
mean, yeah, I can get a girlfriend! Yeah, we could sit in the chair and do crosswords, but
y'know are we ever going to have y'know the closeness like-like you guys have?
Chandler| Well y'know, Monica and I were friends before we started
dating. So maybe-maybe that's it?
Joey| Friends first? That's interesting.
Monica| You become friends after?
Joey| No, never done that either.
Rachel| (entering) Hey, umm, do you guys have that tape measure?
Chandler| Oh yeah, it's actually in my bedroom.
Monica| (laughing) That's right.
Rachel| (noticing him) What's up Joey?
Joey| (in a sexy voice) How you doin'?
[Scene| Outside Central Perk, Phoebe is walking up and notices a car that is parked
half on the curb and right in front of the door, making it difficult for people to enter
Central Perk.]
Phoebe| Excuse me, is this your car?
Guy| Yeah.
Phoebe| Well I don't think it's very nice of you to park here, y'know you're
blocking the entrance.
Guy| Don't worry about it. It's not a problem.
Phoebe| Well, it's a problem for me, which means it's a problem for you 'cause
I'm a cop. (Shows the badge.)
Guy| (he reaches into the car and slams his siren on the roof.) So am I!
Phoebe| Ohh, no. (Pause) Oh okay, so you're a cop which means you can park
anywhere, 'cause I know that 'cause I'm a cop too. So, all right, keep up the good work.
10-4. (Tries to leave.)
Cop| (stopping her) Hey, wait a second! So wait, what precinct are you with?
Phoebe| I-I'm with the umm, the 57th.
Cop| Oh, I know a guy in homicide up there.
Phoebe| I'm in vice. Yeah, in fact I'm undercover right now. I'm a whore.
Cop| Who-who else is in vice up there?
Phoebe| Umm, do you know, umm Sipowicz?
Cop| Sipowicz? No, I don't think so.
Phoebe| Yeah, big guy, kinda bald.
Cop| No, I don't know him.
Phoebe| (starts to walk away, but stops) Dont try to call him or anything,
'cause he's not there, he's out. His umm, his partner just died.
Cop| Wow umm, tell Sipowicz I'm real sorry for his loss.
Phoebe| I-I sure will, take care. (Starts walking off.)
Cop| (following her) Hey by the way, I'm sure Sipowicz is gonna be all right. I
heard that kid from Silver Spoons is really good. (Phoebe's stunned) And where did
you find my badge?
Phoebe| Oh. (She starts laughing. Then she throws the badge at him and runs
away.)
[Scene| Monica and Rachel's, Joey is entering. Rachel is there getting some tools to
help Ross out.]
Rachel| Hey! Joey, would you mind giving me and Ross a hand moving his couch?
Joey| Oh, I'd love too, but I got acting class. But y'know what? I guess I can
blow that off, (In a sexy voice) for you.
Rachel| Thanks!
Joey| Uh, hey, Rach let me ask you something. Uh, I was just over there talking
to Monica and Chandler, boy they are really tight.
Rachel| I know.
Joey| Yeah that's not such a bad situation they got going over there. I'm
thinking of getting me one of those.
Rachel| What's up Joe?
Joey| Well, the reason I think Monica and Chandler are so great
Rachel| Yeah?
Joey| is because they were friends first. Y'know? So I asked myself,
"Who are my friends?" You and Phoebe, and I saw you first. So
Rachel| (laughing) What are you saying?
Joey| I'm saying maybe you and I crank it up a notch.
Rachel| Y'know honey, umm, as uh, as flattered as I am that uh, you saw me
first, uhh, I just, I-I don't think we should be cranking anything up.
Joey| I'll treat you real nice. (Pulls out a chair for her.)
Rachel| (laughs and pushes the chair back in) Yeah, well, y'know umm No
honey, listen I think it's a great idea to become friends with someone before you
date them, but I think the way you do it is y'know you meet someone, become their friend,
build a foundation, then you ask them out on a date. Don't hit on your existing friends!
Joey| Won't-won't that take longer?
Rachel| Yeah. Yeah. Oh, but once you find it, ohh it's so worth the wait.
Joey| Yeah. I understand. I understand. (Pause) Man, I wish I saw Phoebe
first!
[Scene| The lobby of Ross's building, he's sitting on the couch at the bottom of the
stairs, and he's practicing enticing women to join him on the couch.]
Ross| Come here to me. No-no, you come here to me.
Rachel| (entering) Hey Ross! I brought reinforcements.
Ross| Oh great! What, you brought Joey?
Rachel| Well, I brought the next best thing.
Chandler| (entering) Hey!
Ross| Chandler?! You brought Chandler?! The next best thing would be Monica!
Chandler| Y'know, I would be offended, but Monica is freakishly strong, so
Ross| Look, I-I drew a sketch about how we're gonna do it. (Showing them) Okay
Rach, (points to the sketch) that's you. That's the couch. (Points again.)
Rachel| Whoa-oh, what's-what's that? (Points.)
Ross| Oh, that's me.
Rachel| Wow! You certainly think a lot of yourself.
Ross| No! That's-that's my arm!
Chandler| (looking at the sketch) Oh, I see. I thought you just really, really
liked your new couch.
Ross| Y'know what? Just-just follow my lead.
Rachel| Okay!
Chandler| Okay.
Ross| Come on, Chandler.
Ross| All right. (They start up the stairs. Ross is first.) Okay, here we go!
Ross| All right, ready?
Chandler| Yeah.
Ross| Turn.
Chandler| (straining) Okay.
Ross| Turn! Turn!
Chandler| Okay, I don't think we can turn anymore!
Rachel| Ross, I don't, I just don't think it's going to fit.
Ross| Oh yeah it will! Come on, up! Up-up-up! Up! Yes! Here we go! Pivot! (They
start up the stairs again. Chandler is between the couch and the wall now.) Pivot! Piv-ot!
Piv-et!! Piv-ett!!! Piv-et!
Chandler| Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!!
Ross| Okay, I don't think it's going to pivot anymore.
Chandler and Rachel|
Ross| All right, let's uh, let's bring it back down and-and try again.
Chandler| Okay, yeah, I think it's really stuck now.
Ross| I can't believe that didn't work!
Rachel| I know, me neither! I mean, you had a sketch!
Chandler| Oh, y'know, what did you mean when you said pivot?
[Scene| Chandler and Joey's, Joey is returning and finds Chandler, Monica, and Rachel
are there.]
Joey| (entering) Hey!
Rachel| Hey! How's it going? Did you make any new friends?
Joey| Yeah, yeah, I met this woman. (Starts for his room.)
Chandler| (stopping him) Hey, whoa-whoa! What's she like?
Joey| Uhh, well, she'sreally good in bed.
Monica| Joey, I thought you were gonna try to be friends first!
Joey| (To Rachel) Well look, hey, it's all your fault!
Rachel| What?! Why?!
Joey| Well because you didn't give me advice! No! You gave me a pickup line! As
soon as I told her I wanted to y'know, build a foundation and be friends first. I
suddenly, through no fault of my own, became irresistible to her! (Pause) And her
roommate!
Monica| What about the closeness?
Joey| Closeness-shmoshness! There was three of us for crying out loud!
[Scene| Monica and Rachel's, Joey is entering with a pizza and finds everyone but Ross
there.]
Joey| (entering) All right! Hey, who wants pizza?!
Chandler| Ooh, I do! I do! I do!
Joey| (taking a bite) Oh, great! Can you believe I found it on the second floor?
Monica| Who is it?
Voice|
Phoebe and Joey|
Joey| Uhh, just a minute officer!!
Cop|
Phoebe| Ooh, God, it's him! It's that cop! God, I can't believe it! He found me!
Rachel| Oh my God, Phoebe, are you gonna go to jail?!
Phoebe| Well, if I'm going down, I'm taking you (Points at all of them) with me.
(They all look at her.) Harboring a fugitive? That's one to three years minimum. Good luck
Chandler. (She opens the door to the cop from before.) Okay, you can arrest me. Fine. But
you'll never make it stick and you know it!
Cop| Yeah, but I kinda don't have a choice, it's my job. I mean, you understand
right?
Phoebe| Yep! As long as you understand that I'm going to call my lawyer and once
he puts you on the stand he'll make you look like a fool. A fool!
Cop| I don't like looking foolish. Y'know what? Maybe uh, I don't arrest you
today. Maybe I came by and you weren't here.
Phoebe| I would love it if I weren't here!
Cop| Okay, so since umm, you're not going to jail tonight I was wondering if you
would like to go to dinner with me?
Phoebe| Me?!
Cop| Yeah. Ever since you flashed my badge at me, I kinda can't stop thinking
about you. You're the prettiest, fake undercover whore I've ever seen.
Chandler and Joey|
Phoebe| Wow! I didn't see that coming! You're-you're asking me out!
Cop| Yeah. I mean, I coulda done it better, but these people keep staring at me.
Phoebe| Umm, yeah, I'd like to go out with you officer
Cop| Gary.
Phoebe| Gary.
Gary| Okay, so it's a date.
Phoebe| Yeah! So--ooh, I gotta ask you though. How did you know where to find
me?
Gary| Well you're fingerprints were all over my badge so I just ran it through
the computer and this was listed as your last known address so I just checked it out.
Phoebe| Ohh, impressive.
Gary| Not as impressive as you. I gotta tell you, I looked at your record and
you've done some pretty weird stuff.
Phoebe| Yeah, we'll talk at dinner.
Gary| Okay. (He starts to leave.) So I'll come by in a couple hours and pick you
up?
Phoebe| All right, I can't wait!
Gary| Okay. And don't worry, I'm not just gonna take you out for donuts.
Chandler| (To Rachel) He has a gun!
[Scene| The couch store, Ross is talking to a saleswoman.]
Ross| I'd like to return this couch. I'm not satisfied with it.
The Saleswoman| You wanna return this couch? (Ross nods yes.) It's cut in half!
Ross| That's what I'm telling you.
The Saleswoman| Did you cut this couch in half?
Ross| This couch, is cut in half! I would like to exchange it for one
that is not cut in half!
The Saleswoman| You're telling me this couch was delivered to you like this?!
Ross| Look, I am a reasonable man. I will accept store credit.
The Saleswoman| I'll give you store credit in the amount of four dollars.
Ross| (thinks) I take it.
[Scene| Central Perk, everyone is there as Rachel enters, happily.]
Rachel| Good, you guys are all here!
Ross| Hey! What's up?
Rachel| Well, I have a job interview at Ralph Lauren tomorrow!
All| Congratulations! Ohh, that's great!
Rachel| I know!
Joey| Boy, that guy's underwear sucks!
Rachel| Wh-what?!
Joey| I got this pair marked excess, I gotta tell ya, there was no room for
excess anything in there.
Rachel| Anyway, I'm going to be the coordinator of the woman's collection, I'll
work right under the director, it's the perfect, perfect job for me!
Phoebe| Wow! Well, if you nail the interview, you'll get it!
Rachel| Yeah.
Phoebe| You wanna work on your interview skills?
Rachel| O-okay!
Phoebe| Okay! All right, let's start with the handshake. Hi.
Rachel| Hi.
Phoebe| Very good handshake, good wrist action.
Monica| Let me try. (Gets up to join them.)
Phoebe| Okay. (They shake hands and she pulls away suddenly) Oh my God! What did
I ever do to you?! (Rubbing her hand.)
Monica| Did I squeeze it too hard?
Phoebe| Let's just say, I'm glad I'm not Chandler.
[Scene| Monica and Rachel's, Joey is standing at the window waving at Ross.]
Joey| That's right Ross, I can see you in your new apartment! And you can see
me! Same as yesterday, (To Monica) same as the day before.
Monica| Is he doing his shark attack bit yet?
Joey| Nope. Op, wait! There he goes.
Joey| (waving) Very funny Ross! Very life-like and funny. Okay. (Notices that a
woman is waving back.) Oh no-no-no, I wasn't waving at you lady. (She just stares at him.)
(Joey sees how beautiful she is.) Whoa, maybe I was! Hey, Monica, this totally hot girl in
Ross's building is flirting with me.
Monica| Get in there man! Flirt back, mix it up!
Joey| Yeah, I-I-I'm down with that. (He turns back to the woman.) Okay, here
goes. (Thinks.) How (Holds up his hand like an Indian) you (Points at her) a-doin'? (Does
a little twisting motion with both hands and ends up pointing at her, he then winks. She
smiles and waves again.) (To Monica) It worked! She's waving me over. (Towards the woman.)
Okay, I-I-I'll be right over. Let's see, she's on the third floor
Monica| (joining him) Wow! She is pretty, huh?
Joey| Tell me about it, huh? (Realizes that she can see Monica.) Oh no-no-no,
I'm not with her, she's just Monica! (He pantomimes that out.) Ewwuck! (He pushes Monica
away and makes a disgusted face.)
[Scene| Ross's Building, Joey is trying to find the hot girl's apartment. So he's
walking up the hallway counting doors. He comes to what he thinks is the right one and
knocks on it. Ross opens the door, it's his apartment.]
Ross| Hey Joey! Great stuff huh?
Joey| This is your place?
Ross| Of course it is. Yeah, come on in. Ooh-ooh, go by the window you can
pretend to be surfing. (He pretends he's surfing by the window.)
Joey| But I counted, you're not supposed to live here! Oh man! (Runs away.)
[Scene| Monica and Rachel's, Joey is entering again.]
Joey| Ugh!!
Monica| What happened?
Joey| I ended up at Ross's place. Oh, I musta missed counted or something.
(Looks out the window.) Damn! She's not there anymore. Oh, l-l-look, Ross is doing his
'Watching TV' bit. (We see Ross sitting on the couch and flipping through the channels on
his remote.)
Monica| No Joey, I think he's just watchin' TV.
[Scene| Monica and Rachel's, later that day, Gary is kissing Phoebe good-bye.]
Gary's Radio| We've lost visual contact with the suspect.
Gary| Okay, now I've really have to go!
Phoebe| But it's just so unfair that our date has to get cut short just 'cause
some guy shot at a store clerk.
Gary| I know, but it's my job, sweethart!
Phoebe| Okay, then maybe I can come too!
Gary's Radio| Suspect has just emerged naked from the sewer.
Phoebe| All right, you go. (They kiss.)
Gary| Bye-bye.
Phoebe| 'Kay, bye!
Phoebe| Oh God!
Monica| What?
Phoebe| Oh I just miss him so much!
Monica| Wow! For just a week you guys are really close, huh?
Phoebe| Yeah, it's weird. I can't help it though he's so sweet, he's like this
little puppy dog, y'know? But like a really tough one that shots bad guys. Ohh, I just love
beginning parts of relationships, y'know?! You just like can't keep your hands off each
other.
Monica| I know it is the best.
Phoebe| So-so how long did that last for you and Chandler?
Monica| What? It's still going on.
Phoebe| Come on, seriously! When did it end?
Monica| I-I am serious, I mean, we're, we're all over each other all the time.
Phoebe| Okay, you know where you are better than I do. I was just curious.
Monica| (Start annoying hyper-competitive mode now.) (Jumping up) What don't you
just calm down Phoebe! All right?! Why dont you just get all your facts before you
run around telling everybody that you're the only hot couple!!
Phoebe| (Under her breath) God, I woke the beast. Sorry. (To Monica) I was wrong
obviously, I justI misspoke. It's okay.
Monica| Oh no, it is okay, I mean as long as you know that Chandler and I
are also very hot and fiery, just as hot as you! I mean our flame, whew, is on fire!
Chandler| (entering) Hey Monica, here's your broom back.
Monica| You are so cute. (She goes over and kisses him passionately.)
[Scene| Monica and Rachel's, the next day, Chandler and Joey are there as Rachel
returns from her interview.]
Chandler| Oh hey, how'd the interview go?
Rachel| Ugh, horrible! I did the stupidest, most embarrassing thing!
Joey| Did you tell the guy you wanted to have sex with his wife and then fall
right out of your chair?
Rachel| No!
Chandler| So what happened?
Rachel| Ugh, it was horrible! And-and the interview part went so well, y'know? I
even made him laugh. He said something about a boat and I was like, "Well, yeah! If
you've got enough life jackets!" (She starts laughing; Chandler and Joey are not
amused.) Trust me, it was actually, it was very funny. Anyway, so we were saying good-bye
and ugh!
Joey| What happened?
Rachel| (We see a flashback as Rachel describes what happened.) All right, we
were shaking hands and he kinda leaned toward me Y'know maybe he was going to open
the door, but I totally miss read him and I uhhh (The flashback shows that she
kissed him on the cheek.)
Joey| You kissed him?!
Rachel| Well, I didn't know what else to do!
Chandler| Well you coulda tried, not kissing him.
Rachel| Thanks Chandler.
Monica| (entering from the bathroom) Hey Rach, a guy from Ralph Lauren
called, you got a second interview!
Rachel| I can't believe it! I got a second interview!
Monica| Yes!
Joey| I bet that kiss isn't looking like such a big mistake now, is it?
Rachel| What-what, wait a minute, you don't think that's why he wants me back?
Joey| Yeah! (Chandler makes a noise) No?
Monica| A kiss? What are you talking about?
Rachel| I accidentally kissed him in the interview, and now he wants me back
y'know of course, 'cause "Let's bring the girl back who kisses everybody!"
Chandler| Come on, Rach.
Rachel| Oh my God! What if he thinks I'm the kind of girl that-that would just
sleep with him?
Monica| He probably wants you back because you're right for the job.
Rachel| Maybe. I-I don't knowOh God, how could I be so stupid?!
Joey| Oh Rachel look, don't say that, I think you just need a hug from Joey.
Come on. Come on. (She hugs him and Joey looks out the window.) She's back! Hot girl's
back!
Rachel| Ohh, well I'm not totally back yet, but thank you.
Joey| No, in Ross's building! (He throws Rachel onto the chair and heads to the
window.) She's back! She's back! (Pantomimes) Okay, wait there, I'll be over in a second.
(He counts where she is again.) Got it! (Runs out and does a little hot over a chair.)
Chandler| I gotta check out this hot girl! (He heads to the window but realizes
something, stops, turns and points at Monica.) There she is! (He dances over to her and
kisses her.)
[Scene| Ross's building, Joey is knocking on a door again. It's again answered by
Ross.]
Joey| Damnit!! Did you move?!
Ross| Yes. I lived with you guys for a while and then I found this place. (Joey
just stares at him) I'm Ross.
The Old Man| Yes?
Joey| (Looking around) Uhh do you happen to have a hot girl in there?
The Old Man| No. I'm all alone.
Joey| Yeah. Sorry about that. (He walks away and knocks on the next door which
is answered by a little girl.) Oh, hey little girl. Uhh, is-is your mommy, or sister, or
babysitter by any chance a hot girl?
The Little Girl| Daddy!!
Joey| Later! (He runs away down the hall and hides behind a corner to a whole
other corridor.) Oh man! (Walks down the hallway in desperation.) Hot girl! Hot girl!!
[Scene| Rachel's job interview, she is waiting outside Mr. Zelner's (the interviewer)
office banging her pen between her teeth.]
Mr. Zelner| Hi Rachel!
Rachel| Hi!
Mr. Zelner| Come on in.
Mr. Zelner| It's really nice to see you again.
Rachel| Thank you.
Mr. Zelner| (Sees that she has some ink on her lip from her pen.) Oh Rachel,
uhh (He points to his lip to get her to notice the ink on hers.)
Rachel| What?
Mr. Zelner| Just ah (He points again.)
Rachel| Excuse me?
Mr. Zelner| Here let me (He goes to wipe it off himself.)
Rachel| (stopping him) Wh-whoa! All right, okay-okay, I see, I see what's going
on here! Now listen, look-look, I'm sorry if I gave you the wrong impression, but I am not
some hussy who will just sleep around to get ahead! Now even though I (He tries to
interrupt and tell her about the ink), hey-hey-hey, even though I kissed you, that does
not give you the right to demand sex from me. I do not want, this job that
bad. Good day, sir. (She storms out of his office.)
[Scene| Monica and Rachel's, Rachel is returning from her interview attempt.]
Rachel| (entering) Ugh, you will not believe what that sleaze-ball from Ralph
Lauren did too me!
Rachel| Okay-okay that-that's amazing. How did you know that?
Ross| You got ink on your lip.
Rachel| Oh. (Realizes.) Ohhhhhhhhh.
[Scene| Central Perk, Phoebe and Gary and Chandler and Monica are all there.]
Chandler| (To Gary) So what do you say, maybe sometime I hold your gun?
Gary| I don't know man, we're really not supposed to do that.
Chandler| Oh, what can happen? I mean, would you (He gestures and spills
some of his coffee.)
Gary| Yeah, I'm gonna say no.
Monica| Phoebe, do you want to go see a movie after dinner tonight?
Phoebe| Oh we can't, we already have plans.
Monica| What are you doing?
Phoebe| Well, same thing we did all day, hang out at Gary's apartment. He is so
amazing, we never left the bedroom. But have fun at the movie.
Monica| (That annoying competitiveness thing kicks in again, what the heck is
that with her and why must the writers show it every flippin' episode?!) Oh, we're not
seeing a movie!
Phoebe| You're not? Then why did you ask us if we wanted to go?
Monica| Oh umm, that's because I just wanted to y'know walk in on me and
Chandler while we were, y'know, doing it all night. Will you excuse me for just a second?
Phoebe| Yeah!
Monica| Okay. (She gets up and walks over to Chandler.) Chandler? Can I see you
for a second?
Chandler| Uh, yeah.
Monica| Okay. (They walk away to get some privacy.) We have got to beat
them! {Here we go yet again.}
Chandler| Why?
Monica| 'Cause, Gary and Phoebe think they're a hotter couple than we are!
Chandler| Ohh, so?
Monica| So! So we've got to go upstairs and have a lot of sex to prove them
wrong!
Chandler| Monica, you have got to stop this competitive thing! Okay? It's
crazy. {Finally! The voice of reason.} I mean, just impress Gary and Phoebe we have to go
upstairs and have sex over and over and I'm saying no to this, why? Get your coat.
[Scene| The lobby in Ross's building, we see a flyer that is on the bulletin board that
reads, "Are you the Hot Girl who waved at me? If so, give me a call!" and it's
signed, Joey 629-9*** (The last couple of numbers have been ripped off). Anyhoo, Ross is
getting his mail.]
Ross| (to the woman checking her mail next to him) Hey!
The Man| (To Ross) Excuse me. (He puts up a flyer that has a sketch drawing of
Joey and it reads, "Warning! Intruder! If you see this creep - call the cops!")
You should check this out, tell the other tenants. Apparently he's running around looking
for some kind of a hot girl.
Ross| (to the woman checking her mail) Who isn't?
Ross| I don't, I don't think we've meet. I-I'm Ross.
The Hot Girl| I know. You're the guy who wouldn't chip in for the handyman.
Ross| Nevermind! (Goes back to his mailbox.)
The Hot Girl| No, I-I actually thought it was unfair the way everyone reacted. I
mean you had just moved in.
Ross| I had just moved in. Thank you! Listen umm
The Hot Girl| Jen.
Ross| Jen, I know this may sound a little(makes some kind of crazy noise)
But uh, would you maybe wanna grab a cup of coffee sometime, or
Jen| Sure! That would be nice.
Ross| Umm?
Jen| Oh! My number is on there. (Hands him a business card.) Give me a call.
Ross| I will give you a call.
Jen| I'll see you later. (Starts to walk away.)
Ross| Okay!
Jen| I forgot my paper. (Ross quickly hides the card in his mouth.)
[Scene| Monica and Rachel's, a post-coital Monica and Chandler are recovering on the
couch.]
Chandler| That was amazing!
Monica| Phoebe and Gary are so gonna hear about this at dinner.
Chandler| That was amazing.
Monica| We are the hottest! Huh? No one is hotter than we are! You're the
best.
Chandler| No, you're the best.
Monica| No, you're the best.
Chandler| No, you're the best.
Monica| I am the best.
Joey| (entering) Hey guys! (Sees their state of undress) What 'cha been doin'?
(Has a silly grin.)
Monica| (looking out the window) Hey Joey! Isn't that the girl that waved at you
the other day?
Joey| I don't know. But I can see through your sheet. (He looks out the window.)
Yeah, yeah, that's her. But y'know what? Doesn't matter, I'm never gonna get to meet her
anyway.
Monica| Why?
Joey| Because it's impossible to find her apartment! She lives in some like of
hot girl parallel universe, or something.
Monica| What are you talking about? (Pointing out the window.) She obviously
lives on the second floor, seventh apartment from the left!
Joey| No. No. No. She lives on the third floor, eighth apartment
from the left.
Monica| No, those first two windows, (Points) that's the lobby. And y'know the
other one over there, that's the stairway. You've been counting wrong.
Joey| I did not know that! Thank you Monica. (Starts to leave) I can't
believe I almost lost another girl because of counting.
[Scene| Jen's apartment, Ross is picking her up for their date.]
Ross| So uhh, you ready?
Jen| Sure, I'll just get my coat. (There's a knock on the door.) Could you get
that?
Ross| Sure. (He opens the door to Joey. Needless to say, Joey's stunned.)
Joey
Joey| Dahhhhh!! (Ross has a puzzled look on his face.) No! Noooo!! (Storms off.)
[Scene| Mr. Zelner's office, Rachel has come back again to try and do that second
interview.]
Rachel| Ah, first, I-I would like to say thank you for agreeing to see me again.
Mr. Zelner| That's quite all right, but I feel obligated to tell you that this
meeting is being videotaped.
Rachel| (looks around for the camera) Okay. Umm, well, first I would like to
start by apologizing for kissing you and uh, for yelling at you.
Mr. Zelner| Fair enough.
Rachel| Now you're probably going to hire one of the people who did not ah, (She
puts her hands on his desk blotter and he moves it. Rachel then doesn't know where to put
her hands.) who did, who did not umm, yell at you and storm out, and I think that's a big
mistake and here's why. I made a huge fool of myself and I came back, that shows courage.
When I thought you wanted sex in exchange for this job, I said no. That shows integrity.
And, I was not afraid to stand up for myself and that shows courage. (Suddenly realizes
that she said courage twice.) Okay umm, now I know I already said courage, but y'know you
gotta have courage. And umm, and finally when I thought you were making sexual advances in
the workplace, I said no and I was not litigious. {By the way, litigious means to want to
litigate and litigate is to make a lawsuit against.  So she didn't want to sue him.
  Don't worry, I had to look it up too.} So there you go, you got, you got (counts
them off with her fingers) courage, you got integrity, you got (Pause) courage again, and
not litigious. Look Mr
Mr. Zelner| Zelner.
Rachel| Zelner! Right! I knew that! I really, really want this job and I think,
I think I would be really good at it.
Mr. Zelner| Y'know what? I may regret this but uh, I'm going to give you a shot.
Rachel| (gasps) Oh! You are?
Mr. Zelner| Um-hmm.
Rachel| Really? Oh thank you! Oh Oh, would it be completely inappropriate
to give you a hug?
Mr. Zelner| Yes!
Rachel| Okay, well then how about a handshake? (She goes to shake his hand but
misses and touches his groin.) Oh God I'm sorry! Oh God, I'm sorry! I did not mean to
touch thatI mean you there. There. Uhh, okay, so thank-thank you, I'm going
to leave now thank you very much uh-huh, thank you soHey! I'll see you Monday!
(Exits.)
[Scene| A restaurant, Chandler, Monica, Phoebe, and Gary are on a double date. Chandler
is yawning.]
Phoebe| You tired Chandler?
Monica| You better believe he's tired, after the day we had! If you know what I
mean. You know what I mean?
Chandler| Honey, the tortilla chips know what you mean.
Gary| So uh Chandler, you like that badge I got you?
Chandler| Oh yeah, it's so cool. (He opens his coat and has it pinned to the
lining.) Now I gotta go, Officer Bing has gotta, 10-100. (Pause, softly) That's pee-pee.
(Heads for the bathroom.)
Monica| Phoebe, you have a, a twig in your hair.
Phoebe| Ohh, (laughs) umm, we kinda took a little detour on the way over here.
Gary| Yeah, we took a little stroll in the park and no one was around, so
Monica| You didn't!
Phoebe| We did! We violated Section 12 Paragraph 7 of the criminal code!
Monica| The park huh? A public place.
Gary| Uh-huh.
Monica| I hear ya. Excuse me for just a second! (Gets up and heads for the
bathroom as that annoying Gotta-win-at-all-costs-super-competitive thing kicks in again.)
Monica| Hi Chandler.
Chandler| Monica! This is the Men's room! (Pause) Isn't it?
Monica| Yes it is. You see I've always found the men's bathroom very sexual.
Haven't you?
Chandler| No. And if I did, I don't think we'd be going out. Monica, this is
getting ridiculous!
Monica| Come on, we can't let them win!
Chandler| Ugh, we have already proved that we are hot! Okay? So why-why are you
getting so obsessed about this thing?!
Monica| Because Phoebe and Gary are in
that-can't-keep-their-hands-off-each-other-doing-it-in-the-park phase!
Chandler| (gasps) So?
Monica| I feel really sad that we're notreally there anymore.
Chandler| Oh wow! Is that what this all have been about?
Monica| Wasn't it a lot more exciting when we were y'know all over each other
all the time?
Chandler| Yeah that was great. That was really great! But to tell you the truth,
I'm more excited about where we are right now.
Monica| Really?
Chandler| Yeah! I've never been in a relationship that's lasted this long
before. Y'know to get past the beginning and still be around each other all the time, I
think that's pretty incredible. And the fact that this is happening all with you, yeah I
think that's pretty exciting. (Kisses her.)
Monica| That is so sweet. I know that I was acting a little crazy but umm, I
feel the same way.
Chandler| Yeah?
Monica| Yeah. (They hug.)
Chandler| Y'know what I just realized? You just freaked out about our
relationship.
Monica| Did not.
Chandler| Yes you did! Admit it! You freaked out!
Monica| Okay, I freaked out a little.
Chandler| Little?! You freaked out big time! Okay? And I fixed it! We have
switched places! I am the relationship and king and you are the crazy, irrational
screw up! (Does a dance of joy.) (Monica glares at him.) And now we're back.
[Scene| Looking through Ross's window, he's doing more pantomimes. The first one is
he's walking a dog that has stopped, then suddenly tugs him forward.]
Rachel| (laughs) I cannot believe Ross is buying this!
Monica| Thank God! I can't watch him anymore!
Chandler| (entering) You guys ready fore the movies?
Rachel| Yeah! Oh by the way, thank you for loaning us Pamela and Yasmine.
Ross| (from his apartment) Man! They cannot get enough! (Makes like he's a robot
and waves at the cutouts.)
[Scene| Central Perk, Joey, Chandler, Monica, and Phoebe are there. Joey is holding a
deck of cards out to Chandler.]
Joey| Okay, pick a card.
Chandler| Okay. (He picks the 9 of Spades)
Joey| All right now, memorize it. (Pause) You got it?
Chandler| Oh yes.
Joey| (holding up the Queen of Clubs) Is that your card? (He winks and smiles.)
Chandler| (pause) Yes.
Carol| (entering with Ben and Ross) Hey guys!
Ross| Hi!
Chandler| Hi there!
Ben| Hi!!
Carol| Guess what? Ben is going to be in a TV commercial!
Phoebe| What are you talking about?!
Ross| (sets Ben down) Well, it's not for sure but umm, we met this guy in the
park who thought Ben was really cute--y'know, which he is--so umm anyhoo, he uh, he gave
us his card and told us to bring him down for this commercial he's auditioning.
Joey| (reading the card) Whoa! This guy is like the biggest commercial casting
director in town! (Ross gasps) Ben takes one lousy walk in the park and gets an audition!!
(Ross and Carol stare at him, then Joey realizes what he just said.) I mean, way to go
Ben! (Gives Ben the thumbs up, which Ben returns.) Man! I've been in that park a million
times and no one offered me an audition.
Ross| I know, it's crazy! We were just pushing Ben on the swings
Joey| I'm always on the swings! What am I doing wrong?!
Chandler| That.
[Scene| Monica and Rachel's, everyone is eating breakfast, Ross is heading for the
bathroom.]
Rachel| (entering from her room) Okay, gotta go! Wish me luck!
Joey| Luck!
Chandler| Hey Rach, now that you're working at Ralph Lauren, can you
bring me back some of those polo shirts?
Rachel| Uh well, y'know what? I don't think if I feel comfortable stealing on my
very first day
Chandler| Unwilling to steal from work, interesting.
Monica| Besides, if anybody's gonna get free stuff, it's gonna be me.
Rachel| Okay guys, way to wish me luck!
All| Good luck! Go get 'em! (Rachel exits.)
Phoebe| Okay, let's discuss Rachel's birthday. I say we throw a surprise party
this weekend.
Joey| Whoa-whoa, but her birthday isn't like for another month.
Phoebe| Yeah but if we throw her a party on her birthday, then it's not a
surprise.
Monica| I think it's a great idea. Yeah, we could have a dinner party and just
invite her close friends.
Joey| Ross!! We're having a surprise party for Rachel!!
Ross| (from the bathroom) Okay!!
Joey| Done.
Phoebe| Okay, great so do you want to do it together?
Monica| I would love to do it together!
Joey| They're gonna do it together.
Chandler| Dude! That's my girlfriend!
Joey| What, so I gotta shut it down now?
Ross| All right, I gotta take off. I'm picking up Ben then we're off to the big
audition.
Monica| It's gonna be weird to watch some actor pretending to be Ben's dad.
Ross| Yeah.
Chandler| Weirder than watching his two moms make out? (Monica nods in
agreement.)
Joey| Whoa-whoa dad? There's a dad in the commercial?
Ross| Yeah the dad and Ben eat soup and pretend to enjoy it.
Joey| Whoa, hey, maybe I'll go down there with ya and see if I can get an
audition to play the dad. I mean who better to play Ben's father than his godfather.
Ross| You're not his godfather.
Joey| What?! Are you kidding?!
Ross| (Pause) Of course I am! (Joey is relieved) Okay, let's go godfather.
Joey| All right!
[Scene| Ben's audition, Carol, Ross, and Ben along with about 10 more families are in a
waiting room as Joey enters happily.]
Joey| Hey! I'm in, they're gonna let me audition!
Ross| Really? That's great!
Joey| I know! I know! It turns out that one of the casting ladies has actually
seen me in a play, so I steered clear of her
Carol| (noticing a kid who has picked up a copy of Variety to read) Hey,
that kid looks familiar.
Joey| Oh yeah, yeah! He's done tons of commercials. I've seen him in like Sugar
Smacks, Playstation, and that one for the phone company. In fact he was so good in
that one, he actually convinced me to switch phone companies. Chandler was mad.
Ross| Yeah well, he's not gonna get this one. Ben is way cuter than that kid. I
mean look at him, look at you, (Starts to whine like a baby and Joey just glares at him.)
Joey| That's great. Listen, wouldn't it be great though if I got to play Ben's
dad?
Ross| Joey, you look nothing like Ben.
Joey| I look more like him than you do! (He winks at Carol.)
Carol| Y'know, I don't really know you well enough for you to do that.
[Scene| Rachel's new job, she's in her new boss's office (Kim's) and with the other
assistant (Nancy). Together they're deciding what clothes to buy or something, who knows,
let's all watch/read to find out.]
Kim| So it's down to these two, Nancy I know you like this one and I think I
agree. Rachel, what do you think?
Rachel| Well umm, that one is pretty but uh, I just, I just love this fabric (On
the other one.) Sorry.
Kim| Oh don't be sorry, that's part of your job here to give your opinions and
then I take credit for them--I'm kidding.
Nancy| She is kidding, but don't ever disagree with her again. Okay, now I'm
kidding!
Rachel| (laughing nervously) Oh, what a fun office.
Kim| I don't know which one, but I do know I need a cigarette. So what do you
say we take a break, we go outside, and we'll figure this out when we come back?
Kim| (at the door) Rachel? Do you smoke?
Rachel| Oh no, my dad's a doctor and he would always tell me just horror
stories(stops and tries to change directions)about ghosts and goblins who
totally supported the princess's right to smoke.
[Scene| Monica and Rachel's, Rachel is telling Chandler and Monica about her day.]
Rachel| and then they came back from smoking and they had made all of the
decisions without me!
Monica| That doesn't seem fair.
Rachel| I know! It's like I'm being punished for not having this disgusting,
poisoning habit!
Chandler| Yeah, it is the best.
Rachel| I mean what if this keeps happening? Y'know, they'll-they'll be outside
smoking, making all the decisions and I'll just be up in my office breathing my stupid
clean air, y'know? And then when the day comes when Kim wants to promote one of us, who do
you think she's gonna pick? Me or Smokey Smokerson?
Monica| Rachel, you can go down there, you don't have to smoke. Just say you
wanna get some fresh air.
Rachel| Yeah, I can do that.
Chandler| Yeah, or you can do the easy thing and smoke.
Phoebe| (entering) Hey!
Monica| Hey!
Phoebe| Hey Rach, you wanna get some coffee?
Rachel| I would love to!
Phoebe| Oh good!
Chandler| Yeah, I wanna go to babe.
Phoebe| Oh good.
Phoebe| Oh wait, I change my mind! (She slams the door on them.) Okay, let's
talk about the party! I have so many ideas! (Holds up a cocktail napkin.)
Monica| Yeah, me too! (Runs and grabs her 3-ring binder of ideas.)
Phoebe| Oh, look at that.
Monica| All right, that's a little sketch of the cake, umm some sample menus,
umm y'know what I thought we would start out with Tuscan style finger food, and for music,
here's an alphabetized list of all my CDs! I've highlighted the ones that would go really
good with the food.
Phoebe| What happened to the intimate dinner party?
Monica| Oh, we're not doing that. Okay
Phoebe| So wow, it looks like you took care of everything. Thanks a lot,
co-host.
Monica| What?! I didn't take care of everything, there's-there's plenty of
things for you to do!
Phoebe| Like what?
Monica| (Thinks) Cups.
Phoebe| Cups? You're giving me cups?
Monica| And ice!
Phoebe| Cups and ice? Ooh, I get to be in charge of cups and ice? (Thinks of
something) All right. Fine, okay, I will be in charge of cups and ice!
Monica| Wait a minute, I can get ice at the restaurant
Phoebe| I got it! Mine!
Ross| (entering, downtrodden) Hi.
Monica| Hey! How'd the audition go?!
Ross| Not so good.
Monica| Wait a minute, are you doing Joey's (sadly) "Audition didn't go so
well. (Happily) Yeah it did?"
Ross| (Pause) Yeah I am! Yeah, Ben got a second audition!
Joey| (also downtrodden) Yeah, I had to teach Ross my bit because I actually
didn't get a callback.
Monica| You got a callback too didn't you?
Joey| (Happily) Yeah I did!
[Scene| The smoker's balcony, Rachel is out to join Kim and Nancy.]
Kim| Hey Rachel, what are you doing out here?
Rachel| Oh well, it's kinda lonely up there, so I just thought I would come out
here and get some fresh air.
Kim| Nancy and I were talking about the fall collection.
Rachel| Oh great!
Kim| So anyway we really (Someone exhales and Rachel turns and coughs.)
Honey, we're just smoking all over you.
Nancy| Oh, sorry!
Rachel| Oh that's okay.
Kim| No-no-no, we'll move you just stay right there. (They walk away.)
Nancy| So anyway I sent the designs over to Ralph and he's very excited about
the line.
Kim| Oh that's great! You are the best!
Rachel| Excuse me, can I, can I bum one of those? (He holds up his pack.) Y'know
what, actually (She takes the one he's smoking and heads over to where Nancy and Kim
are standing and laughing.) Okay, okay, okay, what's so funny over here?
Nancy| I thought you didn't smoke.
Rachel| Oh, I thought you guys meant marijuana cigarettes, y'know? Y'know what I
mean, like dubbies? And I actually, I thought to myself, "Wow, those guys are
crazy!" But no, I actually smoke the regular ones all, all the time.
Kim| We get high.
Rachel| Oh, me too.
Kim| I'm kidding.
Rachel| (Laughs) Oh, me too.
[Scene| Ben and Joey's (Isn't that an ice cream??) callback.]
Ross| Oh God, this is so nerve wracking! How-how do you do this?
Joey| Well, unfortunately, I don't get many callbacks so
Carol| Is it a good sign that they asked us to hang around after the audition?
Joey| Who knows?
The Casting Director| (entering) Okay uh, we have narrowed it down to Raymond,
Ben, Kyle, and Joey. The rest of you, thank you very much.
Ross| Yes!! I knew it!! (To the people who didn't make it.) Bye-bye! So long!
Later!
Joey| Oh this is great! I might actually get to play Ben's dad!
Ross| Yeah!
The Casting Director| Actually, that can't happen. Yeah because you all have
such different looks, we're putting you with Raymond and Kyle with Ben. So it'll be either
you two (Points to Joey and Raymond) or you two. (Points to Kyle and Ben.) (Exits.)
Joey| Man, this is gonna be kinda weird.
Ross| Yeah, it is.
Kyle| Yeah. It's gonna be weird.
Ross| No, we-we're gonna be like best friends, that's why it's gonna be weird.
Kyle| Oh, oh, I thought we were just talking.
[Scene| Chandler and Joey's, Ross and Chandler are talking.]
Phoebe| (entering, carrying two garbage bags) Hey!
Ross and Chandler|
Phoebe| Is it okay if I leave this stuff here 'til Rachel's birthday party?
Chandler| Ah sure. What's in 'em?
Phoebe| Umm, cups.
Chandler| Oh good, because uh we got Rachel 800 gallons of water.
Ross| Seriously that's a lot of cups.
Phoebe| Yeah well, that's 'cause Monica put me in charge of cups and ice, and
Monica is gonna rue the day that she put me in charge of cups and ice.
Chandler| Y'know I rued the day oncedidn't get a whole lot else done.
Phoebe| Okay, time to bring up the rest of the cups. (She goes and opens the
door to Joey.) Oh, hi Joey!
Joey| Hey Pheebs! (To the guys) Hey!
Ross| Hey!
Joey| Ross good, I'm uh glad you're here. I wanna talk to you about something.
Ross| What's up?
Joey| Well, I've been thinking about this whole commercial thing, y'know me
going up against Ben, the two of us competing, and that can't lead to anything good. So, I
think I'm just gonna step aside. I'm gonna tell them that I won't audition.
Ross| Wow, uh, Joey that's-that's great. Thanks man.
Joey| That's it? You're-you're gonna let me do this?! This-this is my career
we're talking about here!
Ross| Well, you just
Joey| I just said that so you wouldn't let Ben do it! Look Ross, if anyone
should step aside it should be Ben!
Ross| What?!
Joey| What? Chandler! Tell 'em!
Chandler| (shocked) Well I mean, let me get the door first. (Goes and opens the
door.) Oh, hi! No one. (Exits.)
Ross| Why should Ben step aside? It was his audition in the first place! You-you
just tagged along! You're like the uh, tag-a-long dad.
Joey| At least I care about his feelings!
Ross| What?!
Joey| Do you know how hard this is gonna be on him when he doesnt get it?
Ross| And why wouldn't he get it?
Joey| Oh, come on! Have you seen what my kid can do?! Huh?! I mean he
dials phones! He-he-he eats tortilla chips! He-he plays soccer with the cartoon tiger!
Ross| Are you saying your kid eats soup better than my kid?
Joey| You just give him a spoon baby!
Ross| Oh yeah? I guess we'll just see!
Joey| Yeah! Because this commercial belongs to me and Mitch!
Ross| You're kid's name is Raymond!
Joey| Yeah?! So's yours!
[Scene| Central Perk, Chandler and Monica are there as Rachel enters.]
Monica| (To Rachel) How did work go?
Rachel| Oh it was great! It was great! I went down there just like you said,
y'know? And we talked business. Kim totally took my opinions.
Monica| You stink!
Rachel| Thanks!
Monica| No, I'm-I'm serious!
Rachel| Well-well that's 'cause I went down there and they were all smoking.
This is actually the smell of success.
Chandler| Okay, there's something different though--Oh my God! You smoked!
Rachel| I did not!
Chandler| Yes you did! You look happy and sick; you smoked!
Rachel| All right, fine! But I had too! I had to do it for my career!
Chandler| I wish I had smoked for my career
Monica| That's so gross!
Rachel| No well, no it's not that bad, y'know? I mean yeah, my tongue feels a
little fuzzy and these fingers sort of smell, I actually feel like I can throw up.
Chandler| Okay, but you gotta push past this because it is about to get so good!
Monica| Chandler! I have to tell you, you smell so smokey I have to get up. I'm
not kidding. (She's not; she stands and walks away. Chandler moves closer.)
Chandler| I think you smell great! (He sniffs her shoulder.)
[Scene| The smoker's balcony, Rachel, Kim, and Nancy are all puffing away on their
cancer sticks.]
Kim| So, we're decided, no on plaid, yes on pink?
Nancy| Absolutely!
Rachel| I am so on board! (She throws away her recently lit cigarette.)
Kim| Rachel didn't you just light that?
Rachel| Yeah, I did, but y'know what? I am really, really trying to cut back,
y'know? (Laughs) Good luck, Rach.
Nancy| I've actually been thinking about quitting lately.
Kim| Oh sure, every Sunday night I'm telling myself I'm quitting but every
Monday morning it's like (Mimics chain smoking.)
Nancy| Tell me about it!
Rachel| Well then let's just quit! We'll just quit! Let's all quit!
Kim| It does sound appealing.
Nancy| Oh, I never could do it.
Rachel| Oh but you could. You can. Absolutely! We can help each other out! We
can get--what are those--those patches! We could be like the Patch Sisters!
Kim| Oh y'know, we really should quit. Okay, let's quit!
Rachel| Yes! Great! Give me those cigs! Give it! Give it! (She grabs their
cigarettes and lighters and throws them in the trash.)
Kim| My late husband gave me that lighter. (Rachel laughs.) I'm not kidding.
Rachel| Okay then! (She starts rummaging through the trash to find Kim's
lighter.)
[Scene| Joey and Ben's audition, Joey is rehearsing his lines, uh correction, Joey is
rehearsing his line.]
Joey| Hmmm, soup! (Tries again.) Hmm soup! (Tries again, with a little
caveman thrown in.) Hmm, soup!
Carol| Joey, Ross is gonna be here any second, would you mind watching Ben for
me while I use the ladies' room?
Joey| Oh yeah, no problem.
Carol| Thanks. (Exits.)
Joey| (goes over to Ben) Hi Ben! So you wanna be an actor huh? I gotta tell ya,
it's no picnic. There's tons of rejection. No stability. One day you're Dr. Drake
Remoray, the next day you're eating ketchup right out of the bottle.
Ross| (entering, angrily) Joey!
Joey| (angrily) Ross!
Ross| (angrily) Ben! (Pause.) (Happily.) I mean, Ben! Ben!
The Casting Director| (entering) Okay, Raymond, Joey you're up.
Joey| Hi!
The Casting Director| Okay, uh well, let's try one. Whenever you guys are ready.
(Some dude puts down a couple bowls of soup in front of them.)
Joey| Uh-oh.
The Casting Director| Is there a problem?
Joey| Well this is noodle soup and uh, I've been working with tomato. But that's
okay, no problem. No problem. Hmm, noodle soup.
The Casting Director| Y'know, that's-that's fine, but the line is, "Hmm,
soup."
Joey| Oh, what did I say?
The Casting Director| Hmm, noodle soup.
Joey| How's that different? (She looks at him until he gets it.) Oh! Yeah!
The Casting Director| All right, let's try one.
Joey| Hmm, noodle soup.
The Casting Director| Okay. Let's do it again.
Joey| Okay.
Joey| Hmm, soup. (Pause.) I mean, noodle soup. I mean soup!
Raymond| COME ON!!!!
The Casting Director| Y'know what? We need to move on.
Joey| No! No! I-I can do it one more time! See? Look! (Eats another spoonful)
Hmm, noodle soup. Damnit! (Storms out.)
[Scene| The smoker's balcony, Kim and Nancy are cheating and are caught by Rachel.]
Rachel| Hey! Hey-hey-hey!!
Kim| Uh-oh, busted!
Rachel| Come on you guys! What are doing?! I thought we were the patch sisters!
Kim| Yeah. That didn't work out.
Nancy| Rachel we tried to quit, but it was too hard!
Rachel| Well y'know if you, if you started smoking again you could've at least
told me! Come on, give me one of those! What are we talking about?
Kim| No. No! You're doing great! Dont you give up! That's why we didn't
tell you and we're not gonna drag you down with us.
Rachel| Oh wait, no-no-no! Drag me down. Drag-drag me down.
Kim| Forget it Rachel! We're both so proud of how well you're doing. I'm not
gonna let you blow it. In fact, if I catch you with a cigarette, you're fired. So go on,
get out of here! Go on, I don't want you breathing this stuff! Go on!
Rachel| Okay. (Starts to walk away.)
Kim| (to Nancy) So, okay! So you'll come with me on the Paris trip.
Rachel| (hearing that) Oh man!
[Scene| Monica and Rachel's, Rachel's surprise party. The apartment is festooned with
cups. There are cups everywhere! Cup centerpiece, cup garland, etc., etc]
Phoebe| (To Chandler) Check it out! Cup hat! (Points to her hat.) Cup banner!
Cup chandelier! And the thing that started it all, the cup! (Holds up one.)
Chandler| Great job with the cups, Pheebs!
Monica| (overhearing that) Why don't you just go out with her!
Phoebe| (following him) And did you notice the ice? (Gestures to 3 huge buckets
of ice on the table.) Look! We have it all! We have crushed! Cubed! And dry! Watch! (Pours
some water onto the dry ice, causing it to evaporate/smoke.) Ahhh! Mystical!
Chandler| Awesome!
Monica| Chandler! Everyone--no one's eating my Tuscan finger food 'cause they're
all filling up on Phoebe's snow cones!
Chandler| There are snow cones! (Monica glares at him.) Snow cones! Yuck!
Monica| Y'knowgo! Go! Right there! (Points)
Chandler| Thank you! Thank you! (Runs to the snow cone machine.)
Phoebe| (noticing her) Oh, look! Look! Look!
All| Surprise!!
Rachel| What?! What?! My birthday's not for another month!
Monica| That's the surprise!
Rachel| Oh my God! You guys this is so great! I mean it's so unexpected! I mean
Chandler's birthday is even before mine!
All| Surprise!
Rachel| Wow! This is great! Look at all these cups! This is so weird.
Phoebe| I was in charge of cups.
Rachel| Oh, okay, not so weird.
Ross| Hey!
Joey| Hey.
Ross| Listen man, uh, I'm sorry the audition didn't go so well.
Joey| Yeah right! (Gets up for a refill to his snow cone.)
Ross| No really, I-I am! I feel bad!
Joey| Yeah? Well look Ross, you don't have to. Okay? It's not your fault I suck.
I mean what kind of an actor can't even say, "Hmm, noodle soup." (Nods his head
in disgust.)
Ross| Yeah y'know what? Maybe-maybe you didn't mess up your audition because you
suck, maybe you messed up because you care more about uh, your godson.
Joey| What you do mean?
Ross| I think, sub-consciously
Joey| Wait-whoa-whoa, you lost me.
Ross| (pause) I think on some level, you-you sabotaged your own audition so that
Ben would get the part.
Joey| Well, you're way sounds a lot better than mine. (Thinks about it.) Yeah.
Yeah! It's not that I'm a bad actor
Ross| No!
Joey| No, it's just ah, I care so damn much about little Ben that uh, it was
more important to see him succeed.
Ross| There you go. Thank you!
Joey| Thank you! So, did-did he get it?
Ross| No.
Joey| Eh, what are you gonna do?
[Scene| The smoker's balcony, Kim and Nancy are out smoking as Chandler sticks his head
out the door.]
Chandler| (to Kim and Nancy) Oh, hi! Excuse me, is uh Rachel Green here? I was
supposed to meet her for lunch.
Kim| Oh, she doesn't come down here any more. You can find her up on ten.
Chandler| Okay, great.
Kim| (to Nancy) So we talked about the (Chandler sneaks closer to her cigarette)
whole presentation yesterday at lunch (Closer) and he wondered if one person would be
enough (Closer) to get a take on the trip (Still closer) and I said, "Yeah,
absolutely!" (She's interrupted by Chandler who has reached his goal and takes a drag
from her cancer stick.)
Chandler| I'll catch you guys later. (Exits.)
[Scene| Chandler and Joey's, Chandler is getting ready for a date with Monica as Ross
enters.]
Ross| Hey!
Chandler| Hey!
Ross| Wow! You look nice. What's the occasion?
Chandler| Monica and I are celebrating our ten-month anniversary, we've got
reservations at Ja George.
Ross| Wow! How'd you get in there?
Delivery Girl|
Chandler| Hey Caitlin! Somebody got a haircut.
Caitlin| Ugh, I hate it! I look like an 8-year-old boy.
Chandler| Yeah, if that was true, gym class would've been a lot more
interesting.
Caitlin| It's uh, 27 dollars even.
Chandler| Oh, okay. (Hands her the money.) Here you go.
Caitlin| Hey, where's the chicken?
Chandler| Oh, he's in the back. The duck pissed him off, said that eggs came
first.
Caitlin| (laughs) Great. I'll see you later!
Chandler| Okay, bye!
Ross| What the hell was that?!
Chandler| What?
Ross| The flirting! Aren't you supposed to be going out with, I don't know hmm,
let's say my sister?!
Chandler| I was not flirting.
Ross| It was totally flirting. "Somebody got a haircut (Makes some whiney,
nasally noises.)"
Chandler| Okay first of all, the impression, uncanny. And second, that was not
flirting, that was just casual conversation between two people. That is all.
Ross| Yeah, right.
Chandler| You wanna see flirting? I'll show you flirting. (Starts to move
towards Ross.)
Ross| (backing away) I'm good.
[Scene| Monica and Rachel's, Rachel and Phoebe are in the kitchen.]
Rachel| I am so proud of Joey, I can't believe he's going to be on Law &
Order!
Phoebe| I know. But don't you think that it should be called Order and Law?
Rachel| No because first they arrest the guy and then they try him.
Phoebe| Don't get me started on that.
Chandler| I was not flirting.
Ross| And on your anniversary, for shame!
Rachel| What's going on?
Ross| Chandler was hitting on the hot delivery girl!
Chandler| I was not and oh God, shh!
Ross| Well I'm sorry but you were! Okay? And besides if anyone should be hitting
on her it's the guy who's single, the guy that who-who-who can do something about it.
Phoebe| Sounds like somebody wants to be Mr. Pizza Delivery Girl.
Ross| Well
Chandler| Is that what this is about? You like Caitlin?
Rachel| Ross! We broke up two years ago; you've been married since then.
I think it's okay that we see other people.
Ross| Well, I-I was watching her the other day at the pizza place.
Rachel| Hm-mmm.
Ross| And she's just so sexy and funny and has the cutest little
Rachel| Okay, y'know what? We don't need her measurements.
Phoebe| (looking through the pizzas) Okay pepperoni, pepperoni, pepperoni, okay
Ross, I know she's pretty and you love her, but is she stupid?! She forgot my vegetarian!
Ross| This is perfect! She'll have to come back here with your pizza, and when
she does, I'll turn on the Charm-O-Ross. Oh I'm so glad you don't eat meat.
Phoebe| See? Vegetarianism benefits everyone.
Joey| (entering, with his grandmother) Hey everybody, look who's here! You
remember my grandmother!
Rachel| Big night!
Phoebe| This is so cool!
Chandler| So, Joey on Law & Order, you must be very proud!
Joey| Chandler, she doesn't understand a word of English.
Chandler| I'm sorry, I thought you were Joey's other grandmother. (She just
stares at him.) I've done it again.
Joey| She's my biggest fan. Yeah, she's the only one in the family that's
believed in me.
Joey| Yeah, I uh weighted like 27 pounds when I was born so
Monica| (entering from the bathroom) Hey! Happy Anniversary!
Chandler| Happy Anniversary, 10 months! (They kiss.)
Monica| So umm, when I was in the shower I was thinking about our first night in
London
Chandler| Uhh, Joey's grandmother is right there. (Points)
Monica| Is that the one that speaks English or the one that doesn't?
Chandler| The one that doesn't.
Monica| That was some hot love you gave me! I'm gonna go get ready.
Chandler| Hey, why don't you wear those earrings I gave you?
Monica| That's a great idea! I was saving them for something special.
Chandler| Okay.
Monica| (runs over to Phoebe) You have got to go home!
Phoebe| But I like it here!
Monica| You gotta go home and get the earrings that you borrowed from me okay?
Chandler wants me to wear them tonight.
Phoebe| Okay, well I think that they're in my purse. Why don't you go get
dressed and I'll look for them.
Monica| Great!
Phoebe| Okay! (Walks over to Rachel) Rach, hi, I need those earrings you
borrowed.
Rachel| Oh, umm, okay, yeah, I'll be, yeah I'll be right back. (Goes to her
room.)
Joey| Wow Pheebs, you speak Italian?
Phoebe| I guess so. (See, the brief possession didn't affect her at all, like we
could really tell.)
Rachel| (She enters and hands Phoebe the earring) Here you go. Thank you!
Phoebe| Wait, Rach! Where's the other one?
Rachel| Oh what, you-you want both of them?
Phoebe| Rachel Karen Green, where's the other earring?!
Rachel| Okay, okay, okay, look, just don't freak out, but I kinda lost it. I
know it's in the apartment, but I definitely lost it.
Phoebe| Well, what am I going to tell Monica? She wants to wear them tonight!
Rachel| Tell her to wear her own earrings.
Phoebe| These are her earrings.
Rachel| Nooo! Nooooo! You lent me Monica's earrings?! I'm not allowed to borrow
her stuff!
Phoebe| Why not?
Rachel| Because I lose her stuff!
Joey| Okay, see that blind guy right there? I'm gonna bash his head in later.
Joey| Oh umm, my big scene is coming up. Big scene coming up.
Chandler| If you said, "Big lima bean, bubbling up." Would she
understand the difference?
Monica| (noticing Rachel crawling behind the couch) Rach? What are you doing?
Rachel| Oh boy, I just can't watch. It's too scary!
Monica| It's a diaper commercial.
Rachel| Oh yeah well, you know me, babies, responsibilities, ahhh!!!
Caitlin| Pizza delivery!
Ross| I'll get it! I will get that! (Runs over and opens the door.)
Caitlin| Hi!
Ross| Hi!
Caitlin| One uh, vegetarian pizza. That's $12.15.
Ross| Oh. Uh, by the way, if it makes you feel any better. I happen to like
8-year-old boys.
Caitlin| What?!
Ross| (I can't make it out.) The uh, your hair, before, your hair, you said you
thought your looks like an 8-year-old's, and I'm just saying I like it. The hair.
Caitlin| Oh. Thanks.
Ross| You understand I don't actually like 8-year-old boys.
Caitlin| Y'know, all I'm looking for is the money.
Chandler| Here you go. (Hands her the money.) Now stop bringing us pizzas you.
Caitlin| I'm gonna try. (Walks away and Ross closes the door.)
Chandler| You're welcome.
Ross| You couldn't let me have her, could ya?!
Chandler| What?
Ross| This is a girl that I really like and had too swoop in there!
Monica| What's goin' on?
Ross| Chandler was totally flirting with the hot delivery girl!
Chandler| Thank you for that! (To Monica) I was not flirting.
Monica| It's okay. I don't care. It's uh, it's fine.
Ross| Really?!
Chandler| Really?!
Monica| It's no big deal, I do it all the time.
Chandler| (starts to laugh, but then gets serious) So umm, you-you flirt with
guys all the time?
Monica| Sure! It doesn't mean anything! Just like I know it doesn't mean
anything with you!
Chandler| Okay, but there is a big difference. You are a lot hotter than
I am.
Joey| (walking past) True story! (Goes and sits down.)
Monica| Chandler, this actually bothers you?
Chandler| Yes, it does bother me! And I think it would bother a lot of people.
Rachel, when you were going out with Ross, did it bother you when he flirted with other
women?
Rachel| Uhh, no, no, it bothered me when he slept with other women.
Ross| And thank you, for that.
Rachel| But y'know, I never really had anything to worry about. Ross was never
very good at the flirting thing.
Ross| What? (Mumbles) What-what, what are talking about? It-it worked with you.
Rachel| Oh! Y'know what? You're right! We meet, you flirted and then bamn
nine years later you had me!
Ross| All right, all right. You-you-you know what I'm going to do? I am going to
order another pizza and when Caitlin gets here, you-you--I will show how well I flirt.
Yeah! I will, I will get her phone number! (To Chandler) And not the one on the menu!
Phoebe| (entering from Rachel's bedroom) I found it!
Rachel| Ohh! Thank God! Where was it?
Phoebe| On your dresser.
Rachel| Okay that is the one we already have!
Joey| Okay, here's my big scene. My big scene's here! (They have two of the cops
on the street, then they cut to where they're entering an apartment.) Oh my God.
Monica| What?
Joey| (smiling) Okay, everybody just keep smiling. It'll kill my grandmother if
she finds out.
Chandler| (smiling) Well, what is it?
Joey| (smiling) Oh, they cut me out of the show.
Rachel| (smiling) What?!
Ross| (smiling) Are you sure?
Phoebe| (smiling) Maybe your scene's coming up?
Joey| (smiling) Not likely.  'Cause you see that body bag right there
Rachel| (smiling) Yeah.
Joey| (smiling) I'm in it.
[Scene| Monica and Rachel's, it's continued from before the commercial break.]
Phoebe| (smiling) This is terrible, what are you going to do?
Joey| (smiling) I don't know. This little, old lady lives for my career. When
they dumped me off of Days of Our Lives she almost died.
Phoebe| (not smiling) That's not good.
Joey| (smiling) No, smile! Not that face, smile! Everybody smile! (They all
smile.)
Rachel| (smiling) Joey, why don't you just tell her what happened? It's not your
fault.
Chandler| (smiling) If we keep talking this way, aren't we gonna freak her out
soon?
Grandma Tribbiani| (Something in Italian to Joey.)
Joey| Soon, soon, I'm gonna be on soon. There I am! (Points to the screen, of
course it isn't him.)
Grandma Tribbiani| (pointing at the screen) No! Sam Waterston!
Joey| No-no-no, that-that's me, that's me.
Grandma Tribbiani| No, it's Sam Waterston! Crimes and Misdemeanors,
Capricorn One.
Chandler| Doesn't know, "Hello." But she knows Capricorn One.
Monica| (following her) Phoebe! I have to have those earrings, we're going to
leave as soon as the show is over.
Phoebe| But I already gave them back to you!
Monica| No you didn't.
Phoebe| All right, I already didn't give them back to you, that's what I said.
(Walks away over to Rachel.) Where is that other earring?
Rachel| It's not here Pheebs, it's not here. Ohh, I went to Joey and Chandler's
last night! Okay! (Goes to the door.)
Phoebe| Make sure you check Chandler's jewelry box.
Rachel| Wait a minute. Chandler has a jewelry box?
Phoebe| Okay, we have like ten minutes. Do you want me to get into that now?!
Ross| (To Phoebe) Hey Pheebs! How's that uh, vegetarian pizza working out for
ya? You and those vegetables have a real thing going on, huh?
Phoebe| (she just looks at him) Why are you being weird?
Ross| Do you like it?
Phoebe| No, that would be, "Why are you being cute?"
Ross| Okay, I'm working on my flirting.
Phoebe| Ohh! I did not get that.
Chandler| So uh Monica, do you, do you like the Law & Order?
Monica| Yeah, it's good.
Chandler| See, I'm finding out all this stuff about you today, like you like the
Law & Order and that you flirted with every guy in the Tri-State area!
Monica| Chandler! (Joey and his grandmother shush them and wave them away, which
they do.) Okay, let me get this straight, it's okay for you to flirt, but not for me.
Chandler| Oh, I'm so glad we cleared that up. Look, I'm sorry, some things are
different for men and for women.
Monica| Go on, teach me something about men and women.
Chandler| Okay, I've already taught you so much already, but whatever. See when
you flirt with a guy you think, "I'm just flirting, no big deal." But the guy is
thinking, "Finally! Somebody who wants to sleep with me!"
Monica| No way!
Chandler| It's true.
Monica| Well that's pathetic!
Chandler| Again true.
Monica| And this goes for all guys?
Chandler| All guys that are awake. Then we go to sleep and then all the guys
from the other end of the world wake up and behave the exact same way.
Joey| (To Ross in the kitchen) All right, it's another commercial; I still
haven't told her!
Ross| Joey! This is like the last commercial. You've got like (checks his watch)
ten minutes left!
Joey| I know, I know! What am I going to do? (Thinks) Ooh!
Monica| No! You are not gonna run out and leave her here!
Joey| (dejected) Yeah, all right. (Thinks of something.) Ooh! (He quickly runs
out before anyone can stop him.)
Grandma Tribbiani| Joey!
Chandler| Uh, Joey is gonna be right back. Right back! (Tries to pantomime it
for her.) Meanwhile, let's-let's-let's talk about you. (Pause.) So, you're old and small.
Rachel| (entering) (To Phoebe) (whispering) Hey!
Phoebe| Did you find it?
Rachel| The earring? No. But look, I found my sunglasses under the couch! I've
been looking for these since like last summer. (Puts 'em on.)
Phoebe| Okay, those are my sunglasses, you borrowed them from me.
Rachel| Okay, calm down, here they are. (Gives back the sunglasses.)
Monica| (entering from her room) Phoebe! (Motions for the earrings. Phoebe gives
her the one-minute sign.)
Phoebe| (To Rachel) What are we going to do?!
Rachel| I don't know, I don't know.
Phoebe| All right well, we're just gonna have to tell Monica, that's all.
Rachel| Oh gosh, she's going to kill me.
Phoebe| I suppose I could tell her it's just all my fault.
Rachel| Ohh that'd be great!
Phoebe| Mon, can I talk to you for a sec?
Monica| Yeah, what is it?
Phoebe| Umm, I lost one of your earrings. I'm sorry! I am so, so sorry!
Monica| (shocked) Wow! All right well, I mean, what can you do? If you lost it
you lost it.
Phoebe| I will replace it, I promise. I feel so terrible.
Monica| All right, sweetie that's fine. You didn't do it on purpose.
Phoebe| No.
Monica| Look at you! Come here! (They hug.) Feel better?
Phoebe| Yeah! You're the best!
Rachel| Okay, wait a minute. Wait a minute, I-I-I, I can't do this. Listen
honey, this is, it's not Phoebe's fault. She lent me the earrings, and I lost it.
I'm so sorry. Honey, I feel terrible too. (Holds out her arms for a hug.)
Monica| (angrily) That is exactly why I do not lend you stuff!! (Rachel
looks over at Phoebe in resignation.) Okay?! I mean, first it's my jewelry! And if it's
not my jewelry, it's-it's my blue sweater! And if it's not my sweater, it's my sunglasses!
Rachel| Your sunglasses?!
Monica| Yes!
Phoebe| Oh, right! (Hands Monica back her sunglasses.)
Caitlin| (from outside) Pizza!
Ross| (running to the door) Oh, mine! Mine! Mine! (to everyone) Okay, here goes.
Prepare yourselves for some Class A flirting.
Chandler| Okay, hold on. (Pauses as he readies himself.) Okay. (Walks away.)
Rachel| Honey, you have nothing to prove. And if you really like this girl, I
don't flirting is the right thing to (Ross interrupts and shushes her.)
Ross| You'll see. Okay. (Readies himself.) Oh, what's-what's her name?
All|
Grandma Tribbiani| Caitlin!
Ross| (He opens the door while faking a laugh.) Hey! Oh, we-we can't keep eating
like this. (Monica turns her head in shame.)
Caitlin| It's uh, $12.50.
Ross| Okay, (gets the money) so, do you make the pizzas in one of those uh,
wood-burning ovens?
Caitlin| No actually umm, I think that they're umm, gas.
Ross| Gas? Wow! Intense.
Chandler| (To Monica) If this is the way all the Gellers flirt, we don't have a
problem.
Ross| (to Caitlin) Hey uh, y'know that smell gas has?
Caitlin| (wanting more than anything to get the money and leave this horrible,
horrible place) Yeah.
Ross| They put that in.
Caitlin| What?!
Ross| The gas is odorless, but they add the smell so you know when there's a
leak.
Caitlin| (getting more desperate to leave) Well okay!
Ross| A lot of other gas smells
Chandler| Oh the humanity.
Ross| Meth-methane smells
Caitlin| Y'know what umm, actually I, I really, I should go.
Ross| Oh but I-I-I haven't paid you yet!
Caitlin| Y'know what? That's okay, you guys have ordered so many that this one
is on me! (Runs for her life.)
Ross| (To All) Was I talking to her about gas?
Chandler| More so than anything else.
Phoebe| I-I-I found it interesting.
Rachel| I'm sorry.
Ross| Look, no-no, hey, hey, don't worry about it! In nine years, she and I will
be right there. (Goes and sits on the couch dejectedly.)
Rachel| Okay, well, I'm gonna clear out some of these boxes. (She grabs a couple
of the old pizza boxes and exits.)
Phoebe| (walking over to Ross) Ross?
Ross| Yeah?
Phoebe| What else do they add smell too?
[Scene| The street outside the building, Rachel is running to catch up with Caitlin.]
Rachel| Hey! Hey! (Stops Caitlin) Hi! Hey-hey-hey, I'm Rachel! From upstairs?
The ones with all the pizza?
Caitlin| Oh, is there a problem?
Rachel| No. No. Every thing's--they're fine. Great pizza. But it's uh, actually
umm my friend Ross. He uh, just gets really nervous when he's flirting.
Caitlin| Oh my God! That was flirting?!
Rachel| Yeah.
Caitlin| Wow!
Rachel| I know, I know, but uh just, I'm telling you, once, once you get past
that part, that where it-it just feels like you wanna die, he's-he's really a good person.
Caitlin| The guy with the gas?!
Rachel| Yeah. I'm-I'm telling you he's really sweet and he's really funny and
he's just ugh, got a good heart. And besides, I y'know, I think he really likes you.
Caitlin| Really?!
Rachel| Well y'know, we have 7 people and like 10 pizzas, what do you think?
Caitlin| I just, I thought Joey was there.
[Scene| Monica and Rachel's, Phoebe, Chandler, and Joey's grandmother are still
watching Law & Order.]
Rachel| (entering) Hey Ross? Umm, I just ran into Caitlin in the hallway and-and
uh, you must be getting better at this flirting stuff than I thought.
Ross| What do you mean?
Rachel| Well, I don't get it, but she wanted me to give you her phone number.
(Hands him the slip of paper with the phone number on it.)
Ross| And she just gave you this?
Rachel| Yeah!
Ross| Rach, thanks but uh, I don't need you doing me any favors.
Rachel| I-I-I didn't! I didn't! She thought you were cute.
Ross| Well that I can believe.
Rachel| Yay!
Joey| (entering) Hey! Is the show still on?
Chandler| Almost over man.
Joey| (says hi to his grandma) Look! Oh! (Pointing out the window.) Is that the
Pope?! (Chandler and his grandma turn to look and Joey slips a tape into the VCR.)
Chandler| Why am I looking?
Joey| Oh, here I am, here's my big scene!
Joey| (on the tape) All right back off! I gotta gun! I'm not afraid to use it!
Grandma Tribbiani| Oh Joey!
Joey| That's right!
Chandler| You couldn't have at least changed your shirt.
Joey| (on the tape) Now, I wanna a suitcase filled with 100,000 dollars. (The
duck quacks, to the duck) Choo! Choo! Choo! (To the imaginary cops) Filled with $100,000
in small bills, and if I don't get it(the duck quacks louder) Choo!! And if I don't
get it, (pause, picks up the duck) I'm gonna shoot this duck!
Phoebe| Oh no!
Joey| (on the tape) I'm comin' out! (He opens the door and hops out pointing the
gun in all directions and then runs out of view.)
Ross| (To Phoebe) And she's supposed to buy this?!
Grandma Tribbiani| Joey, bravo! (Starts with that Italian stuff again.)
Chandler| (singing) Ground control to Major Tom! Commencing
countdownengineson!
Joey| (to his grandmother) That's uh, scenes from next week's show. Next week's!
Phoebe| I am definitely gonna watch that!
[Scene| Monica and Rachel's, another time lapse, Monica is seeking advice from Rachel
and Phoebe about possible replacement earrings.]
Monica| What about these? These look the same?
Phoebe| Definitely!
Monica| Not as each other!
Phoebe| Oh, then no.
Chandler| (To Monica) Hey!
Monica| Hi!
Chandler| You ready?
Monica| Yeah.
Chandler| You look amazing. I'm the luckiest man in the world.
Monica| Ohh, you're about to get a little luckier.
Chandler| Let me see the earrings.
Monica| Oh, honey, the earrings
Chandler| (looking at them) They look great! Does your boyfriend have the best
taste or what?
Monica| My boyfriend really does have good taste!
Chandler| (To Ross) Thanks for picking out the earrings man.
Ross| Hm-mmm.
[Scene| Central Perk, Chandler, Rachel, Joey, and Monica are sitting on the couch as
Ross is up getting some coffee.]
Monica| Okay, guys, listen, don't forget that tomorrow is the day that Emily
gets married again, so whatever we do, just try to really keep Ross's mind off of it.
Joey| Oh, yeah, good idea.
Chandler| Hey man, what's up?
Ross| (sits down at the table) Oh, eh, just thinking about Emily getting married
tomorrow. (Joey panics.)
Joey| Ooh, Ross, look! Look! (Points behind Ross.)
Ross| (turning and looking) What? Where?
Joey| Right over there! Right there! Look-look-look!
Ross| What am I looking at?
Joey| (to the rest of the gang) Somebody help me out here!
Phoebe| (entering, with Gary) Hey!
Gary| Hello!
Monica| Hey!
Gary| How are you?
Phoebe| Monica, I'm sorry I didn't come by last night. I was out with Gary; he
let me ride around with him in his cop car. We saw and prevented crimes.
Joey| You got to go on a ride along?!
Phoebe| Uh-huh!
Joey| I want to go on a ride along!
Ross| Me too!
Gary| Okay!
Chandler| Yeah, yeah! Me too!
Gary| Really?! You?
Chandler| Yeah.
Gary| Well, it's kinda dangerous.
Chandler| Well, I like danger.
Gary| Okay, you guys free tonight?
Joey and Ross|
Chandler| Tonight? You-you didn't say it was going to be at nighttime.
[Scene| Monica and Rachel's, Monica is kneeling at the coffee table and has a bunch of
pictures laid out in front of her as Rachel enters.]
Rachel| Hey!
Monica| Hey! Oh, I'm so glad you're home, I thought tonight we could finally
organize these photos!
Rachel| Ohh, thank God! Finally!
Monica| Okay, I've broken them down into categories. Okay, we have uh, we got
holidays, birthdays, candids, y'know And then what I've done is I've
cross-referenced them by subject. Right? So if you're looking up, oh let's say birthdays
and dogs, you get Photo 152. See? (Hands her the photo.)
Rachel| Ohh, it's me and La Poo! Wow! I miss that dog.
Monica| You can also find him under umm, dog and dead.
Rachel| Great! Thanks!
Monica| All right, hand me that other box of photos; that's the very last one.
Rachel| Okay.
Rachel| Oops. Sorry! Well, good thing you number all of them, huh?
Monica| I hadn't! Photo 152 was a prototype.
Rachel| Ohhhh. Honey, honey, honey, it's okay, it's okay honey. I'm gonna fix
you a drink, huh? Maybe a margarita?
Ross| Ross has the blender! Ugh, everything's just falling apart!
Rachel| No honey, it's okay! Listen, I'll got to Ross's and get the blender, you
get all the margarita stuff ready.
Monica| All right, he's keys are in the drawer. Y'know what? I also need some
cash.
Rachel| Okay, you want me to stop at the ATM?
Monica| Nah, while you're at Ross's if you see any lying around
Rachel| What?!
Monica| What?! I-I-I don't, I don't do that!
[Scene| Gary's cop car, Ross is in the front seat with Gary of course. Chandler is in
the back seat.]
Ross| (to Gary) That was so cool man, the way you leaned on that guy.
Chandler| It is starting to get dark out there.
Ross| (to Gary) He told you everything! I mean you totally cracked him!
Gary| Yeah well, being that he was the victim, they're usually pretty talkative.
Chandler| (laughing) Okay. (Deadpan) But it is officially nighttime.
Ross| Oh hey, Gary, want me to grab the berry for ya?
Gary| It's called the cherry.
Ross| It's theChandler!!
Joey| (returning from a deli) Okay, I got it! This place makes the best sandwich
in the world!
Gary| Hey Joe does it have meatballs on it?
Joey| Oh-ho, yeah!
Gary| Does it have melted cheese and marinara sauce?
Joey| Yep!
Gary| Yeah, you can't eat that in my car.
Joey| (dejected) Yeah okay. (To Chandler) Even though my tax dollars paid for
this car.
Chandler| Your tax dollars?
Joey| Yeah, okay.
Chandler| (leans in and takes a sniff of Joey's sandwich) Wow! That sandwich
really does smell good.
Joey| Did I say you could smell it?!
Chandler| I can't smell your sandwich?
Joey| Half the taste is in the smell! You-you're sucking up all the tastiness!
Chandler| Okay, I'll give them back. (Exhales strongly through his nose and Joey
just glares at him.) Look! What is so great about that sandwich?
Joey| Okay, imagine the best sex you've ever had.
Chandler| Okay.
Joey| Are you thinking about Monica?
Chandler| Yeah.
Joey| Yeah, what's that like?
[Scene| Ross's apartment, Rachel is just entering. She takes off her coat and heads for
the kitchen. As she does, she knocks something off of a bookcase next to the kitchen door
with her coat and it breaks.]
Rachel| Ohh please don't be from a real dinosaur! Please! Please! Please!
Please! Please! Please! Please! Please! (She picks up the 2 pieces and looks at the
stand.) Made in Mexico! Yes!! Ugh, who would buy this?! (Looks for a place to hide it and
finds a wall sconce and drops the pieces into it and heads into the kitchen as the phone
rings.)
Monica| (on the answering machine) Rach! It's me! Pick up!
Rachel| Hey! What's up?!
Monica| I need a few more things to make the margaritas. Uhh, I need some salt,
some margarita mix, and tequila.
Rachel| So all we have is ice?
Monica| See if he has ice.
Rachel| Okay.
Emily| (on answering machine) Hello Ross? It's Emily. (Rachel runs back into the
room with the tequila.) I know this is out of the blue but uh, I'm getting married
tomorrow. Well, maybe I am. I keep thinking about you and I'm wondering if-if we made a
mistake giving up so fast. Are you thinking about me? Of course you're not, but if you
are, call me tonight. Okay, bye.
Rachel| Oh. Oh! (Takes a slug of tequila.)
[Scene| The ride along.]
Ross| So where are we going next?
Gary| This witness won't return my calls so we're gonna see if we can surprise
him coming home.
Chandler| Sur-surprise him? We're not, we're not gonna make anybody mad are we?
Joey| Come on man! (To Gary) Listen so uh, are you gonna squeeze the perps shoes
a little bit before he lawyers up?
Gary| It's a witness not a perp. And no one talks like that!
Ross| Yeah, no one talks like that!
Joey| Oh what? Like your Mr. Cop!
Ross| Hey, I'm more cop than you two!
Chandler| How do you figure that?
Ross| Hello! I'm in the front seat, okay? I'm Gary's partner!
Chandler| Y'know, when you say partner it doesn't sound cop. It, it sounds gay.
Ross| Umm, jealous! (He drops the cherry and it turns on.)
Gary| Hey, do you mind? We're under cover here.
Ross| Yeah, no problem. (Tries to turn it off.)
Gary| Ross!
Ross| Sorry! Sorry! Oh, (He sticks it under his shirt) there! (It's just there
flashing through his shirt) Hey Gary, who am I? Phone home!
Chandler| Look at Officer Ross riding back here with the visitors.
Joey| Yeah, what's up with that Serpico?
[Scene| Ross's apartment, Rachel is playing Emily's message to Monica.]
Emily| (on answering machine) Are you thinking about me? Of course you're not,
but if you are, call me tonight. Okay, bye.
Monica| (does Rachel's) Nooo!
Rachel| (does Monica's) I know!
Monica| Well thank God you were here! I mean, we have to erase that!
Rachel| What?! We can't do that!
Monica| We have too! I mean what if Ross's hears that and then calls her back
and then they get back together? Is that what you want? Ross back with that controlling,
neurotic, crazy Emily? The Emily that wouldn't let him see you?
Rachel| Noo! Oh no! No! God no! He should not get back together with her. I know
that! You know that! Even Ross knows that! But that still doesnt give us the right
to erase his message!
Monica| I'm his sister, okay? I love him! I don't want to see him get hurt! Come
on! Doesnt that give me the right to control himhelp him?
Rachel| I don't think he's the one who needs help.
Monica| No, look, she's obviously unstable, okay? I mean she's thinking about
running out on her wedding day. (Rachel slowly turns and glares at her.) (Realizing what
she just said.) Okay, fine! But I mean, look at the position she's putting him in! What's
he gonna do? Ross is gonna run over there on the wedding day and break up the marriage?! I
mean, who would do that?! (Rachel again turns and glares at her in disgust.) Okay, fine,
all right, but that's y'know, it's different! Although it did involve a lot of the same
people.
Rachel| Ugh!
Monica| Y'know what, this is obviously some kind of twisted joke she's trying to
play on him.
Rachel| Okay, you are crazy! I'm sorry, but she sounded generally upset!
I mean, listen! (She hits a button on the machine.)
Answering Machine|
Rachel| Noooooooo!
[Scene| The ride along, they're all waiting outside of the witness's house and still in
the car in the same places as before.]
Chandler| Okay, y'know, we-we're safe right? I mean nothing bad can go down!
Gary| No. But that reminds me, (handing back a clipboard) sign this.
Ross| What is it?
Gary| Oh it's nothing, it just says that you can't sue the city if you scrap
your knee or y'know, get your head blown off.
Chandler| (deadpan) Oh, hurry up. I want to sign that.
Gary| Okay, here he comes. What is he doing? What the hell is he doing?!
Ross| What? What? What? What is it?
Joey| Is everything okay?
Chandler| What's going on?
Gary| Okay, he sees us. Now don't move. Don't look at him.
Gary| Hey, it's okay. It was just a car backfire. (Joey slowly moves off of
Ross.) Hey, look at that! You tried to save your buddy. You see that? You see what he did?
Joey| (To Ross) You okay man?
Ross| Uh-huh. Thank Joey!
Chandler| Uh, HELLO!!
Joey| Hi.
[Scene| Ross's apartment, Monica has all the supplies she needs and is getting ready to
leave.]
Monica| All right, I guess we should go.
Rachel| No, wait. Wait.
Monica| Oh yeah right! (She grabs the money and shoves into her pocket.)
Rachel| No, Monica! Monica! We have to fix this!
Monica| There's nothing we can do. You erased the message!
Rachel| Yeah well unless we tell him.
Monica| Well, if you're gonna be totally rational about this, I can't argue with
you! All right? Fine, if you wanna tell him, tell him. I just don't want to be a part of
it.
Rachel| Oh, maybe that's Emily calling back to leave the exact same message.
Ross| (on the machine) Hey Ross! It's you! I just want you to remember this
feeling. You are lucky to be alive! So live everyday to the fullest. Love yourself, okay?
Okay. Oh, and also get stamps. Bye! (He hangs up.)
Monica| Wow! Play that message for Emily and this whole problem goes away!
Rachel| Right?
[Scene| Central Perk, the guys are returning from the ride along to find Phoebe already
there.]
Gary| Hey, anybody want to meet a hero?
Phoebe| (excited) John Glenn is here?!
Gary| No, Joey!
Ross| Pheebs, we had the most incredible night! Okay, so, we're in the
car
Gary| Wait! Hold on! (He goes over to Phoebe and gives her a kiss.) (To Phoebe)
Hi!
Phoebe| Hi!
Gary| (To Ross) Okay, go ahead.
Ross| Okay, okay, so we're in the car. Right? And bang! A shot was fired.
And Joey with no regard for his own safety throws himself on me!
Phoebe| My God, Joey!
Chandler| (pouting) It was a car backfire!
Ross| Yeah, but-but he didn't know that!
Joey| Yeah, I didn't know that.
Ross| And it could've just as easily have been a bullet.
Gary| Hey Joe, you ever think about joining the force? We could use a guy like
you.
Chandler| Who jumps at loud noises!
Ross| Wow! I could've died tonight.
Chandler| Yeah! If the car that backfired had run over you! Y'know what, I think
I'll go home before Ross starts rambling about his newfound respect for life. (He gets up
and starts for the door.)
Ross| I do have a newfound respect for life.
Chandler| (returning) Oh my God! (Storms out.)
Gary| (To Phoebe) So you wanna get some dinner?
Phoebe| Yeah! Sure! Yep! (Gets up) Oh, y'know what? If I heard a shot right now,
I'd throw my body on you.
Gary| Oh yeah? Well maybe you and I should take a walk through a bad
neighborhood.
Phoebe| Okay!
Gary| All right.
Phoebe| Bye!
Ross and Joey|
Joey| Cut it out Ross! I hate to have to save your life and kick your ass in the
same day!
[Scene| Chandler and Joey's, Chandler is pacing as Joey enters.]
Joey| Dude! How come you took off?
Chandler| Oh, I just went for a walk, around the living room. Whatever
Joey| Is something wrong?
Chandler| No. No I'm just tired. Y'know, from-from the walk.
Joey| Okay.
Chandler| You dove in front of Ross! Ross!
Joey| That's what this is about! Oh my God, you hate Ross!
Chandler| I do not hate Ross!
Joey| Of course you do! I saved him! You're mad at me! It all adds up! You want
Ross out of the picture.
Chandler| What picture?
Joey| I don't know, but I don't like what I'm hearing!
Chandler| Look I'm very glad that you saved Ross from the car backfire, but
y'know, it could've been a bullet and you y'know, you didn't try to save me!
Joey| Ohh, you're upset because you think I chose Ross over you! No!
Iknewyou could take care of yourself. Y'know, I mean Ross, he need help. He's
not street like us!
Chandler| When it comes down to it, you would risk your life for Ross before you
would for me. That's the bottom line.
Joey| Well, no, not exactly! All right, look, I, I wasn't trying to save Ross.
Okay? My sandwich was next to Ross. All right? I was, I was trying to save my sandwich.
Chandler| From a bullet!
Joey| I know it doesn't make much sense
Chandler| Much sense?!
Joey| Look Chandler, it was instinct! Okay? I just went for it!
Chandler| So you risked your life, for a sandwich!
Joey| I know it sounds crazy, but Chandler this is (Goes and picks up the
sandwich) the greatest sandwich in the world!
Chandler| So you didn't uh, choose Ross before me.
Joey| No! I would never do that! You-you're like my brother!
Chandler| Really?!
Joey| Yeah! In fact, to prove how much you mean to me, (He unwraps the sandwich
and holds it out for Chandler) here.
Chandler| Thanks. (He grabs the sandwich.)
Joey| No, eh, oh-oi, easy, it's not a hot dog!
Joey| How good is that?
Chandler| (with his mouthful) Oh-oi-ho, yeah!
Joey| See?
Chandler| Hm-hmm. (Goes to take another bite.)
Joey| Oh-whoa-hey, dude, what are you doing?!
Chandler| I thought you were showing me how much you mean to me.
Joey| Yeah. With a bite! (Takes back the sandwich.) Gee-e-e-eez!
[Scene| Ross's apartment, Rachel is trying to repair the thing she broke earlier, but
gets interrupted by hearing Ross at the door. She panics and throws the thing into the
kitchen. And runs to the couch as Ross enters.]
Rachel| Hey! Hi!
Ross| Rach, what uh, what are you doing here?
Rachel| Hey! Y'know what? You are in our apartment all the time! Okay?
This is, this is just a drop in the bucket mister!
Ross| Y'know, it-it doesn't matter. The important thing is that you're here.
You're my friend, and you're here. Oh! (He goes over and hugs her.)
Rachel| Okay, just a little scared. What's going on Ross?
Ross| The most amazing thing happened tonight. I thought my number was up. I had
an actual near death experience!
Rachel| What?! What? What happened?!
Ross| Okay, okay, we were on the ride along with Gary, right?
Rachel| Yeah!
Ross| And somebody took a shot at me!
Rachel| (gasps) Really?!
Ross| No, a car backfired, but (Rachel suddenly calms down) I thought somebody
was taking a shot at me. And Rach, II survived! And I was filled with this-this
great respect for life. Y'know? I-I want to experience every moment. I want to seize every
opportunity. I-I am seeing everything so-so clearly now.
Rachel| Because a car backfired?
Ross| (stares at her briefly) Okay, why are you here?
Rachel| Well, I-I-I don't know how this fits into your whole "seizing"
thing but um, Emily called you today.
Ross| You talked to her?
Rachel| No, she left a message. (He starts for the machine.) (Stopping him.) But
it-it kinda got erased. There's just (Pause) something wrong with your machine.
Ross| Well, okay, what-what did she say?
Rachel| Well, uh something about having second thoughts about the wedding and
did you guys make a mistake breaking up and uh, she wants you to call her.
Ross| Wow!
Rachel| Now, that-that was a good thing that I told you, right?
Ross| Huh? Yeah! Yes, of course!
Rachel| Okay. Thank you! Thank you! BecauseI'm sorry, all right. Because
y'know what? She didn't want menot important. The point is, I was right. Your
decision. Okay? I was right. (She starts for the door.) (Stops) Your decision.
Ross| Right. I guess, I guess I should call Emily.
Rachel| Okay, no, that's not the right decision. That's not, that's not right,
no Ross-Ross, come on! I mean, that woman made you miserable! Okay, Ross, do you really
want to get back into that?
Ross| Okay, look, yesterday I would've even considered calling her back, but my
ex-wife calls on the same day I have a near death experience. I mean, that-that has got to
mean something!
Rachel| Ugh, Ross! That was not a near death experience! That was barely
an experience!
Ross| You weren't there! Okay, maybe this is something that I-I'm supposed to
seize! Y'know?
Rachel| Okay, y'know what? Maybe, this is not about seizing stuff. Maybe this is
about escaping stuff.
Ross| Huh.
Rachel| I mean, look-look today you escaped (Pause) (Not believing it) death,
y'know? And maybe this is a chance for you to escape getting back together with
Emily?
Ross| That does make sense. Because I do wanna seize some opportunity, but I-I
really don't wanna see or talk to her.
Rachel| Well, there you go!
Ross| Yeah. Maybe today is just, close call day.
Rachel| (laughing) Close call day.
Ross| Hey, thanks Rach. (They hug.)
Rachel| Ohh, honey no problem. Okay. (Gets up.)
Ross| Oh wait-wait-wait! The message is blinking. Maybe you didn't erase it.
Rachel| Oh?
Ross| (on machine) "Hey Ross, it's you!" (Hits the stop button) Oh
yeah, no that's-that's an old message, nobody needs to hear that.
Rachel| No. (She heads for the door again.)
Ross| (looking at the coffee table where his money was) Hey umm, was-was Monica
here?
Rachel| Yeah.
Ross| Yeah, I want my money back.
Rachel| (going out the door) Yeah, uh you-you probably need that for stamps,
right?
[Scene| Central Perk, everyone is there.]
Ross| Hey Pheebs, has Gary ever been shot at for real?
Phoebe| Yes. Once. Yeah, a little. He kinda did it to himself. It's not really a
good story.
Ross| I wonder how I would react under fire, y'know? And not backfire but-but
heavy fire, like I was in a war or something.
Monica| Man, I would be great in a war! I mean, I really, I think I would make a
fantastic military leader. I mean I know I would make General way before any of you
guys.
Chandler| Before or after you were shot by your own troops?
Ross| I know where Joey would be. He would be down in the foxhole protecting all
of us.
Chandler| Yes, if the foxhole was lined with sandwiches.
Joey| Yeah, hero sandwiches. (Points at Ross who points back.)
Phoebe| Well you all know that I'm a pacifist so I'm not interested in war in
any way. (Gets up) But y'know what? When the revolution comes, I will have to destroy you
all. (Starts to leave.) (To Joey) Not you Joey.

[Scene| Central Perk, Gary, Phoebe, Monica, and Chandler are there.]
Gary| (To Phoebe) Would you like some more coffee, baby-doll?
Phoebe| I'm fine, thanks.
Chandler| (To Monica) Yeah, see, I can't pull of baby-doll can I?
Monica| No. I think we learned that from the sugarlips incident. I'm gonna get
some tea.
Chandler| Okay.
Chandler| Hiya doin' pumpkin?
Phoebe| Nope. (Chandler nods in agreement.)
Monica| So it looks like it's going really well for you two, huh?
Gary| I know, really well. In fact, I'm gonna ask Phoebe to move in with me.
Monica| (shocked) Oh my God!
Gary| What do you, what do you think?
Monica| I think that is so great! When are you gonna ask her?
Gary| Tonight, but don't say anything. Okay?
Monica| I swear, I promise. I promise. Oh my God, I'm so excited! {And I just
can't hide it! I'm about to lose control and I think I like it! Sorry, just
couldn't resist it.} All right, listen let me tell you, do not get her flowers.
Okay? Because y'know, she cries when they die, and there's the whole funeral
Gary| (To Phoebe) I'll see you after work sweetie. (Kisses her.)
Phoebe| Okay. Bye!
Phoebe| So, what movie should we see?
Monica| (sitting down) Gary's gonna ask you to move in with him!!
Phoebe| What?! Really?!
Monica| He just told me at the counter. He made me promise not to tell, but I
couldn't hold it in any longer!
Phoebe| I can't believe this!
Chandler| (terrified) Right, because it's fast. Because, it's so fast. It's
fast!
Monica| Relax! It's Phoebe! Not you!
Chandler| Oh! Good for you Pheebs, way to go! (Breathes a sigh of relief)
Phoebe| No, but it is fast. Isn't it?
Monica| Ohhhh!
Phoebe| No, I like him a lot but I don't think I'm ready for this!
Chandler| So, what are you gonna do?
Phoebe| I don't know. I'll just handle itI'll ask you to talk to him!
Chandler| Me?! Why me?
Phoebe| Because you are so afraid of commitment! You talk to him, make him
scared like you! Make him aman!
Chandler| I'll try, but I'm not sure what good it would do, y'know? Because I'm
a lot less afraid of commitment than I used to be.
Monica| That is so sweet! (She kisses him and turns to add some sugar to her
tea.)
Chandler| (To Phoebe, behind Monica's back) Still terrified, I'll take care of
it. No problem. (When Monica turns back he smiles and kisses her, when she turns away he
nods that he'll do it to Phoebe.)
[Scene| Monica and Rachel's, Joey and Ross are playing catch with a little foam globe.]
Joey| Hey Ross, is uh, is Staten Island really an island?
Ross| Uh-huh, that's why they call it Staten Island.
Joey| Ohhh. I thought it was like Long Island.
Ross| (he catches the ball and pauses, staring at Joey in disbelief) Also an
island.
Joey| Hey, what time is it?
Joey| Wow! You realize that we've been throwing this ball, without dropping it,
for like an hour?
Ross| Are you serious?!
Joey| Yeah. I realized it about a half-hour ago but I didn't want to say
anything 'cause I didn't want to jinx it.
Ross| Wow! We are pretty good at this! Hey! We totally forgot about lunch!
Joey| Oh, I-I, I think that's the first time I ever missed a meal! (Checks his
pants.) Yeah, my pants are a little loose!
Rachel| (entering) Hey, you guys
Joey| Hey!
Rachel| Is Monica here?
Joey and Ross|
Rachel| All right listen umm, I just bought something I'm not sure she's gonna
like it, and it's gonna seem a little crazy, but this is something that I wanted since I
was a little girl.
Ross| You bought Shawn Cassidy!
Rachel| Noo! I wish! Okay, you ready?
Joey and Ross|
Rachel| Okay! (She goes and gets her surprise and when she returns with it, Ross
stares in shock.) Check it out!
Ross| What-what is it?!
Joey| What the hell is that?!!
Rachel| It's a, it's a cat!
Joey| That, is not a cat! {I have to agree with Joey on this one.}
Rachel| Yes it is!
Ross| Why is it inside out?!
Rachel| Excuse me! But this is a purebred, show-quality Sphinx cat!
Ross| How much did you pay for that?
Rachel| Well, it was a little extravagant, but I a pretty good deal.
Ross| Yeah? How much?
Rachel| A thousand bucks.
Ross| ON A CAT??!!!!
Joey| It's not a cat!
Rachel| All right listen ball boys! My grandmother had one of these when I was a
little girl and it was the sweetest thing! I mean it was so cute, it would sit in my lap
and purr all day long, and I would drag a shoestring on the ground and he would chase it!
Ross| Free cats do that too, y'know. {Which reminds me, if I might get a little
political here, support your local animal shelter. Pet shops are not the place to
buy dogs and cats from, you get a much better deal from the shelter, plus they probably
won't die on you in a week and a half. If you want a leash, go to the pet shop. If you
want the dog for that leash, go to the shelter and save it's life. Now back to regularly
scheduled programming.}
Joey| It's not a cat!
Rachel| Ugh! Look you guys, I'm really excited about this! Okay? I don't care
what you think! I'm gonna go set up a little litter box for Mrs. Whiskerson. (They both
glare at her.) Well, what am I gonna call her? Fluffy?!
Ross| (To Joey) Hey, you wanna get something to eat or uh, do you wanna see how
long we can throw this ball back and forth? Huh?
Joey| Uhh, the ball thing.
Ross| Yeah?
Joey| Hey Ross, wouldn't it be great if we could go two straight hours without
dropping it?!
Ross| Uhh, yeah it would! Let's do it!
Joey| Okay!
Joey| (catches the ball) Uh-oh.
Ross| What?
Joey| I have to pee. And Rachel's in the bathroom!
Joey| Man, I didn't think we were gonna make it!
Ross| I know! (Looks at the ball in his hands.) Don't switch hands, okay?
[Scene| the 5th Precinct, Gary's precinct, Chandler has come to talk to him
about commitment. And as he's walking through the door he notices a couple of "Ladies
of the night" sitting there. (If you know what I mean.)]
Chandler| Hey ladies! What are you in here for? (Laughs at his joke.)
Gary| Hey Chandler, what are you doing here?
Chandler| Gary, I'm here to report a crime.
Gary| Yeah?
Chandler| It is a crime that you and I don't spend more time together.
Gary| (laughs, then suddenly serious) What's up?
Chandler| Well, I heard that you thinking about asking Phoebe to move in with
you and I thought maybe, we should have a talk. Man to uh, me.
Gary| Sure. Okay.
Chandler| Uh, are you crazy? Are you insane? If you live with Phoebe, you two
are gonna be y'know, live-living together!
Gary| Yeah, I-I considered that. I just know it would make me happy.
Chandler| You mean scared.
Gary| No, I mean happy.
Chandler| Scared? Happy?
Gary| Chandler, what-what are you doing?
Chandler| I am trying to open your eyes, my man! Don't you see, if you lived
with Phoebe she's always gonna be there. You're gonna get home, she's there. You go to
bed, she's there. You wake up and oh yes, she's there!
Gary| I know! I can't wait!
Chandler| Were you're parents happy, or something?
Gary| Listen Chandler, the way I see it is that I was lucky enough to find
someone that I really love. I justI wanna be around her as much as I can.
Chandler| Wow, y'know when you say it, it doesn't sound so scary.
Gary| So you know what I'm talking about, right?
Chandler| Yeah, I think I do! Y'know what? You move in with her! You move in
with her right now! Maybe I should in with Monica!
Gary| No, it's too soon for you guys.
Chandler| (pause) Yeah, you're right about that.
[Scene| Chandler and Joey's, Ross and Joey are still playing catch.]
Ross| now when they found the remains of the Mesozoic Mastodon they
discovered what appeared to be the remains of a Paleozoic Amphibian in its jaws!
How did it get there?!
Joey| Maybe this should be more of a quiet game.
Monica| (entering) Hey guys!
Joey| Hi!
Monica| Joey, I left my watch on the counter last night. (Goes to the counter)
It was right here, where is it?
Joey| I don't know.
Monica| All right, come on, I'm-I'm late for work!
Ross| How do you know? You don't have a watch.
Monica| Guys, could you please just stop throwing the ball for one minute and
just help me find it!
Joey| Oh, I don't know. Yeah, can't do it.
Monica| What?!
Ross| Monica, whatever you do, do not drop that ball!
Joey| Yeah, we haven't dropped it in (Looks to Ross.)
Ross| 2 hours, 27 minutes.
Monica| Really?!
Monica| (on phone, faking she's sick) I-I'm not gonna be able to make it into
work today, I don't feel very good. (Joey makes a high throw and Monica has to catch it
way over her head.) (Not sounding sick) Yes!! (Realizes what she just did.) (Sounding sick
again) Wow! Uh, for a second there I thought I was really better, but I'm not. (Hangs up
and keeps throwing the ball.)
Ross| Hey Rach!
Rachel| Hey.
Ross| Check it out! Almost 3 hours without droppin' it!
Rachel| Oh, wow! Congratulations, that's quite a waste of time.
Monica| Rach?
Rachel| Yeah?
Monica| You have scratches all over you, what happened? (Rachel's arms are
covered with scratches.)
Rachel| Well, it's my cat.
Monica| (shocked) What?!
Rachel| Oh yeah, I got a cat.
Monica| I don't want a cat!
Joey| Oh, don't worry, it's not a cat.
Ross| Yeah.
Rachel| You guys this cat is nothing like my grandmother's cat. I mean,
it's not sweet, it's not cute, I even dragged that little string on the ground, and it
just flipped out and scratched the hell out of me. And I swear, I know this sounds crazy,
but every time this cat hisses at me I know it's saying, "Rachel!"
Ross| Doesn't sound as crazy as paying a thousand dollars for a cat.
Monica| (To Rachel) What?! You paid a thousand dollars for a cat when you owe me
300!!
Rachel| Well, I was gonna let you play with it.
[Scene| Central Perk, Phoebe is drinking coffee as Chandler enters.]
Chandler| Hi!
Phoebe| Hmm, did you talk to Gary about the moving in thing?
Chandler| Yes I did, and I think you should do it.
Phoebe| What?!
Chandler| He's a great guy, y'know? And he loves you a lot, you are a very lucky
lady.
Phoebe| You are useless! Freaking out about commitment is the one thing
you can do! The one thing! And you can't even do that right! God!
Chandler| Im sorry. (Pause) If you ask me, I'd move in with him.
Phoebe| Ohh!! God! (Gary enters and she sees him) Ooh! (To Chandler) Get out of
here, good for nothing.
Gary| Hey Chandler.
Chandler| Hey Gar!
Gary| (To Phoebe) Hi sweetie. (Kisses her.) Hi, can I talk to you for a second?
Phoebe| Yeah! Okay. (They move to the couch.)
Gary| You look very pretty today.
Phoebe| Thanks! Okay. (They sit down.)
Gary| Here's the thing.
Phoebe| Yeah?
Gary| Y'know I really want to move this relationship forward.
Phoebe| Uh-hmm.
Gary| Because if you're not moving forward, y'know you're just moving backwards.
Phoebe| No that's not true. If you're not moving forward, you're just staying
still. And staying still is good. Watch this. (She stays still for a brief second.)
Gary| Phoebe?
Phoebe| Yeah?
Gary| I want you to move in with me.
Phoebe| That is so sweet. But don't you think it's a little too soon? I mean
there's so much we don't know about each other.
Gary| (disappointed) Oh. Oh-oh-okay, I get it.
Phoebe| I justI don't want us to jump into something we're not ready for.
Gary| (disappointed more) Uh-huh.
Phoebe| I really don't want to mess up what we have. I'm justI'm worried
it's gonna be a big mistake.
Gary| (on the verge of tears) Yeah.
Phoebe| Which is why my answer is yes!
Gary| (suddenly happy) Really?!
Phoebe| Uh-huh! (They hug.) I'm sohappy. (She's not happy.)
[Scene| Chandler and Joey's, Joey, Ross, and Monica are still playing catch, with
Chandler looking on. Joey throws the ball to Monica who catches it and whips it at Ross.]
Ross| (catching the ball) Monica! Stop throwing it so hard! We're on the same
team!
Chandler| Four hours? You guys have been doing this for four hours?
Joey| That's right baby.
Chandler| All right, let me in. (He jumps off of the counter to join in the
game.)
Monica| (jumping in front of him) No-no! Don't do it! Don't!
Chandler| What?
Monica| He's a dropper!
Joey| Oh yeah, that's right!
Chandler| I'm not a dropper!
Ross| It's really a uh-uh three person game, y'know?
Chandler| It's throwing and catching!
Ross| All right. (He gently tosses the ball to Chandler who catches it.)
Chandler| Oh! Oh! That's so hard. (Starts to juggle the ball, but loses control
and almost drops it and hands it to Monica.)
Joey| Whoa-whoa you guys, it's not a cat!
Monica| Oh myOh good God!
Rachel| (she's wearing an oven mitt to protect her hand) I give up you guys, I
don't know what I'm going to do with this thing!
Ross| Baking it didn't help, huh?
Monica| So, why don't you just take it back to where you got it?
Rachel| I tried! They won't take her back.
Chandler| Maybe that's because she's a minion of the anti-Christ.
Monica| Rach, why won't they take it back?
Rachel| Well, they said would but they would only give me store credit. I mean,
what am I going to do, get a thousand regular cats?
Monica| Look, if you want you can keep it at our place until you find out what
to do with it.
Rachel| No Mon that's not the point. I'm out a thousand dollars, I'm all
scratched up, and I'm stuck with this stupid cat that looks like a hand! (Storms out.)
Monica| Oh my God, the cat's made my eyes water! Don't-don't throw it to me! My
vision's been compromised!! (Quickly grabs a tissue to wipe her eyes.) Oh God! Okay. Okay.
It's okay. Man, that was close.
Chandler| Yeah, you almost overreacted to something.
Phoebe and Gary|
All| Hey!
Gary| We have great news!
Phoebe| We're moving in together! Isn't it great! Yay!
All| Congratulations! Congrats!
Phoebe| I know, I'm so excited!
Gary| So am I!
Phoebe| Well, you're not more excited than I am! No way! I'm the most
excited!
Gary| Okay, I'll see you at the station later.
Phoebe| Okay, yeah, I'll see you later! Don't forget about the moving in!
Gary| All right.
Monica| So you're moving in with him. What happened?
Phoebe| I couldn't tell him no. He got so sad. Maybe it'll be all right. I do
really like him a lot and probably do it eventually anyway and plus, think of all the
money I'll save on stamps.
Monica| Why, do you write him a lot?
Phoebe| No, I just heard when people live together, they split the cost of
stamps. Don't they?
All| Yeah! That's right. Yeah-yeah! Yeah!
Phoebe| Oh, I'm sorry, the oven mitts really freaked me out.
[Scene| Gary's precinct, Phoebe is entering.]
Gary| Hey, honey! Okay, so did you find any apartments? Anything in Brooklyn
Heights?
Phoebe| No, nothing.
Gary| Oh really?
Phoebe| Yeah.
Gary| Nothing at all?
Phoebe| No, as soon as something opens up we'll move right in. Unless it doesn't
have a pool, I need a pool. (Turns away from him.)
Gary| Phoebe, can I talk to you for a second?
Phoebe| Uh-huh!
Gary| Take a seat. You okay? You feeling all right? (Closes the door and takes
off his coat.)
Phoebe| (sits down) Yeah, I feel great. 'Cause we're moving in together.
Gary| So you uh, you checked the paper for listings in Brooklyn Heights, right?
You-you checked the Post?
Phoebe| Yeah, uh-huh, there was nothing. (Pause) Can I get some water?
Gary| In a minute. You-you checked today's Post?
Phoebe| Umm, yeah! Today's.
Gary| 'Cause uh, this is today's Post (produces one from the other chair)
and uh, these are the listings I found. (Points) Brooklyn Heights, two bedroom. (Points)
Brooklyn Heights, one bedroom. (Points) Brooklyn Heights, (points) Brooklyn Heights,
(points) Brooklyn Heights!
Phoebe| (looks at the paper) Are these for rent! I thought people were just
bragging!
Gary| Let me tell you what I think might be going on. (Phoebe looks down in
shame.) No-no-no, don't look at the table. Look at me. (Points to his eyes and she does
so) Okay, I think somebody asked someone to move in with them. And I think someone said,
"Yes" but now she's having doubts because things are moving to fast for someone.
Does that sound at all possible to you?
Phoebe| Yes. Yes! Fine! I am someone! You want me to say it? I have
doubts! (Pause) I'm sorry! (Puts her head down.)
Gary| Phoebe
Phoebe| Yeah?
Gary| Phoebe, it's okay that you feel this way. I mean it is soon. And
there's a lot of things we don't know about each other, and I just figure that everything
I really like. And the things I don't know, I get to learn about at someplace with both
our names on the mailbox.
Phoebe| That's so sweet.
Gary| Sweethart, but none of that matters if it's too soon for you. It's fine!
We don't have to move in together. I justI want you to be happy
Phoebe| Living with you would make me happy.
Gary| Phoebe, you don't have to say that.
Phoebe| No, I really wanna live with you! I wanna move in with you!
Gary| Are you sure?
Phoebe| Yes. Definitely! Yes! Let's live in an apartment that we both live in!
(Hugs him.)
Gary| Oh that's great!
Phoebe| Oh wait, one sec. One sec. (Goes to the mirror) Hey you! Behind the
glass! Who are you looking at! I've always wanted to say that when I was in one of these
rooms, (sees the look on his face) which was never!
[Scene| The street outside Central Perk, Rachel is trying to sell the cat.]
Rachel| Show cat! Quality show cat! Show cat! (A woman approaches.)
Woman No. 1| (looks into the box) Oh my God! What's wrong with your baby?!
Rachel| It's not a baby! It's a cat!
Woman No. 1| Eew! It's creepy looking!
Rachel| Oh no! No! It's actuallyit's very sweet. It's very sweet. Look!
(Goes to pet it and it hisses at her.) Yeah, do you want it?
Woman No. 1| (laughs) No, I hate cats.
Rachel| Well, so then what are you doing to me? Okay? Just get out of here! All
right? Move on!
Woman No. 2| Wow! What an unusual cat!
Rachel| Yes! Thank you! Exactly! You want it?
Woman No. 2| Maybe. I was thinking about getting a cat, I was just going to go
to the shelter (Good for her) but Okay, why not?
Rachel| Oh, terrific! That'll be $2,000.
Woman No. 2| What?!
Rachel| Okay, a thousand.
Woman No. 2| I thought you wanted to adopt your cat.
Rachel| Well, I do, but you're just gonna have to actually look at this as more
of an investment than a cat.
Woman No. 2| Okay, yeah, I just wanted a cat. (Starts to leave.)
Rachel| (makes some unintelligible sound to stop her from leaving) Obviously you
know how to haggle, so I'm not gonna try and take you on. Okay? So $800 and I don't call
the cops because you're robbing me blind! Blind! (Covers her eyes) Just take cat, leave
the money, and run away! Run away! (Uncovers her eyes and sees that the woman has fled)
Damnit! (To the cat) Cat, can't you at least smile or something?! (The cat hisses at her
again, it sounds like Rachel) Okay, did anybody just hear that? Anybody?
[Scene| Chandler and Joey's, Joey, Ross, Monica, and now Chandler are still playing
catch. The guys are exhausted and sitting around the room. Monica is still standing all
pumped up and being hyper-competitive yet again. {Okay! We get it! She's competitive!!
Must we see all the time?!}]
Ross| I'm starving!
Monica| Come on guys! Suck it up! We're closing in on ten hours! It's gut-check
time!
Joey| I don't know who made you the boss? All right? We (Ross and him) invented
this game!
Monica| Please! I made this game what it is.
Chandler| Not fun anymore?
Ross| I'm still hungry!
Monica| All right, there's some pizza at my place, we can all eat with one hand
right? Are you with me?
Ross| I am!
Monica| All right! Let's go! (Runs to the door.) Let's go Team Monica! (The guys
all stop and stare at her) All right, we can work out the name later.
Monica| Rachel! What is your cat doing in one of my bowls!
Rachel| It's not! I'm defrosting a chicken. (Pause) Oh, I uh sold Mrs.
Whiskerson.
Ross| Oh, thank God!
Joey| Did you get your money back?
Rachel| Yeah, 15 hundred dollars.
Monica| Wow! You made a profit!
Gunther| (entering with the cat) I just came for the red-velvet pillow.
Rachel| Oh yeah, there you go. (Hands over the pillow.)
Gunther| Thanks Rachel. And-and don't forget you-you can come visit her anytime
you want.
Rachel| Oh good, great! I'll-I'll keep that in mind. (Turns and walks away.)
Gunther| (To Ross) Hey! So what is this? Some kind of snake or something?
[Scene| Gary and Phoebe's apartment, it's morning and they're both waking up in bed.]
Gary| I really like waking up with you.
Phoebe| I like waking up with you too. (Looks out the window) Oh! It's such a
beautiful morning. (Some birds are singing outside the window) Oh, I can stay here all
day.
Gary| That would be great!
Phoebe| We could have breakfast in bed
Gary| Wait, just a second.
Phoebe| Okay. (He grabs his gun and shoots the bird.) Oh! Oh no.
[Scene| Monica and Rachel's, Hyper-competitive Monica, Rachel, Chandler, Joey, and Ross
are still playing catch. Monica is finally tiring while the rest of them are totally
exhausted and virtually asleep.]
Monica| All right! Come on Monica! Look alive! Come on, look alive!
Phoebe| (entering) Oh good, you're all up.
Rachel| Phoebe! It's 6 o'clock in the morning! Why aren't you at Gary's?
Phoebe| Oh yeah, that's over.
All| What?!
Chandler| Come on! Gary's such a great guy! Whatever the problem is, you can
work it out!
Phoebe| He shot a bird!
Chandler| Oh that is over!
All| That's terrible! I'm sorry!
Rachel| Phoebe, are you okay?
Phoebe| Yeah. Yeah, I'll be alright.
Joey| Oh hey, here Pheebs. (He throws her the ball.)
Phoebe| (catches it) Nah, I don't feel like playing. (She sets the ball down on
the table and everyone gasps.)
Monica| It's okay. It's okay. Just pretend that it didn't happen! Okay? No one
needs to know! I mean, Phoebe's not an official ballplayer! I mean, only official
ballplayers can drop the ball!
All| All right. Okay. I'm starving! (They all get up, thus officially ending the
game.)
Rachel| Phoebe, honey, wanna get some breakfast?
Phoebe| Yeah!
Monica| Okay! Okay, let's race! First one there wins! Ha-ha! (Runs out the door
and everyone watches her leave.)
Chandler| You guys wanna eat here?
All| Yeah! As long as we're here!
[Scene| Central Perk, everyone is there.]
Joey| Man that was great! Huh? Can you believe how long we threw that ball
around?
Rachel| Yeah, it is amazing it lasted that long.
Ross| I know. My arm is killing me.
Rachel| No, I meant with the dropper over here. (Points at Chandler.)
Chandler| Y'know, how did I get this reputation as a dropper? Okay? I'm anything
but a dropper. (We see various scenes of him dropping a football, a mug of coffee, the
phone, an apple, a Frisbee, a record, and the final scene has a ball bouncing off of his
chest. I'm not going to describe them, you'll have to see them.)

[Scene| Central Perk, everyone but Phoebe are there reading. Rachel is sitting on the
couch flanked by Ross and Monica. She suddenly stops reading and starts blinking her left
eye as if it's bothering her. The problem is that Joey is on her left and thinks she's
winking at him and winks back. Ross is watching this and isn't quite sure of what to make
of it.]
Ross| What's going on?
Rachel| Well, my eye is a little itchy.
Joey| Uhhh, mine too! Yeah.
Monica| (To Rachel) Wow! It's really red! You should go see my eye doctor.
Rachel| Richard? I'm not gonna go see your ex-boyfriend!
Chandler| Oh, Richard. That's all I ever hear, Richard, Richard, Richard!
Monica| Since we've been going out, I think I've mentioned his name twice!
Chandler| Okay, so Richard, Richard!
Monica| It's not Richard! Okay? It's this new guy and he's really good.
Rachel| Well, I'm sorry I'm not going to an eye doctor!
Ross| Oh God, here we go!
Chandler| What?
Ross| Anytime anything comes close to touching her eye or anyone else's she like
freaks out. Watch! Watch! (He takes his finger and moves it towards his eye.)
Rachel| (flinches) Ross! Come on! That's all right! Fine--Okay, I have a weird
thing about my eye. Can we not talk about it please?
All| All right, fine.
Monica| Hey Rach, remember that great song, Me, Myself, and I? (And on
the "I" part she mimics poking her eye.)
Rachel| (flinches again) Monica! Come on!
Ross| Hey, does anybody want to get some lunch? All those in favor say I? (Pokes
his eye)
Rachel| (freaks) Ross! Stop it! Come on!
Chandler| How much did I love The King and I? (Oh, you get the
point by now.)
Rachel| Chandler!
Joey| Me too! Me too! Me too! (Yeah, he does the same thing.)
Rachel| Just stop it! Come on!
Chandler| You okay there man?
Joey| Yeah, I got too excited!
[Scene| Monica and Rachel's, Ross, Chandler, Monica, and Phoebe are eating breakfast.]
Ross| All right, I gotta go. I'm taking Ben to the park.
Phoebe| Ohh, give him a kiss for me!
Ross| All right, bye!
Monica| Bye!
Phoebe| Bye!
Ross| Later! (Exits.)
Phoebe| (after he's gone) I am so sorry you got caught in the middle of that. I
didn't mean to be so out there. I am furious with him!
Chandler| Wow umm, calm down.
Phoebe| I'm trying, but man that guy can push my buttons!
Monica| Why are so mad at him?
Phoebe| Look, I don't wanna talk about it. Okay?
Monica| Well, it just seems that
Phoebe| You wanna be on my list too? Keep talking! Has anyone seem my list by
the way?
Chandler| Uh, no Pheebs. What's it look like?
Phoebe| Uh, it's a piece of paper and it says, "Ross" on it.
Joey| (entering, depressed) Hey. I just got off the phone with Estelle and guess
what. (Pause, then very excitedly) I GOT THE LEAD IN A MOVIE!!!!!!
Chandler| You got the lead in a movie? That's amazing! What's the movie about?!
Joey| It's called Shutter Speed, it's really cool! Yeah, umm, I meet this girl
in the subway and we fall in love in like a day, right? And then, she
disappears But I find out where she lives and when I get there this like old lady
answers the door and I say, "Where's Betsy?" Right? And she says, "Betsy's
been dead for 10 years."
Phoebe| Ohh-oh, chilling!
Joey| And the best part is, we're filming in the desert outside Vegas! (To
Chandler) And you know what that means buddy!
Chandler| Yeah, I know that means buddy!
Joey| Road trip! Yeah, we can rent a car! I just have to be there by Tuesday!
Phoebe| Oh wait, my grandmother's dead.
Chandler| Well, uh, we can talk about that too Pheebs.
Phoebe| No! No, her cab! She probably won't be using it; you can drive it to Las
Vegas.
Joey| All right! Thanks Pheebs!
Chandler| Whoa-whoa-whoa, what are we going to do about my job?
Joey| Oh umm, not go.
Chandler| All right, great, road trip baby! (To Monica) This okay with you?
Monica| Chandler! You don't have to ask for my permission. (Quietly) You can go.
Chandler| Thank you.
Monica| Hey Rach, come on! We're gonna be late for the eye doctor appointment!
Rachel| (entering from her bedroom) All right! Let's get this over with! Ugh!
(She walks by the table and notices that no one is looking and accidentally on purpose
knocks over the open cereal box.) Ohhh! No! Look what I did! (She starts walking through
the mess. {Also, notice the continuity error in this scene. Note the position of the box
and dispersal pattern of the cereal before and after the camera cut.}) Oh, I mean, look at
this mess! I mean, we're probably gonna have to clean this up! Y'know? We're gonna have to
reschedule!
Monica| No. If you thought this mess is going to bother me, you are wrong! All
right, let's go Blinky! (She ushers Rachel out the door, but before the door fully closes
she sticks her head back in.) Chandler!!!! (Chandler agrees to clean up the mess.)
[Scene| Central Perk, Joey is reading a map as Phoebe enters.]
Phoebe| Oh hey Joey! What's up?
Joey| I can't decide which route to take to Vegas. Hey, you've traveled a lot
right?
Phoebe| Yeah, I've been around.
Joey| Okay, so-so which route should I take the northern route or the southern
route?
Phoebe| Ooh, if you take the northern route there's a man in Illinois with a
beard of bees. {Okay, I must protest this, I've lived in Illinois all my life and know of
no man with a beard of bees! Wisconsin, on the other hand, might be a different story.}
Joey| Great! Problem solved!
Phoebe| But on the southern route there's a chicken that plays tic-tac-toe.
Joey| Well, back to square one.
Phoebe| Oh, I know a way that you can decide! All right, I'm going to ask you a
series of questions and you answer as quickly as you can.
Joey| (quickly) Yes!
Phoebe| Good, but wait. Okay, all right, here we go. Now I want you to relax.
Take a deep breath. Clear your mind. (Quickly) Which do you like better peanut butter or
egg whites?
Joey| Peanut butter!
Phoebe| Which would you rather be a fireman or a swimmer?
Joey| A swimmer!
Phoebe| Who would you rather sleep with Monica or Rachel?
Joey| Monica. Oh huh, I always thought it would be Rachel.
Phoebe| No thinking! No thinking! Tie or ascot?
Joey| Ascot!
Phoebe| North route or south route?
Joey| North route!
Phoebe| Bamn! There you go! Huh?
Joey| Wow! That was incredible! Beard of bees, here I come!
Ross| (entering) Hey!
Phoebe| Oh, this guy again. (She ignores him.)
Joey| Hey man, what's up?
Ross| Uhh, not much. You guys want to see a movie tonight?
Joey| Sure, what do you want to see?
Ross| I don't know, umm
Joey| Oh, I know how we can decide. Phoebe, show him your game!
Phoebe| Umm, no thank you. (She gets up and moves to the couch. They were at a
table previously.)
Ross| What's with her?
Joey| I don't know. But hey, I know we can decide. Okay, I'm gonna ask you
questions and you answer real quick. Okay?
Ross| Okay.
Joey| What do you like better action or comedy?
Ross| Action.
Joey| Who would you rather sleep with Monica or Rachel?
Ross| Dude, you are sick.
Joey| Oh, I'm sorry. I forgot you had that whole Rachel thing.
[Scene| Monica's eye doctor's office, Monica and Rachel are waiting in an exam room and
looking at this big white thing used to check eyes. I have no idea what it is, and if an
ophthalmologist happens to know what that is, let me know.]
Rachel| Oh my God! What does that thing do?
Monica| (looks at it more closely) Oh that's an eye removal machine.
Rachel| All right, I'm outta here!
Monica| I'm kidding! I'm kidding!
The Doctor|
Rachel| Hey!
The Doctor|
Rachel| So were done then!
Dr. Miller| Almost! But first, we gotta start.
Rachel| Okay.
Dr. Miller| This is a glaucoma test.
Rachel| Uh-huh.
Dr. Miller| Sit down.
Rachel| Okay.
Dr. Miller| But your chin here. (She does so.) Now, you'll feel a small puff of
air in each eye.
Rachel| (jerks back from the tester) What?!
Monica| A small puff of air, now come on!
Dr. Miller| Here we go.
Rachel| All right.
Dr. Miller| 123! (Rachel jerks back on 3.)
Rachel| I'm sorry. All right, I'll just stay in here this time. (Puts her head
back.) Okay.
Dr. Miller| Ready?
Rachel| Uh-huh.
Dr. Miller| 12 (She flinches on 2 this time.)
Monica| Y'know what, I'm gonna hold her head.
Rachel| Okay.
Dr. Miller| That's okay.
Monica| Okay. (Monica backs off.)
Rachel| Okay. Okay!
Dr. Miller| 12! (She flinches again.) (Gives up.) Y'know what? You're
young; you probably don't have glaucoma.
Rachel| (really excited) Great!! It was very, very nice to meet you sir--Ow!
Hey! What are you doing?! Are you crazy! (He took out that thing they use to look at
people's retinas and looked at Rachel's when she was shaking his hand causing her to
flinch and scream at him.)
Dr. Miller| Okay. You've got a small, minor infection in that left eye. I want
you to take these drops three times a day and you'll be as good as new.
Rachel| Yeah, no, I don't-I don't put things in my eye.
Dr. Miller| Okay then, I guess we'll see you back here in three months.
Rachel| Great!
Dr. Miller| And I'll fit you for a glass eye.
Rachel| Okay, just give me the damn drops! (Grabs them and storms out.)
Monica| Dr. Miller? (She covers her right eye and reads from the chart) P E C F
D.
Dr. Miller| Very good Monica! You know where they are.
Monica| I sure do! (She runs over to a drawer, opens it, and grabs a lollipop.)
(To Rachel) And you don't get one!
[Scene| Central Perk, Phoebe, Rachel, Monica, and Joey are there.]
Rachel| Y'know, I-I gotta tell ya, those eye drops are a miracle. My eye is a
100% better.
Monica| They're still in my coat.
Rachel| Damn!
Chandler| (entering) Hey!
Joey| Hey! You ready to go?
Chandler| Yeah, listen, how cold is it going to be there? Do I need a coat or
will all these sweater vests be enough? (Holds up 3 of them in different colors.)
Chandler| What?
Monica| I love you.
Joey| Man, I wish Ross was coming with us! Y'know? I'm gonna miss him!
Phoebe| Thanks a lot! I just got that jerk out of my mind!
Chandler| Hey, so where are we staying? Is the movie putting us up in a big
hotel suite?
Joey| Uh no, not really. It's an independent film y'know? So we don't have a
real big budget. I figured I'd just stay in your room.
Chandler| I see, but once you get your first paycheck you'll be springing a big
hotel suite, right? I mean, lead in a movie, they must be paying you a lot?
Joey| Oh yeah! For every dollar Shutter Speed makes, one penny of it goes right
in Joey's pocket.
Chandler| So you don't get paid unless the movie makes money?
Joey| Did you not hear the plot of the movie? "She's been dead for ten
years." I'm gonna be a millionaire!
Ross| (entering) Hey!
Joey| Hey!
Ross| I just wanna say good-bye to you guys and to see if you guys will
place a little bet for me, huh? Twenty bucks on black 15.
Joey| You got it!
Ross| All right!
Chandler| All right, bye-bye now!
Phoebe| Bye!
Rachel| Bye you guys!
Joey| Bye-bye!
Monica| I wanna say good-bye at the car!
Chandler| Okay!
Joey| Anybody want to say good-bye to me at the car?
Rachel| Oh honey, I'll say good-bye to you at the car if you don't mind the
puss.
Joey| See ya! (Walks out.)
Rachel| Well, wait a minute! The puss is good! It means it's healing! (Runs
after him.)
Ross| Hey Pheebs, what 'cha reading? (Phoebe ignores him) Pheebs? (Turns away)
Hello? (He sits down next to her and she moves over a bit.) Phoebe? (He moves closer and
she keeps moving away.) Phoe-Phoebe! (They end up hanging over the arm rest.) Come on! (He
grabs the magazine away from her.)
Phoebe| Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't see you there.
Ross| Phoebe, are you, are you mad at me, or something? 'Cause if are please,
tell me what it is I did!
Phoebe| Well, if you don't know I can't help you.
Ross| Well, I don't know.
Phoebe| Well, I can't help you.
Ross| Well, whatever it is I'm-I'm very, very sorry. Okay?
Phoebe| Apology accepted.
Ross| Okay. So we're, we're good?
Phoebe| Uh-huh.
Ross| All right. (Gets up.) I'll uh, I'll see you later, okay?
Phoebe| (quietly) Bye, fat ass.
Ross| ALL RIGHT!! Phoebe now come on! Will you please tell me what it is I did
that mad you so mad at me!
Phoebe| I don't know! I don't remember!
Ross| Well if you can't remember, can't we just forget about this?
Phoebe| Oh no, I am mad at you. I know that much. But, I am sorry about the fat
ass thing. You actually have a very sweet little hiney.
[Scene| Phoebe's cab, Joey and Chandler are headed across the George Washington bridge
on their way to Las Vegas. Joey is driving.]
Joey| Man, I'm getting pretty tired. You're might have to take over soon.
Chandler| We've been driving for a half-hour, and you haven't looked at the road
once.
Joey| Don't worry, it's out there! (Just then a horn honks and Joey quickly
looks at the road.) I think I just need lunch.
Chandler| Yeah.
Joey| You wanna eat? (Pulls out the twenty) My treat!
Chandler| Isn't that Ross's money?
Joey| Yeah. Okay. Ross's treat! Where do you wanna eat?
Chandler| I don't know.
Joey| Ooh, hey, I know how we can decide! All right, uh, I'm gonna ask you a
bunch of questions and then you have to answer real fast. Okay? So uh, clear your mind
Clear it right out! Clear it out! Clear!
Chandler| Okay!
Joey| Okay, uhh, would you rather be too wet or too dry?
Chandler| Too dry.
Joey| Do you believe in ghosts, yes or no?
Chandler| No!
Joey| Is this movie gonna be my big break?
Chandler| No!
Joey| (shocked) What?!
Chandler| Yes.
Joey| Dude you said, "No!"
Chandler| I also said, "Yes!"
Joey| You don't think this is going to be a big break for me?
Chandler| No! (Realizes) Ahhh!!!
Joey| I don't believe this!
Chandler| Look Joe, I just, I just don't want to get your hopes up real high.
Joey| What are you talking about?! I'm the lead in a movie!
Chandler| They're not even paying ya! This doesn't even sound like a real movie!
Joey| Y'know what? I don't need this! Okay? I don't know why you're dumping all
over my big break.
Chandler| Joe, I don't think this is going to be your big break.
Joey| Is that why you're on this trip, huh? Make me feel like a loser? 'Cause if
it is, I'll tell ya, I-I-I'd rather be alone.
Chandler| Oh, you don't want me on the trip?
Joey| Not if you're gonna be like this!
Chandler| All right, I'll tell ya what, the next time you ask me a question like
that I'll lie.
Joey| Yeah! I don't want you on the trip!
Chandler| All right, fine! Fine! Why don't you pull over? I'll get out right
now!
Joey| Fine! (He slams on the brakes, stopping the car on the bridge to the sound
of numerous car horns.) Get out!
Chandler| You're not actually supposed to stop on the bridge.
Joey| Get out!!
Chandler| All right!! (Gets out and Joey speeds away.) Wait! Wait, there's no
sidewalk! Yeah, I'm gonna die here.
[Scene| Central Perk, Ross, Phoebe, Rachel, and Monica are there. Ross is trying to
figure out why Phoebe's mad at him.]
Ross| Okay, are you mad at me because my hair gel smells?
Phoebe| No.
Ross| Are you angry at me because I said your handwriting is childlike?
Phoebe| No that made me feel precious.
Monica| Oh, I know! Umm, is it because he's always correcting people's grammar?
Whom! Whom! Sometimes it's who!
Ross| Yeah? Sometimes it's (Does the fist thing.)
Rachel| Oh, did you beat him at a board game? He turns into such a baby when he
starts to lose.
Ross| Okay, I'm the baby. (Points at his eye.)
Rachel| Eh! Stop it!
Chandler| (entering) Hey!
Monica| Chandler! What are you doing here?
Ross| Hey!
Chandler| Joey kicked me out of the car on the George Washington bridge!
All| Why?!
Chandler| I don't know! He went crazy! Y'know, we were playing that game where
you-you ask a question and you answer it really fast.
Phoebe| That game should not be played without my supervision.
Chandler| Well, I don't know what mad him so mad, y'know? All I said was that
uh, I didn't think this wasn't gonna be his big break, that this movie wasn't going to do
anything for him, and that uh, y'know it didn't sound like a real movie--Okay, he
should've pushed me off of the bridge.
Phoebe| What's in the bag?
Chandler| Oh, I figured you guys would all be mad at me. So I got you some gifts
that I found on the side of the road. (Looks into the bag.) Who wants the teddy bear with
one leg?
Phoebe| I do!
[Scene| Monica and Rachel's, Rachel is trying to apply her eye drops while Monica looks
on.]
Rachel| Okay. (She tilts her head back and squeezes the eyedropper. The only
problem is, it's not over her eye.)
Monica| Not even close.
Rachel| Okay, then y'know what? Help me! I need help! I can't do this!
Monica| Okay! All right! Let's do it!
Rachel| All right!
Monica| Sit down. (They sit down on the couch.)
Rachel| All right.
Monica| Put your head back.
Rachel| Yes!
Monica| All right.
Rachel| Okay.
Monica| Now, open your eyes.
Rachel| Okay, they are. (No they're not.)
Monica| How many fingers am I holding up? (She's not holding any up.)
Rachel| (thinks) Four.
Monica| Oh my God, I was thinking four.
Rachel| Really?!
Monica| Yes! All right, y'know what? Why don't we start with a practice run?
Okay?
Rachel| Okay!
Monica| No drops!
Rachel| Great!
Monica| Okay.
Rachel| Okay.
Monica| On three, 123! (Rachel turns her head on three to avoid the
drops.) Now my pillow's all wet! (She was trying to fool Rachel and squeezed the
eyedropper.)
Rachel| Well, well, you said it was practice!
Monica| Then why did you move?!
Rachel| Because I knew you were lying!
Monica| All right, come here! (She gets up and drags Rachel off of the couch by
her legs.)
Rachel| (as she's being dragged) What are you? Monica!! Stop it!! Oh my God!
Stop it! (Monica drags her totally onto the floor and on her back.)
Monica| I am going I'm going--Turn it over! (Rachel rolled onto her
stomach and Monica rolls her back.) I'm I am going to get these drops in your eyes.
(She is holding Rachel down with both hands and has the eyedropper in her mouth.)
Rachel| Oh my God! You really are freakishly strong!
Rachel| Monica! Stop it!
Monica| (spitting out the eyedropper) Damn! It's empty!
Rachel| Wow, y'know if Joey and Chandler walked in right now, we could make a
fortune! (Monica is straddling Rachel and holding her arms down. In a rather risqué pose,
at least for primetime TV.)
[Scene| Monica and Rachel's, time lapse, Phoebe and Monica are playing cards as the
phone rings.]
Phoebe| Ooh that is definitely Chandler, Joey, or Ross. (Thinks) Or-or Rachel!
Monica| (answers the phone) Hello? (Listens.) (To Phoebe) It's Joey. (Phoebe's
proud of herself.) (To Joey) I'm so glad you called! Chandler told me what happened.
Y'know he's really upset about it.
Joey| (on a pay phone holding a box) Not as upset as he's gonna be when he finds
out what I did with his sweater vests!
Monica| What did you do to his sweater vests?
Joey| Let's just say there's a well-dressed pack of dogs in Ohio. Hey Monica
listen is-is Phoebe there? I gotta ask her something about the car.
Monica| Yeah, she's here. Hold on a second. (She hands the phone to Phoebe.)
Phoebe| Hey, dude!
Joey| Hey Pheebs! Listen, this wooden box keeps sliding out from under the seat.
What-what is it?
Phoebe| Oh that's my grandma. (Joey holds the box away from him.) And thanks
Joey she's having a really great time. (Joey is happy now.)
Chandler| (who has just entered) Is that Joey? Is that Joey? Let me talk to him!
I wanna talk to him!
Phoebe| Okay Joey? Chandler's here, he was wondering (We hear the dial
tone as Joey hangs up.) Okay, I guess he ran out of change.
Chandler| Y'know, he won't even talk to me. How am I going to apologize to him
if he won't even talk to me?
Monica| Well, maybe you should send him something. So that when he gets to Las
Vegas he'll know that you're sorry.
Chandler| That's a good idea. I wonder where I could (Pause) get a basket of
porn
Phoebe| No, don't-don't say I'm sorry with porn!
Chandler| Really?
Phoebe| Y'know what you should send him? A cartoon of cigarettes. 'Cause that
why he could trade it for protection. No. That's prison.
Ross| (entering) Okay Pheebs, I know how we're going to figure this out. Okay,
clear your mind and answer the first thing that comes into your head. Okay?
Phoebe| Uh-hmm.
Ross| What do you like better flora or fauna?
Phoebe| Fauna.
Ross| Who would you rather be Simon or Garfunkle?
Phoebe| Garfunkle.
Ross| Why are you mad at me?
Phoebe| You said I was boring--Ohh!
Ross| When did I say you were boring?!
Phoebe| Oh my God, I remember now! We were playing chess!
Ross| Phoebe! You and I have never played chess!
Phoebe| Oh, come on! Yes, remember that time on the frozen lake? We were playing
chess, you said I was boring, and then you took off your energy mask and you were Cameron
Diaz! (Realizes) Okay, there's a chance this may have been a dream.
[Scene| The desert outside of Las Vegas, Joey is arriving and we hear the song, Name.
Y'know, (singing) I've been through the desert on a horse with no name! It felt good to
be out of the rain. In the desert, you can't remember your name, 'cause there ain't no one
for to give you no pain. Lalala-la-la, la, la, la, la-la-la. You get the
idea. Anyhoo, he pulls up and stops. As he gets out of the car, he spills a huge pill of
fast food containers out of the foot well.]
Joey| Hey-hey! Stanley! Hey-hey! You're leading man is here! Let's get to work.
Stanley| Umm, slight change of plans. We've shut down.
Joey| Wh-what?! Why?!
Stanley| It's a money thing, we don't have any.
Joey| (laughs) You're kidding right?
Stanley| No.
Joey| What?!
Stanley| It-it's probably just temporary. We're hoping to get some more money
soon, so if could just uh, hang out.
Joey| Uh, hang out?! How long?
Stanley| I don't know. A week? Maybe two? The money will turn up! People will
always wanna invest in movies! Hey, you're not rich are ya?
Joey| No!
Stanley| Eh, worth a shot. (Gets into his car.) Look Joey, let me know where
you're staying, okay? (The car peels away.)
The Grip| Hey pal, are you Joey Tribbiani?
Joey| Yeah.
The Grip| These got left for ya. (He hands him a bunch of helium balloons.)
Joey| Thanks. (The grip walks away.) (Reading the card.) Congratulations on your
big break.
[Scene| Monica and Rachel's, the phone is ringing.]
Monica| (answering it) Hello?
Joey| (on phone from Vegas) Hey Monica, it's Joey!
Monica| Hey Joey! Aww, you remembered even though you're a big star!
Joey| Aw, come on! It'll be years before I forget you!
Monica| Joey, what's it like on a movie set, huh? Do you have a dressing room?
Do you have a chair with your name on it?
Joey| Uh, well yeah-yeah, I've got all of that going on. Yeah, listen uh, I want
you to make sure you tell Chandler that he couldn't have been more wrong! Uh-oh! I gotta
go Monica, my uh, my sushi's here!
Joey| (to the family) Sorry about that. Thanks for waitin'.
The Husband|
Joey| Everybody smile! (The picture is taken) Okay, thanks a lot! Enjoy your
stay at Caesar's! We hope it's toga-rrific! (The family leaves.) Kill me. Kill me
now.
[Scene| Monica and Rachel's, The gang is surrounding Rachel at key positions.]
Ross| Hey Rach, can you pass me the TV Guide?
Rachel| Yep!
Monica| Go!!
Rachel| What?!! Stop it! Stop it! Oh my God!
Monica| Okay! Okay! Okay! (She succeeds in getting the eye drops in and everyone
climbs off of Rachel.) We'll see you in about 3 to 4 hours.
Rachel| Oh! (She's trying to recover while still on the floor.)

[Scene| Monica and Rachel's, Rachel is sitting in the living room and Phoebe is
standing in the kitchen as the phone rings.]
Rachel| Pheebs? Could you get that? Please?
Phoebe| Why? Just 'cause you're too lazy to get up off your touchie?
Rachel| No! No! It's just that all the people in the entire world that I
want to talk to are right here.
Phoebe| (smiles) Okay! (Goes to answer the phone.)
Rachel| (under her breath) Sucker!
Phoebe| (answering the phone) Hello? (Listens) Hey Joey!
Joey| Hey Pheebs! Listen, uh can you do me a favor? I forgot the pin number to
my ATM card can, can you get it for me?
Phoebe| Sure! Where is it?
Joey| Uh, I scratched it on the ATM machine down on the corner.
Phoebe| Ohh! So you're 5639?!
Joey| That's it! Thanks Pheebs!
Chandler| (entering) Hey!
Phoebe| (to Joey) Ooh, do you want to talk to Chandler?
Chandler| (To Phoebe) Is that Joey?! (She nods yes) Let me talk to him!
Joey| No! (She nods no to Chandler) Because he didn't believe in my movie! Which
is a big mistake because it is real! Real!
A Casino Boss| Hey! Tribbiani! Get back to work! Break time's over!
Phoebe| Who was that?
Joey| Uhh, my stunt double. Yeah, and y'know, he's getting a little too familiar
for my tastes.
Chandler| (To Phoebe) Y'know what? I have been trying to apologize to him all
week! If he's not gonna let me do it on the phone, I'm gonna go down there and do it in
person.
Joey| Uhh Pheebs, I heard that. Can you put him on?
Phoebe| Yeah! (She hands the phone to Chandler.)
Chandler| (To Joey) Hey!
Joey| Don't come out here!
Chandler| No-no-no-no, I've supported you one hundred percent and I want to
prove that to you in person!
Joey| I got that! I forgive ya! Don't come out here!
Chandler| Forgive me? You haven't been taking my calls in a week!
Joey| Well, I'm totally over it Chandler. Friends forever! Don't come out here!
A Tourist| (To Joey) Would you mind doing a picture with us?
Chandler| Uh, what was that?
Joey| Uh, Entertainment Tonight. [Cut to Chandler] Yeah, okay so, good
talking to ya and don't come out here. All right. (Hangs up the phone and poses for that
picture.)
[Scene| Monica and Rachel's, Phoebe is entering.]
Phoebe| Monica! I'm sorry I'm late! (Starts looking around for her) Monica?
(Goes into Monica's bedroom.)
Monica| (entering) Phoebe? (Phoebe comes back into the living room) Oh, Phoebe,
I'm so sorry. Have you been here long?
Phoebe| (saddened) It's okay. What the hell took you so long?
Monica| Okay, you can not tell Chandler. Okay? That I ran into Richard.
Phoebe| Which Richard?
Monica| The Richard.
Phoebe| Richard Simmons?! Oh my God!
Monica| Noo! My ex-boyfriend Richard! Y'know the tall guy, moustache?
Phoebe| Oh! Okay, that actually makes more sense. So how was it?
Monica| It was, it was really nice. We started talking and I-I ended up having
lunch with him.
Phoebe| That is so weird! I had a dream that you'd have lunch with Richard.
Monica| Really?
Phoebe| But again, Simmons. Go on.
Monica| The strange part was, he was really nice, umm and he looks great, but I
didn't feel anything at all!
Phoebe| Ooh! So now why can't we tell Chandler?
Monica| Because it would totally freak him out and tomorrow's our anniversary. I
just don't want anything to spoil that.
Phoebe| Oh, I can't believe you guys lasted a whole year!
Monica| I know.
Phoebe| Wow! I owe Rachel 20 bucks!
Monica| What?
Phoebe| On a totally different bet.
Chandler| (entering) Hey!
Monica| It's almost our anniversary!
Chandler| I know. Can you believe it? One year ago today I was just your
annoying friend Chandler.
Phoebe| Awww! Now you're just my annoying friend Chandler.
Chandler| Huh.
Monica| I got you a present!
Chandler| Oh, but it's not 'til tomorrow!
Monica| I know, but you have to open it today! (Hands it too him.)
Chandler| Okay.
Monica| (grabbing the gift from him and opening it) Okay! There you go! It's two
tickets to Vegas!
Chandler| Wow!
Monica| For this weekend! Oh gosh, it would be perfect, we get to see Joey plus
we get to start our anniversary celebration on the plane. We can call it out
plane-aversary.
Chandler| Do we have to?
Monica| No.
Chandler| Okay this is great, but Joey said he didn't want any of us out there.
Monica| Oh, he just doesn't want us to go through any trouble. Think of how
excited he'll be when we go out and surprise him! Plus we get to have our own,
ani-Vegas-ary! A-Nevadaversary!
Chandler| Yeah, I think we should see other people.
Monica| But we can go, right?
Chandler| Yes.
Monica| Okay!
Chandler| It's a great idea. (They kiss)
Phoebe| Okay, I'm gonna go too!
Chandler| Y'know Pheebs, it's kinda our (His and Monica's) anniversary.
Phoebe| Oh please, you are not gonna ditch again like you did with London.
Monica| Ditch you? Phoebe, you were pregnant with the triplets!
Phoebe| Uh-huh, great story! I'm going!
Rachel| (entering with Ross) Hi!
Phoebe| Hey!
Ross| Hey!
Phoebe| Hey, you guys, listen, this weekend we're all gonna go to Las Vegas to
surprise Joey! Including me!! You wanna go?!
Rachel| Well, I guess I could take a couple days off work.
Phoebe| Of course you can take a couple days off work because this trip includes
me!
Rachel| Oh no, wait a minute, wait, I've got a presentation tomorrow. I can't
miss that.
Ross| Oh, but I've got tickets to the Van Gogh exhibit! I've been waiting like a
year for this.
Chandler| (coughing) Art lover!
Ross| What'd you say?
Chandler| I said art lover.
Ross| Is that supposed to be an insult?
Chandler| I don't know, I'm very tired.
Ross| So Rach, maybe you and I could fly out together Saturday.
Rachel| That sounds great.
Ross| Yeah? All right I'll call the airlines. (Picks up the phone and does so)
Rachel| Okay. Yeah, that would be nice actually, to have the apartment to myself
for a night.
Phoebe| Oh yeah, so you can walk around naked.
Rachel| No! So I can be by myself. Y'know? Have a little alone time.
Phoebe| Naked alone time.
Rachel| No! Phoebe just because I'm alone doesnt mean I wanna walk around
naked. I mean, you live alone, you don't walk around naked.
Phoebe| Uh-huh! Why do you think it takes me so long to answer the door?
[Scene| An airplane cabin, Phoebe has the aisle seat, Chandler the window, and Monica's
stuck in that horrible middle seat.]
Phoebe| So, so far is this trip to Vegas better or worse than the trip to
London?
Chandler| So it's pretty much the same Pheebs.
Phoebe| Okay, what about after I give you these candies? (Hands them each one
from her purse.)
Chandler| Yeah, I guess it's a little better now.
Phoebe| Ah-ha! Okay, (takes out a notepad) Las Vegas 1, London 0! I'll be right
back. (Gets up and heads aft.)
Chandler| (To Monica) Happy plane-aversary.
Monica| Aww! I love you!
Chandler| Can I give you a present now?
Monica| Okay!
Chandler| Okay! (He grabs his carryon and starts rummaging through it.) Oh man!
Dont tell me I did this!
Monica| I love the "I forgot the present" fake out!
Chandler| How do you feel about the, "I really did forgot the present,
please forgive me" not fake out?
Monica| Oh that's okay. Dont worry about it, you can give it to me when we
get back.
Chandler| Ohh that's the worse thing that can happen on an anniversary
ever!
Phoebe| (sitting down) Oh good! All right, so you decided to tell him about the
Richard thing.
Chandler| What-what Richard thing?
Phoebe| Oh no. [The patented version.]
Chandler| What Richard thing?
Phoebe| (To Monica under her breath) Simmons! Go with Simmons!
Monica| Okay, I umm, I ran into Richard yesterday and he asked me if I wanted to
go for a bite and I did. The only reason I didn't tell you is because I knew you'd get mad
and I didn't want to spoil our anniversary.
Chandler| (talking out of the side of his mouth) I'm not mad.
Monica| Really?!
Chandler| Oh yeah! Yeah, so you-you bumped into Richard! You grabbed a bite!
It's no big deal. (He still ain't happy.)
Monica| Great!
Phoebe| Okay, London 1
[Scene| Monica and Rachel's, Rachel is coming out of the bathroom after a shower
wearing only her bath robe, walks into the kitchen, and opens the fridge. As she bends
over to grab a bottle of wine, her robe falls open (Damn this network primetime
programming, we didn't see anything!) and she quickly closes it again. But then realizes
she didn't have to do that. So she closes the fridge and stands next to the table, thinks
about it for a little while and]
Rachel| (takes off her robe) Oh! Look what happened! {Don't get your hopes up
guys, we only get to see her from the back or from the neck up. Its times like these I
wish that the networks would broadcast some nudity other than Denis Franz's butt.} (In her
head.) Huh, check me out! I'm in my kitchennaked! I'm picking up an orange. (Does
so) I'm naked! (Goes into the living room) Lighting the candles, naked, and
carefully. (She backs anything that might have a point like a candle on her body
away.)
Ross| (in his head) Oh my God! That's Rachel naked! I can't look at that! I
am looking at this. (Looks back at his book.) Okay, vivid colors, expressive brush
strokesUnless she wants me to be looking at that. She knows I'm home. She
knows I can see her. What kind of game is she playing? I think maybe someone's lonely
tonight. Oh-ho, Dr. Geller! Stop it! You're being silly! Or, am I?
Rachel| (singing) Love to love ya baby! Ow! Love to love ya baby! Ow!
(There's a knock on the door, she turns off the music, puts on her robe, and goes to
answer the door.) Love to love ya, baby! (There's another knock.) Darnit! (Looks
through the peephole and turns on the lights.) Ugh. (She opens the door to Ross who's
leaning against the door jam.)
Ross| Hey.
[Scene| Monica and Rachel's, the scene is continued from where we left off before the
break.]
Ross| May I come in?
Rachel| Uh, yeah, if you want too.
Ross| Do you want me too?
Rachel| Yeah, sure?
Ross| So do I. (Slowly walks in.) Okay Rach, before anything happens (He takes
off his coat) I just want to lay down a couple of ground rules. (Turns back to face her.)
This is just about tonight. I don't to go through with this if it's going to raise the
question of "Us." (Rachel's confused) Okay? I just want this to be (Kicks off
his left shoe) about what it is! (Kicks off the other one.)
Rachel| And um, what-what is that Ross?
Ross| The physical act of love. (Hisses at her.)
Rachel| (laughs) What?! Are you crazy?
Ross| Oh so-so you weren't trying to entice me just now with your-your
nakedness?
Rachel| (gasps) Oh God, you saw me?! Oh!
Ross| You weren't trying to entice me with your nakedness.
Rachel| Noo!! No! You thought, you actually thought I wanted to have sex with
you?!
Ross| No! No! (Grabs his coat) No! (Grabs a shoe.) No-no-no-no. (Grabs the other
one and heads for the door.)
Rachel| Ohh wow! Im sorry, but Ross you kicked off your shoes!
Ross| Can we, can we just forget this ever happened?
Rachel| Yes of course, absolutely! You're right. I'm sorry.
Ross| Thank you.
Rachel| Yes.
Ross| All right I guess I'm, gonna go pack. (Starts to leave)
Rachel| Okay. Oh wait! One more thing umm, do-do we still need to uh settle the
question of "us?"
[Scene| Las Vegas, we have the typical glamour shots of Vegas, the Strip, slot
machines, a couple other gaming tables all set to the tune of you guessed it, Money.
Anyhoo, we finally get through that and watch Chandler, Monica, and Phoebe enter Caesar's
Palace carrying their luggage.]
Phoebe| Hey you guys wait! Guys! (Catches up to them.) This place is so much
better than London! Okay? This lady dressed like Cleopatra gave me a coupon, 99 cent steak
and lobster dinner. Huh!
Monica| Phoebe, you don't eat animals.
Phoebe| For 99 cents, I'd eat you. (Sees the casino) Okay, I can totally settle
down here. It's got everything I could ever want, including Joey! Look! (Points to Joey in
his gladiator suit posing for a picture with two old ladies.) Oh! Look! Hi!
Chandler| Oh my God.
Phoebe| Hey! Joey! (They all head over to him, he spots them coming and panics.)
Hey! Hey!! Wow! (She hugs him.)
Joey| Hi!
Chandler| Love your condoms my man.
Joey| What-what are you guys doing here? I thought I told you not to come.
Phoebe| Why are you dressed as a gladiator?
Joey| Uhh, because I'm shooting a scene right now. Yeah, I uh, I play a
gladiator. Uh, y'know what? Hold-hold on a second. (To no one in particular) Can we cut?
Yeah, my-my friends are here, I'm gonna take a little break.
Monica| Who are you talking too?
Joey| They uh director. Uhh, her. (Points to an old woman standing behind him.
Who glares at him and walks off.) All right, all right, it's not a gladiator movie. I work
here.
Chandler| Why?! What happened?!
Joey| Well, the movie got shutdown because they ran out of money, so I'm working
here 'til it starts up again, if it ever does.
Monica| I'm so sorry.
Joey| Look, I'm sorry I didn't tell ya. (To Chandler) I'm sorry man.
Chandler| No-no, that's okay, apparently there's a new policy where we don't
have to share everything with everybody.
Monica| I knew you were not okay with that.
Phoebe| So you're a gladiator! Wow!
Joey| Yeah, what-what's going on?
Phoebe| Monica had lunch with Richard.
Joey| Dawson?!
Phoebe| Noo! But that would've been so cool!
Chandler| No! Her boyfriend Richard!
Monica| It meant nothing! Okay? After all this time, how can you not
trust me?
Chandler| When you go lunching with hunky moustache men and don't tell me about
it!
Monica| You're right. I'm sorry. I should've told you.
Chandler| Thanks. (They hug.)
Joey| Aww, there we go.
Phoebe| I love Vegas!
Monica| I promise you, next time I will absolutely tell you.
Chandler| (pushing her away from another hug) Next time?
Joey| Ooh, so close.
Chandler| There's not gonna be a next time! You can not ever see him again!
Monica| I can not see him? I mean, you can't tell me what to do!
Chandler| That's so funny, because I think I just did!
Monica| Oh y'know what? If you're gonna be acting like this all night, I really,
I don't even want to be around you.
Chandler| Fine with me!
Monica| Fine! Happy Anniversary!
Joey| Whoa! Whoa! Guys! Please! Come on! Come on! This is obviously just a big
misunderstanding.
Monica| No it is not!
Chandler| What are you talking
Joey| Hey-hey don't look at me! I just work here! (Walks away.)
[Scene| An aircraft cabin, Ross and Rachel are on their way to Vegas.]
Rachel| (taking off her sweater) Okay umm, Ross? I'm-I'm really warm, so I'm
going to be taking off my sweater. Now, I'm just letting you know that this is not
an invitation to the physical act of love.
Ross| (sarcastic) Yep! That's hilarious!
Rachel| I'm sorry. I'm done. I'm done.
Ross| Y'know, last night was embarrassing for you too.
Rachel| No, not really. I mean you've seen me naked hundreds of times.
Ross| Uh-huh. But it was a first for the rest of my building.
Rachel| Okay. All right, that's true! But y'know I just don't embarrass that
easily.
Ross| What?! You totally get embarrassed!
Rachel| No, I don't! Ross, I think I'm just a more secure person than you are.
Ross| Is that so?
Rachel| Yeah.
Ross| (loudly so that everyone can hear) Hey lady! I don't care how much you
want it! Okay?! I am not gonna to have sex with you in the bathroom! (Rachel
sinks lower on her chair trying to hide.)
[Scene| Chandler's hotel room, he's sitting there with Joey who's talking about his
helmet and running his hand through that feathery thing at the top.]
Joey| Hey, y'know in Roman times this was more than just a hat.
Chandler| Really?
Joey| Yeah, sure! Sure! They would uh, they would scrub the floors with it! They
would use it to get the mud off their shoe. And sometimes underneath the horse would get
dirty so they would stick it right
Chandler| (interrupting in the nick of time) Joey, I uh! I can't believe
this is how I'm spending my anniversary.
Joey| All right well, I'll take you someplace nice then. Look! A guy tipped me a
hundred bucks today.
Chandler| Whoa!
Joey| Yeah-yeah, he was playing blackjack for like an hour and he won $5,000.
Can you believe that? $5,000!
Chandler| Y'know, if I won $5,000 I'd join a gym, y'know build up my upper body
and hit Richard from behind with a stick! (Mimics it.)
Joey| Wait a minute! Why don't I do what that guy did? I'll take this $100 and
turn it into $5,000! And then I'll turn that into enough money to get my movie
going again!
Chandler| Good luck!
Joey| Chandler! I don't need luck. I have thought this through!
Chandler| I see.
[Scene| The casino bar, Phoebe and Monica are sitting at the bar, while Wayne Newton's
signature song Danke Schoen is playing in the background.]
Monica| (to the bartender) Thank you.
Phoebe| Thanks.
Monica| I can't believe this! This is like the worst night ever!
Phoebe| Y'know Monica you had a minor setback in your relationship with
Chandler. Big deal! It's only Chandler. (Monica turns and stares at her.) I am so
sorry.
Monica| This is crazy! I mean, it's such a stupid argument. I don't even wanna
see Richard again.
Phoebe| So go fix it! Go find Chandler! He's probably up in your room! Tell him
that you're sorry and that you love him.
Monica| Y'know what? You're right Phoebe. You're right. Thank you! (Gets up to
find Chandler.)
Phoebe| Sure! (When Monica gets close to the door.) (Yelling) Yeah! Las Vegas,
number one!
Monica| Anybody lose this? (Holds up the chip and the woman next to her shakes
her head no.)
The Croupier| Comin' out. Place your bet. (Monica does so.) Dice are out. (The
woman next to Monica rolls the dice.) Double or nothin'! Pay the front line! (Monica won
and doubled the chip.)
Monica| Hmm.
[Scene| An airplane cabin, Ross and Rachel are both reading as a guy stops by their
row.]
Guy| (To Rachel) So uh, I'm on my way back to the bathroom. (Ross
giggles.)
Rachel| Yeah, all right. All right! Just keep walkin'! All right?
Rachel| Ross! What are you I'm sorry sir. I just, I think he just really
likes you.
Ross| (to the guy in the window seat next to him) Hey! Y'know that teacher who
had a baby with her student? (He points at Rachel.)
Ross| What the? What
Rachel| (to the flight attendant who appears in record time. It was only seconds
after Rachel pushed the call button was she there. Once again, more proof that TV isn't
real, IRL she would've been waiting for the rest of the flight and by then Ross's pants
would be dry.) Hi!
The Flight Attendant| Miss? May I help you?
Rachel| Yes, I'm sorry. Do you have any extra pants? Umm, my friend seems to
have had a little accident.
[Scene| Caesar's Palace Casino, Joey is approaching one of the blackjack tables
on his quest to make enough money for his movie.]
Joey| (to the dealer) Can I change a hundred? (He hands him his chip.)
Blackjack Dealer| Changing one hundred! (Gives him the change.) Good luck sir.
Joey| (betting all 100) Let's ride.
Blackjack Dealer| (Deals the cards) 13.
Joey| Hit me! (He does so.) Ohh man! (Joey busts and loses all the money, but
when the dealer starts to collect the cards Joey notices something.) Wait! (He holds his
hand next to the dealer's hand.)
Joey| Chandler! You are not gonna believe this! I have found my identical
hand twin!
Chandler| (totally confused) What?
Joey| My identical hand twin!
Chandler| What's an identical hand twin?
Joey| What's it sound like? It's a guy with my identical hands! It was
incredible! Chandler, the dealer's hands were exactly like me! It-it was like looking at
my hands in a mirror!
Chandler| Are you sure you weren't (pause) looking at your hands in a mirror?
Joey| Dont you see what this means?! I can forget about that stupid movie.
I'm gonna be a millionaire!
Chandler| (totally confused) How?
Joey| Look, I don't have it all worked out yet, but it's gotta mean big money!
Come on! Identical hands!
Chandler| Again I must go back to, how?
Joey| This is Vegas man! People will pay to see freaky stuff! Okay, how much
would you pay to see this hand (Holds up his left hand) twice? Huh?
Chandler| (Pause) Y'know, I-I can't really put a price on that Joe.
Joey| Hey, are you unsupporting me again?
Chandler| No! No! I support you 100%! I just didn't, I didn't get it right away.
Y'know now I'm caught up! Identical hand twins! It's a million-dollar idea!
Phoebe| Hey!
Joey| Pheebs!!
Phoebe| Yeah?
Joey| I found my identical hand twin!
Phoebe| Ohh, you are so lucky! (To Chandler) Hey! So, where's Monica? Did
you guys make up?
Chandler| No!
Phoebe| But she just came up here!
Chandler| That was Joey!
Phoebe| I wonder where she is. That is so weird.
Chandler| Yeah, well, she's probably talking to Richard.
Phoebe| Would you stop that! Do you wanna know the first thing she said when she
came back from her lunch with Richard? She didn't feel anything for him. She loves you!
Chandler| Really?
Phoebe| Yes! Now, she feels terrible! She really wants to make up! You gotta
find her.
Chandler| Okay. (He gets up and goes to find her.)
Phoebe| Good. (After he leaves, she puts on Joey's gladiator helmet and checks
herself out in the mirror) I should really start wearing hats!
[Scene| Caesar's Palace Casino, Chandler is looking for Monica while Tom Jones's
signature song is playing in the background (Getting the theme yet? Tom Jones, Wayne
Newton, casinos They're in Vegas people! Catch up!) It's Not Unusual, y'know,
"It's not unusual to be loved by anyone! It's not unusual to have fun with anyone!
  But when I see you hanging about with anyone, it's not unusual to see me cry!
  I wanna die." Well, while that's playing he spots Monica playing craps and
in victory hug the guy next to her. Chandler turns and walks out.]
[Scene| That same plane cabin, Ross is working on a crossword puzzle and Rachel is
asleep against his shoulder. She shifts a little bit and Ross suddenly gets an idea. An
evil idea when he looks at his pen. Then we have a little time lapse, the plane has landed
and everyone is disembarking. The flight attendant is saying bye-bye to everyone.]
The Flight Attendant| (to another passenger) Welcome to Las
Vegas.
The Flight Attendant| (To Rachel) Thank you! (Not sure of
herself) Enjoy your flight?
Rachel| Yes, I did. Thank you very much, it was excellent. (Disembarks)
The Flight Attendant| (To Ross) Hope you had a nice flight.
Ross| Ohh, it was the best!
[Scene| The casino, Ross and Rachel are entering.]
Ross| I think the check in is that way. (Points)
Rachel| Ahh.
Rachel| Hello! (She makes a face and the kid laughs harder. Finally, his parents
drag him off.) Ohh, kids love me.
Phoebe| (sees Ross and Rachel) Hey!
Ross| Phoebe! (They hug.)
Phoebe| You guys are here! Yay!
Rachel| Hi! (Hugs Phoebe)
Phoebe| (sees Rachel's face) What? Did you go to a costume party? Let me guess
umm Pancho Vila? (Points at Rachel) and you're Bob Saget. (An old lady has sat down at the
slot machine Phoebe was just at.)
Rachel| Pancho Vila?
Phoebe| Yeah! (Motions to her face, indicating all of Rachel's
"make-up.")
Rachel| What are you talking about Pheebs? (Takes out her compact) I don't
(She gasps when she looks in the mirror and sees her face.) (To Ross) Oh my God, you drew
on me?!
Ross| Hey, you wet my pants!
Phoebe| Whoa, what kind of party was this?
Rachel| Ross, I have been walking around like this since the plane! I
canyou have so crossed a line. (Heads for the bathroom)
Ross| Rach! Wait! The men's room is that way. (Points in the other direction.
Rachel hits him with her purse and heads for the ladies room.)
Phoebe| Ugh!
Ross| What?
Phoebe| That's like the third time that lady's won on a machine I was playing.
Ross| Oooohhh, I'll bet she's one of those people.
Phoebe| M-M-Mole people?
Ross| What? No-no, a lurker.
Phoebe| Oh. What's a lurker?
Ross| Okay when you're playing a machine and it hasn't paid out, a lurker waits
for you to give up and then
Phoebe| Kills you?
Ross| No. They swoop in and steal your jackpot.
Phoebe| Ohhh!
Ross| Uh-hmm.
Phoebe| How do you know about this?
Ross| My nana used to do it. That's how she paid for all my dancekarate
lessons.
Phoebe| Dance karate?
Ross| Yes, it's a deadly but beautiful sport. (Does a karate chop, then does a
little dance-type sway.)
Rachel| (returning with her purse covering her face) All right, it won't
come off!
Ross| What?!
Rachel| It won't come off!
Ross| Oh my God! Rach-Rach, are-are-are you sure?
Rachel| No, actually I took it off then I drew it back on.
Joey| (entering) Hey-hey-hey you made it!
Ross| Joey!!
Joey| All right! Hey-hey!
Rachel| Hi!!
Joey| Who's your friend? He's hot! (Ross laughs and Rachel smacks him with her
purse.)
Ross| (To Joey) Thanks man.
Rachel| Hi. (She hugs Joey.)
Ross| Hey listen I uh, talked to Chandler, sorry about the movie.
Joey| No, don't be sorry. I don't need it anymore. I found my identical hand
twin!
Ross| Your what?
Joey| My identical hand twin! The person whose hands are exactly like mine! This
thing is a gold mine!
Ross| What?! That's not gonna make you any money!
Joey| Okay. Well, if that's how you feel about it, fine! None of you get to live
with me in my great big hand-shaped mansion! Except uh, you Pheebs. You can live in the
thumb.
[Scene| The craps table, Monica is on a big roll.]
Monica| All right baby, come on! (Rolls the dice) Yes! Yes! I am on fire!
Chandler| (walking by with his luggage) See you later Mon.
Monica| Wait Chandler, what are you doing?!
Chandler| What does it look like? I'm going home.
Monica| What? Wait! Why? (He turns and heads for the door and she chases after
him.) Chandler! Chandler! Wait! Im sorry, I was just playing for one second! I was
trying to find you to tell you that, look if you don't want me to see Richard again, I
won't! He means nothing to me!
Chandler| Come on! I was there! (He's propped up with his hand on a statute of a
naked guy. He winces and pulls his hand away.) I know he's the love of your life.
Monica| Not any more.
Chandler| Really?!
Monica| Really! (They hug and kiss) All right? Let's forget about this going
home stuff and celebrate our anniversary. (She picks up his suitcase.) Okay, this is
empty.
Chandler| Yeah, I wanted to make a dramatic scene, but I hate packing.
[Scene| A blackjack table, it's the same one Joey's hand twin was working at, only he's
not there anymore and has been replaced by a beautiful woman.]
Joey| (entering) Uhh, hey. Where's the other guy?
The Woman Dealer| Which guy?
Joey| He's kinda tall, dark hair, hand looks exactly like this. (Holds up his
hand.) See?
The Woman Dealer| I don't know about the hands, but the guy that was
here before me just went to the bathroom.
Joey| Okay! (Walks away, then turns back.) How you doin'?
The Woman Dealer| Very busy.
Joey| Right! Okay. (Heads for the bathroom.)
[Scene| Ross and Rachel's hotel room, Rachel is still trying to get the ink off and
Ross is on the phone to the company. Wait a minute, why exactly are they sharing a hotel
room? Didn't they like break-up or something? Did I miss a memo? Or maybe, it's just
foreshadowing things to come. Who knows? Maybe the answer's at the bottom of the page.
Then again, maybe it isn't and it's just one of those things TV writers just don't
explain. Anyhoo]
Ross| (on the phone) Yes, hello. I have a question. Umm, I used your pen to draw
on my friend's face. (Listens) A beard and a moustache. (Listens and laughs) Thank you.
(Rachel turns around and glares at him.) No, she didn't think so. (Listens) I know
it's like (turns and sees Rachel staring at him and quickly changes the subject) anyway,
umm well make-up didn't cover it and we've tried everything to get it off and nothing's
worked. What-what do we do? (Listens) Yeah. (Listens) Uh-huh. (Listens) Yeah. (Listens)
Oh! Okay. (Listens) Okay, thank you! (Rachel gets excited at his tone.) (Hangs up the
phone) Yeah, it's not coming off.
Rachel| What?! What else did he say?
Ross| Umm, he said he thought I was funny. So(Rachel stares at him.) Okay,
look-look umm, let's just go downstairs, we'll have some fun, and you will forget all
about it.
Rachel| Ross, no! There is no way I am leaving this room looking like
this!
Ross| Oh, come on! Rach, it's-it's not that bad.
Rachel| Ross, I am a human doodle!!
Ross| Look, just because some idiot drew on your face doesn't mean you shouldn't
have any fun! Okay? And besides, hey-hey-hey no one is even gonna look at you.
Okay? This is Vegas! Hello! There are tons of other freaks here! (Rachel turns around and
glares at him.) There are tonsoffreaks here. No other. No. Come on! No one
will notice, I swear!
Ross| Okay, there was some staring and pointing.
Rachel| Okay, I need a, I need a drink! (Makes a beeline for the mini-bar.)
Ross| Oh, hey y'know, they-they really overcharge you for that stuff. (Rachel
glares at him.) But who cares?! Because it's all on me! (Rachel reaches into the fridge
and pulls out two handfuls of those mini booze bottles.) (Watching her.) That is, one big
drink!
Rachel| (she's finished reliving the fridge of its entire alcohol content.)
Macadamia nut?
Ross| (looking at the price list) Umm Wow! That's-that's some pricey nut!
Rachel| Hm-mmm! (Opens the container)
Ross| Really like those Macadamia nuts, huh?
Rachel| Nope! (She puts one in her mouth and spits it out, then does it again in
another direction.)
[Scene| The casino, Phoebe is playing on a slot machine. Suddenly the lurker sticks her
head around the aisle of slot machines.]
Phoebe| (seeing her) Get out of here you lurker! (She doesn't move) Go on! Get!
(She throws a quarter at her.)
Chandler| (arm-in-arm with Monica) Hey Pheebs!
Phoebe| Ohh! You made up!
Monica| Yeah, I couldn't be mad at him for too long.
Chandler| Yeah, she couldn't live without the Chan Love. (They start kissing.)
Phoebe| Ohh, get a room.
Monica| We have one.
Phoebe| I know. Use it.
[Scene| The Men's room, Joey is entering and sees his hand twin washing his hands.]
Joey| Oh-oh-oh, yeah! (He grabs some towels and takes them to him.) That's
right, you take good care of those babies!
Joey's Hand Twin| Excuse me?
Joey| It's me, Joey!
Joey's Hand Twin| Do I know you?
Joey| (holds up his hand) Joey!
Joey's Hand Twin| Oh-ho, yeah. Yeah, the hand guy.
Joey| Okay, so what are we going to do about this hand twin thing?!
Joey's Hand Twin| Nothing?
Joey| Look, you and I have been given a gift. Okay? We have to do something with
it. Like-like, hand modeling! Huh? Or-or magic! And you know NASA's gonna wanna
talk to us!
Joey's Hand Twin| (tries to leave) I have to get back to
Joey| (stopping him) Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa-whoa! We could have our own show!
Y'know we could clap our hands together people will love it! Huh? And-and-and I wrote a
song for us! (Singing, to the tune of This Land is Your Land) This hand is your
hand! This hand is my hand! Oh wait, that's your hand! No wait, it's my hand!
Joey's Hand Twin| That's okay. (Walks out.)
Joey| (following him) But you haven't even heard the chorus!
[Scene| Ross and Rachel's room, Ross is drinking a beer while Rachel is examining
herself in the mirror.]
Rachel| Oh my God, I'm starting to look like my great aunt, Muriel.
Ross| (gets up) All right. Y'know what? We dont have to go downstairs! We
can bring Vegas up to us! (He grabs a deck of cards and pulls up a chair.) All right, come
on, come on, we'll play some blackjack. Here we go. (Deals the cards.) 13.
Rachel| Hit me!
Ross| (does so) Oohh, 23. (Rachel looks at him.) Which is what we play to at
this casino! You win 10 dollars! (Holds out a ten.)
Rachel| I bet 20.
Ross| You're right! (Gives her the twenty she won.)
[Scene| The Craps Table, Monica is still on her roll, only this time Chandler's with
her and she has a huge crowd of people around.]
Monica| (shaking the dice) A new pair of shoes for the Chan-Chan man! (Rolls the
dice.) Yes!
Chandler| Yes! I've-I've never seen a roll like this in my life!
Monica| That's right baby! Okay, what do I want now?
Chandler| Okay, ah umm, ah, a 8. Ah, a 6?
Monica| Pick a number! That is your only job!
Chandler| 8. 8!
Monica| Thank you!
Chandler| If you get this one, we buy everybody here a steak dinner!
All| Yay!!
The Croupier| 8!
Monica| Yes!
All| Yay!!
Monica| (To Chandler) We're not really gonna buy these people steak dinners are
we?
Chandler| Noo!
Monica| Okay, good! Okay, what do I want now?
Chandler| Ahh, ooh, try a hard 8.
Monica| What?
Chandler| Two fours.
Monica| Okay. (Rolls the dice)
A Drunken Gambler| (To Chandler) Don't you let her go! You're a lucky guy!
Chandler| Thank you, Mister Drunken Gambler! Okay, you get this and uh, we get
the biggest suite in the place! (Everyone cheers) Wait-wait-wait-wait! We (motions
to Monica and him.) get the biggest suite in the place.
Monica| All right, biggest suite in the place. Come on! (Rolls the dice.)
Chandler| (sees the roll) Yes!! I love you! I can't even remember what we were
fighting about!
Monica| Oh, that's because I had lunch with RichMe neither! Okay, what do
I want now?
Chandler| Another hard 8.
Monica| Hard 8?! We should call it easy 8!
Chandler| Okay, okay, I tell you what. You roll another hard eight; (pause) and
we get married here tonight.
Drunken Gambler| Go! Come on! Roll!
All| Roll-roll!!
Monica| Shut up!! It just got interesting!
[Scene| The Craps table, continued from earlier.]
Monica| What did you just say?
Chandler| You roll another hard eight and we get married here tonight.
Monica| Are you serious?!
Chandler| Yes! I love you! I've never loved anybody as much as I love you.
Monica| I've never loved anybody as much as I love you.
Chandler| Okay, so if an eight comes up, we take it as a sign and we do it!
{Whoa! Where have I heard that before? Matthew Perry talking about signs in Las Vegas. I
guess it must've been some movie I saw.} What do you say?
Monica| Okay!
Chandler| Okay! Come on! Let's go! All right!
Chandler| (spots one) Okay! That's a four! And where-where's the other one?
Drunken Gambler| It went under the table.
Monica| Nobody move! (To Chandler) Okay, you look that way; I'll look this way!
Chandler| All right!
Chandler| Here it is! Here it is!
Monica| That could be a four or a five. It's your call.
Chandler| It's a four.
Monica| I think so too.
[Scene| The slot machines, Phoebe is still feeding quarters into the one-armed bandit
as the lurker peeks over the top of the machines.]
Phoebe| Oh well, lost again. (She gets up and slowly moves away. The lurker
scurries in and takes her spot, only this time Phoebe set a trap for her and catches her
in the act.) That's it! You and me, outside!
The Lurker| I don't want to see you lose a chunk of that pretty blond
hair!
Phoebe| Be cool! (They both pretend to have a nice conversation as the guard
walks by, but after he leaves they both start fighting again.) Okay lady, your lurking
days are over!
The Lurker| What?!
Phoebe| Yeah, from now on everyone you lurk, I'm gonna lurk first! You move on
to someone else, I'm gonna be one step ahead of you, every single time! And then I'll be
on your ass every hour of every day 'til Monday, because that's when I go home. When do
you leave?
The Lurker| Also Monday.
Phoebe| What time? Maybe we can share a cab!
[Scene| Ross and Rachel's room, they've pretty much consumed the entire mini-bar.
Needless to say, they're feeling no pain and are still playing blackjack.]
Rachel| Hit me. (He does so.) Hit me. (He does so.) Hit me. (He does so.) Hit
me. (He does so.) Hit me. (He does so.) Hit me. (He does so.) Hit me. (She slows down with
each one.)
Ross| (runs out of cards) We need more cards.
Rachel| Yeah, and also we need more umm, drinks. Hold on a second. (Gets up but
stumbles a little bit.) Whup, okay. (She makes it to the phone and picks it up, without
dialing.) Hello! Vegas? Yeah, we would like some more alcohol, and y'know what else? We
would like some more beers. Hello? Ohh, I forgot to dial!
Ross| That must be our alcohol and beers! (Gets up to answer it.)
Joey| Hey!
Ross| Ohh, it's Joey! I love Joey! (Hugs him.)
Rachel| Ohh, I love Joey! Joey lives with a duck! (Goes and hugs Joey.)
Joey| Hi!
Rachel| Hey!
Joey| Look-look-look you guys, I need some help! Okay? Someone is going to have
to convince my hand twin to cooperate!
Ross| I'll do it. Hey, whatever you need me to do, I'm your man. (He starts to
sit down on the bed. There's one problem though, he's about two feet to the left of it.
Needless to say, he misses and falls on his butt.) (Looking up at Joey.) Whoa-oh-whoa! Are
you, are you okay?
Joey| Yeah! I'm fine! Thanks! (He starts to leave, but gets an idea and stops.)
Hey Rach, how you doin'?
Rachel| I'm doin' good, baby. How you doin'?
Joey| Ross, don't let her drink anymore! (Exits)
Ross| Ohh, here's that Macadamia nut!
Rachel| Ohhh!!
Ross| (he puts it in his mouth) Nope! Something else. (Throws it back under the
bed.)
Rachel| Oops! All right, so what do you want to do now?
Ross| I wanna get out of the room! Y'know, II really miss downstairs.
Rachel| Okay, y'know what? There's only one way I'm leaving this hotel room.
Ross| Well hello! I'm Ross!
Rachel| Good luck to ya!
Ross| Excuse me sir, you've got a little something right here. (He points to the
corner of his mouth and they both laugh.)
Rachel| Wow!
Ross| (bowing) Hello!
Rachel| (bowing) Hello!
Ross and Rachel|
[Scene| The slot machines, we see some guy not having any luck. Both Phoebe and the
Lurker are lurking him and each stick their heads around the corner at different times
This is all set to that Pink Panther song. Finally the guy gives up and walks past
the lurker's position, thus giving her the advantage. She scurries in and quickly drops a
coin in the slot before Phoebe gets there. Phoebe arrives slightly later and pulls the arm
just after the lurker deposits the coin and wins.]
Phoebe| I won! I won! I finally won!
The Lurker| I won! That was my quarter!
Phoebe| Fine! Here! Take a hike toots! (Gives back her quarter.)
The Lurker| (to the guard) Excuse me, sir! This lady played my quarter,
this is my money. (Motions to the jackpot.)
The Security Guard| (To Phoebe) Is that true miss?
Phoebe| (quietly) Sells drugs to kids.
The Security Guard| What?!
Phoebe| She sells drugs to kids. (The guard looks at the lurker.)
The Lurker| It was my quarter!
The Security Guard| (To Phoebe) Was it her quarter?
Phoebe| How about we talk about this over dinner?
The Security Guard| Okay lady, you're out of here.
Phoebe| No! No, you can't arrest me! No!! I won't go back! I won't go back to
that hell hole!!
The Security Guard| I'm just taking you outside!
Phoebe| Oh, okay. (Walks out.)
[Scene| The Gift Shop, Monica and Chandler are entering.]
Monica| Okay, come on, I can't get married until I get something old, something
new, something borrowed, and something blue.
Chandler| Okay, all right, all right, all right! Okay! (Picks up a blue
sweater.) Okay, here's something, here's something blue and new.
Monica| You're so efficient. I love you!
Chandler| Let's go! (Starts to leave.)
Monica| No-no-no! We need something old!
Chandler| Ohh, great, I have condom in my wallet I've had since I was twelve.
Monica| That'll work!
Chandler| I don't think so.
Monica| Okay, now we just need something borrowed!
Chandler| (looks around) Here justtake this. (Hands her the sweater.)
Monica| That's stealing!
Chandler| No, we'll-we'll bring it back! Just put it under your dress.
Monica| Ohh. (Rubs her fake stomach.)
Chandler| Okay, one thing at a time. (They run out to get married.)
[Scene| A blackjack table, Joey is moving in to try and get his hand twin (who's
dealing) to join him in his evil plot to rule the world! "Join me, and together we'll
rule the universe as father and son!" (Sorry, I had a little Star Wars creep
in thereOoh, I have a big spoiler for The Phantom Menace, Yoda lives at the
end! Ha-ha, spoiled it! Now you don't have to see it!)]
Joey| (sitting down) Ahhh! (Slides his hands across the table.)
Joey's Hand Twin| Are you gonna play?
Joey| No-no, I don't really have any money. Not yet, anyway (Shakes his
hands.)
Joey's Hand Twin| You can't sit here if you're not gonna play.
Joey| (throws down a small wad of money, and as his hand twin starts to unfold
it, Joey once again brings attention to their special gift to the world. {Y'know, looking
at it now, they really don't have that similar of hands. Joey's are bigger.}) Ooh-ho-ho!
(The dealer stares at him and he stops.)
Phoebe| (entering and sitting down at the table.) Hello. My name is Regina
Phalange. I'm a businesswoman in town on business. Would you like to see my card? (Looks
down) Ooh, what did I do with my file-a-facts? I must've left it in conference room B.
Joey's Hand Twin| (To Joey) 14.
Joey| Hit me! (He does so.)
Phoebe| Oh my God! May I just say that you two gentlemen have the exact same
hands! They're identical! Now, I've never seen anything like that in the business world.
Joey's Hand Twin| Stop it!
Joey| Uhh, Ms. Phalange, may I ask you a question as an impartial person at-at
this table?
Joey's Hand Twin| Please stop it!
Joey| Wouldn't you pay good money to see these identical hands showcased in some
type of a uh, entertainment venue?
Joey's Hand Twin| (To Joey) If you leave now, I will chop off my hand and give
it too you!
The Security Guard| (To Phoebe) Didn't I just throw you out of here?
Phoebe| No, you threw out Phoebe. I'm Ms. Regina Phalange. Phalange!
The Security Guard| Come on, lady! (Starts to escort her out.)
Joey's Hand Twin| Please, please take him too. (Motions to Joey.)
Joey| Me?! Oh come on, man! You can't do this! Come on! (Being dragged out by
the guard) I'm your hand twin!!
[Scene| A Little White Chapel, Chandler and Monica are entering.]
Chandler| Hello! One marriage please!
Monica| Yep, we wanna get married!
The Attendant| Well, there's a service in progress. Have a seat.
Chandler and Monica|
Chandler| (singing) Dum! Dum-dum-dum! Dum! Dum! Dum! Dum-dum-dum!
Monica| What are you doing?
Chandler| Oh, that's The Wedding March. Does, does that freak you out?
Monica| No, only because that's the graduation song.
Chandler| Okay! (Stands up) This is it! (Claps his hands) We're gonna get
married!
Monica| Are you sure you wanna do this?
Ross| Well, hello, Mrs. Ross! (Throws some rice.)
Rachel| Well, hello, Mr. Rachel! (Throws some more rice.)
Rachel| Wait! (Gets her bearings) Okay!
