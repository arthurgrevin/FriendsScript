[Scene  The Wedding Chapel, continued from last season. Chandler and Monica are about
to get married.]
Chandler 
Monica 
Ross 
Rachel 
Rachel 
Monica  Whoa!
Chandler  Oh my God!
Joey  (entering with Phoebe) Come on Pheebs! Hurry! Hurry! Hurry! Hurry!
Phoebe  Okay! Okay! Okay! (They run into the chapel.)
Chandler  Oh my God!! Is everybody getting married?!!
Attendant  (scolding them) N-No running in the chapel!
Phoebe  (to her) Hey! Dont you give me any of yourHey! (Sees
Chandler and Monica standing there.)
Chandler  Hey!
Joey  Hey!
Monica  What are you guys doing here?
Joey  Ross and Rachel left us a message saying they were getting married!
Isnt that why you guys are here?
Chandler  Yes! Well that-yes.
Monica  Why else would we be here?
Joey  Well! What happened?! Did we miss it?
Chandler  We actually missed it.
Phoebe  Well, maybe you wouldnt have had you (turns to the attendant) run
in the chapel!
Monica  This is insane!
Phoebe  Whats the big deal, yknow? Its not like its a
real marriage.
Chandler  What?!
Phoebe  Yeah, if you get married in Vegas, youre only married in Vegas.
Monica  What are you talking about? If you get married in Vegas youre
married everywhere.
Phoebe  (shocked) Really?!
Monica  Yeah!
Phoebe  Oh my God!Eh! Well
{Transcibers note  In case you havent heard, Courteney Cox got married to
David Arquette during hiatus and changed her name to Courteney Cox Arquette. But David was
a busy boy during the off season for not only did he marry but everyone else as well. For
theyre all listed as Jennifer Aniston Arquette, Lisa Kudrow Arquette, in an
interesting twist Matt LeBlanc Arquette, Matthew Perry Arquette, David Schwimmer Arquette,
and even the creators of the show are now David Crane Arquette and Marta Kauffman
Arquette. I just wonder what the new sleeping arrangements are}
[Scene  Rachels hotel room, shes waking up with a horrendous hangover.]
Rachel  Ohhh! (Looks in the mirror and sees that she still has her mustache and
groans.)
Ross  Why are we in bed together?
Rachel  I dont know. Do-do you have any clothes on?
Ross  (checks) Yeah.
Rachel  Really?!
Ross  No! But we-we didnt havesex-uh, did we? I mean, I dont
remember much about last night, it was such a blur.
Rachel  Oh! I remember laughing! I laughed a lot.
Ross  And we didnt have sex.
Rachel  Ohh, I mean, we were really drunk. Im just glad we didnt do
anything stupid.
Ross  (getting up) Tell me about it. (He sits up on the edge of the bed and has
"Just Married" written on his back.)
[Scene  The breakfast buffet, Phoebe is already sitting at the table as Joey enters.]
Joey  Mornin Pheebs. (Sits down.) Well, my movie has officially been
canceled.
Phoebe  Oh Joey, Im so sorry. You want some of my breakfast?
Joey  Nah, Im too depressed to eat. Ill probably eat in like 5
minutes. So I guess Ill just fly home with you guys, what times your flight?
Phoebe  What about my cab?
Joey  I dont need that anymore.
Phoebe  No, Joey! You borrowed my cab; you have to drive it back.
Joey  I dont want to drive all the way back by myself, I get so lonely.
(Gets an idea.) Ohooh! How about you come with me?
Phoebe  I dont know, its such a long trip.
Joey  Itll be great! We-we could talk, and play games! Huh? This could be
our chance to like renew our friendship.
Phoebe  Are you asking me to have a frenaissance?
Joey  Sure?
Phoebe  All right. Although I dont think we need one, I never stopped
loving you.
Chandler  Hi!
Joey  Hey.
Monica  Hey.
Chandler  So, has anyone talked to Dr. and Mrs. Geller yet?
Phoebe  Um-hmm, yeah. They left me a message; they should be here any minute.
Joey  Where is the waitress?! Im starving!
Chandler  Its a buffet man.
Joey  Oh, heres where I win all my money back! (Gets up and heads for the
buffet table with Chandler in tow.)
Chandler  Listen, I gotta talk to you.
Joey  Sure! Whats up? (He grabs a plate and proceeds to load it with a
huge pile of scrambled eggs. Chandler just stares at him and Joey reluctantly gives him a
spoonful.)
Chandler  Monica and I almost got married last night.
Joey  Oh my God! Thats huge! (Hugs him.) Wait a minute, why come I
wasnt invited? And who was going to be your best man? Dont say,
"Ross." Do not say, "Ross."
Chandler  Look, I just dont think Monica and I are ready to get married
yet! Yknow? I mean, I love her and everything but seeing Ross and Rachel coming out
of that chapel was like a, like a wake-up call that Monica and I are moving so fast.
Yknow? And, how do I tell her without crushing her?
Joey  Oh! Tell her shes not marriage material.
Chandler  What?!
Joey  Girls say it to me all the time! And believe me, if shes anything
like me, shes just gonna be relieved.
Monica  How do I tell Chandler that its too soon. Its gonna break
his heart, hes not gonna think that I dont love him anymore.
Phoebe  Well you dont.
Monica  Yes I do!
Phoebe  Good! Good! I was just testing you.
Chandler  (returning with Joey) Hi.
Monica  Oh hi! Hi! Yknow, we were just talking about bacon.
Phoebe  No, we were talking about tennis. Tennis is more believable.
Ross  Hey!
The Girls 
Chandler  Hey!
Ross  What?
Chandler  Are we gonna talk about what you guys did last night? Or
Rachel  (To Ross) I dont know. (To the gang.) What do you mean last night?
Nothing, nothing uh, happened last night.
Ross  Yeah!
Phoebe  Uh-huh! Ross invited us all to watch.
Monica  Rach! We werent gonna miss our friends getting married!
Rachel  (gasps) Who got married?! (Ross is as surprised to hear this as she is.)
Chandler  (not quite sure) You did.
Ross  What?! Hello! We didnt get married.
Rachel  No, we didnt get married! Thats ridiculous!
Ross  We-we-weI remember being in a chapel.
Rachel  Oh my God.
Ross  IThey would not let us get married when we were that drunk!
Rachel  No!
Joey  They let you get married when youre drunk! Most people who get
married in Vegas are drunk!
Phoebe  Hell, Im drunk right now! (They all turn and look at her.) What? I
cant have a mimosa with breakfast?! Im on vacation!
Monica  What are you guys gonna do?
Rachel  Well, I guess we just find a divorce lawyer? (Looks at Ross.)
Chandler  Well, I think, I think, Ross already has one. Now, this ones
free, right? Because you paid for the first two, so the third ones free.
Ross  Laugh it up, but the jokes on you. Because we dont need to get
divorced, okay? We were just gonna get an annulment.
Joey  An annulment? Ross! I dont think surgerys the answer here.
Phoebe  Oh-oh, thats your thing.
Ross  What?
Phoebe  Youre thing. Youre thing. Yknow? Youre the guy
who gets divorced.
All  Oh yeah!
Ross  No-no, thats-thats not my thing! I do not love getting
divorced!
Phoebe  Yes you do! This is your third divorce! You love divorce so much
youre probably gonna marry it! Then it wont work out and youre gonna
have to divorce it, divorcing guy. (Pause) Im so drunk.
[Scene  The casino floor, Chandler and Monica are walking through it.]
Monica  So, what do you think we should do?
Chandler  I dont know. But I-I-I know I love you!
Monica  I know I love you! (They hug.)
Chandler  So where are we on the whole going back to the place where they have
all the marriages thing? I love you.
Monica  Thats a good question. Look umm, last night we let the dice
decide. Maybe we should leave it up to fate again. I love you!
Chandler  Yes, we dont get married unless theres a sign! Okay, so
say uh, say you roll another eight (motions to the craps table) then theres a definite
sign that we should get married.
Monica  All right, eight we get married, but 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12 we
dont get married.
Chandler  Sounds great.
Monica  Okay. (They approach the craps table.)
Croupler  Coming in, we got a shooter! Money please.
Monica  Ready?
Chandler  Ready!
Monica  (sarcastic) Come on eight.
Chandler  (deadpan) Yes, yes eight.
Croupler  Eight! Easy eight. (She rolls a 3 and a 5 and theyre stunned.)
Monica  Wow! I cant believe I actually rolled an eight.
Chandler  That was so unlikely. Well, lets get married! I guess.
Monica  Wait a minute. That wasnt a hard eight! Last night I rolled a hard
eight.
Chandler  Thats right! It was the wrong kind of eight, no wedding! Damnit!
Monica  I wanted it so bad! (Pause) Wanna go pack?
Chandler  Yeah. (They go pack.) Were doing the right thing, right?
Monica  Ohh, of course we are! (They walk up to the elevators.) We left it up to
fate. (Pushes the elevator button.) If we were supposed to get married there would be a
clear-cut sign. (The elevator door opens to a priest reading from a bible with Chandler
and Monica standing side-by-side holding each others hands.)
[Scene  Phoebes cab, Phoebe and Joey are driving back. Phoebe is driving while
Joey is sleeping.]
Phoebe  Okay, you have 19 questions left. Use them wisely. (Joey groans.) Come
on Joey! You cant win if you dont ask any (sees that hes asleep) QUESTIONS!!!
Joey  (wakes up) What?!
Phoebe  Well, you promised me a fun road trip! Weve been on the road six
hours and youve been asleep for five and a half! We are switching at the next rest
stop and you are going to drive all the way back! That will be your punishment, you
greedy sleeper!
Joey  All right. All right.
Phoebe  Yeah! And until then you are going to sing to me because the
radios broken and you are selfish but have a nice voice.
Joey  Really? I dont
Phoebe  Sing!!
Joey  (starts singing) I wanna rock and roll all night! (Falls asleep.)
Joey  (to himself) Man, this is a long drive! Are my eyes open? No! (He opens
his eyes and sees a hitchhiker.)
Hitchhiker  (driving) Morning! (Phoebe screams again.)
[Scene  Central Perk, Rachel is on the couch as Ross enters.]
Ross  Hey!
Rachel  Hey, hubby!
Ross  Yeah. Yeah, actually um, I wanted to talk to you about that whole
annulment thing?
Rachel  Uh-huh.
Ross  Im not going to do that. (Rachel glares at him.)
[Scene  Central Perk, continued from earlier. Rachel starts laughing.]
Rachel  Okay! So, well just stay married.
Ross  Yes, exactly!
Rachel  And I will make everyone call me Mrs. Geller!
Ross  Wow! This is so amazing. I uh, I really thought Id have to talk you
into this more.
Rachel  Okay, see now Im scared because I dont actually think
youre kidding.
Ross  Im-Im not kidding. Look I-I, I cant have three
failed marriages. I cant. Okay? I-I am not gonna be that guy!
Rachel  What-wh-what so well just stay married forever?!
Ross  Okay, look, how is this gonna affect you? Really? I mean you fill some
form out once and a while and instead of checking the box that says Ms you check the box
that says Mrs.! Its right next to it!
Rachel  Ohh, okay, Im sorry. Youre right. Yknow what? We
absolutely can stay married, because I was under the impression that the boxes were far away
from each other. All right, look, just please, take a moment here and think about what
youre asking of me.
Ross  Im asking you to do me a favor.
{Note  Does anyone else want to smack Ross right about now? Raise your hands. Okay, put
them down before you stink out the person next to you.}
Rachel  You are asking me to be your wife!
Ross  And as my wife I think you should grant me this favor.
[Scene  The hallway, Chandler is helping Monica to the door.]
Monica  That kid really kicked me hard on the plane.
Chandler  Well you did pull his hair.
Monica  He took my snack!
Chandler  Im not getting into this again!
Monica  Okay! Oh God, yknow what? Its really bad.
Chandler   Well, I told you not to walk. Here. (Picks her up.) There. Okay.
(He opens the door, carries her across the threshold, stops, backs out, and lets go of
Monica who is only holding on by his neck.)
Monica  This doesnt mean anything, does it?
Chandler  No!
Monica  Okay.
[Scene  Phoebes cab, shes driving, Joeys in the back seat, and the
hitchhiker is riding up front with Phoebe.]
Phoebe  (To Joey) How could you pick up a hitchhiker?! He could be a
rape(She holds her hand in front of the hitchhikers face), a rapist or a
killer or something!
Joey  Dont you think I asked him that before he got in?!
Phoebe  Yknow what? Im not talking to you! You go back to sleep! (To
the hitchhiker) And you, are you a rapist?!
Hitchhiker  No!
Phoebe  Do you like car games?
Hitchhiker  Yeah, yknow the license plate game?
Phoebe  I love the license plate game!
Joey  Ooh, Ill play! Ill play!
Phoebe  No-No! You need your sleep. Night-night! Shh! (She closes the
partition.)
[Scene  Monica and Rachel's, Ross is entering.]
Ross  Hey!
Rachel  Hey!
Ross  Listen, I know you wanted to talk to me, but I have an idea that may make
you want to stay married. (Rachel shakes her head.) We register, and you get to
keep all the presents!
Rachel  (thinks about it for a second) No! Ross, come on! No! Listen, look I
thought a lot about how to tell you this and the bottom line, Ross, is we can not stay
married.
Ross  I dont know if its true.
Rachel  Oh b-b-but it is!
Ross  Oh, okay, yknow what this is? This is a difference of
opinion. And when that happens in a marriage...
Rachel  Oh Ross, come on! This is not, this is not a marriage!! This is the
worlds worst hangover! Ross, listen, if you do not get this annulment, I
will!
Ross  All right. All right, Ill do it.
Rachel  Thank you. (He goes to leave.) Hey-hey umm, uh, is there, is there any
such thing as an annulment shower?
[Scene  Phoebes cab, its the same arrangement as before.]
Hitchhiker  Wait! Wait! There is the train station!
Phoebe  Oh, okay.
Hitchhiker  This is where I get off. Well, I have your address and phone number.
Phoebe  And I have your name and the fact that youre a drifter, so the
balls pretty much in your court.
Hitchhiker  All right, see ya Pheebs. (Gets out and Phoebe drives away.)
Joey  Come on Pheebs! I cant take this anymore! Let-let me make it up to
you. Huh? (Starts singing.) Ground control to Major Tom. Commencing countdown, engines
on. Take your protein pills and put your helmet on!
Phoebe  Stop it! Stop it no! Thats not fair! Yknow I cant
resist that beautiful voice!
Joey  Pheebs, I am so sorry! I know I promised you a fun road trip with your
friend and I didnt deliver. But-but-but now I know that you think being awake is an
important part of friendship! So, so, so I will strive to-to stay awake for as long as I
know you.
Phoebe  You can still sleep at night and stuff.
Joey  Well, thank you. So, can we play 20 Questions now? Ive got a really
good one! Ive been thinking about it since Kansas.
Phoebe  Okay. Is it a kind of hot sandwich?
Joey  Yes.
Phoebe  Is it a meatball sub?
Joey  That is incredible! You are the master!
[Scene  Monica and Rachel's, Chandler and Monica are there and Rachel is arranging a
bouquet of flowers, pricks her finger on a thorn, throws the bouquet over her head, and
those you who are quicker than some already know that Monica is the one who catches it.]
Rachel  Huh, thats funny. You look like youre gonna be the
Monica  No, dont say it! Dont even think it!
Rachel  All right. Okay Chandler, enjoy your handful. (Exits.)
Chandler  All right, should we just, should we just get married? Yknow? I
mean should we just do it? All the signs are telling us to do it.
Monica  Im sick of the signs! Its too fast, Im happy the way
things are!
Chandler  Me too!
Monica  I dont want things to change! Do you?
Chandler  No!
Monica  All right then, then nothing changes! Everything is great! Everything
stays the same! And you go unpack because its been three days and its driving
me insane!
Chandler  Jeez, relax! Its not like were mar-ah-ah!! (Runs out.)
Chandler  (entering, slowly) Yknow I was thinking, what if I uh, unpack
here?
Monica  Then all your stuff would be here.
Chandler  Well, what if all my stuff was here?
Monica  Then youd be going back and forth all the time, I mean it
doesnt make any sense.
Chandler  Okay. What if we lived together and you understand what Im
saying?
Monica  Live together? There have been no signs for that.
Chandler  Me asking is kind of a sign.
Monica  YES!!!!!!!!
Chandler  Okay!!!!!
Monica  Yes! Okay! Okay! Wait-wait-wait!
Chandler  Okay.
Monica  Heres your key (Gets him one.)
Chandler  Oh thanks.
Monica  Heres your key. All right, you have to christen it! Now, go out
and come back in!
Chandler  The door hasnt been locked in five years, but okay! (Runs out.)
Ready?!
Monica  Ready!
Chandler  Okay, a little problem. The key broke in the lock and I cant get
in!
Monica  Wait! Oh my God! I cant get out!
Chandler  This is not a sign!
Monica  No, its not a sign! Its a very old key!
Chandler  Its an old key!
Monica  Oh my God its old!
Chandler  I love you!
Monica  I love you!
Chandler  Are you hugging the door right now.
Monica  No.
Chandler  Yeah-yeah, me neither.
[Scene  Central Perk, Rachel and Phoebe are on the couch as Ross enters.]
Ross  Hey!
Rachel  Hey, so did everything go all right with the annulment?
Ross  Oh, yeah, no problems. Its all taken care of.
Rachel  Ross, thank you. Hey, do you guys wanna go see a movie?
Ross  Oh yeah, why not?
Rachel  Pheebs?
Phoebe  No thanks, Ive already seen one.
Rachel  Okay, umm, Im gonna get my sweater. (Walks away.)
Ross  Okay. (Sits down next to Phoebe.) You uh, you wanna hear something weird?
Phoebe  Always.
Ross  I didnt get the annulment.
Phoebe  What?!
Ross  Were still married! Dont tell Rachel. See you later. (He gets
up leaving Phoebe in shock.)
[Scene  The hallway, Joey is coming up the stairs and sees Chandler trying to open the
lock.]
Joey  What are you doing?
Chandler  The keys stuck in the lock.
Joey  I can fix it. Hold on. (He goes and gets a screwdriver from his apartment)
Look out. Look out. (Pries at the door a little bit.)
Chandler  (trying the handle) It still doesnt work.
Joey  Im not finished.
Chandler  Oh.
Chandler  Nice job Joe! Youre quite the craftsmen.
[Scene  Central Perk, its the same scene from the end of last weeks show.
Phoebe and Rachel are sitting on the couch as Ross enters.]
Ross  Hey!
Rachel  Hey, so did everything go okay with the annulment?
Ross  Oh, yeah, no problems. Its all taken care of.
Rachel  Ross, thank you. Hey, do you guys wanna go see a movie?
Ross  Oh yeah, why not?
Rachel  Okay, umm, Im gonna get my sweater. (Walks away.)
Ross  Okay. (Sits down next to Phoebe.) You uh, you wanna hear something weird?
Phoebe  Always.
Ross  I didnt get the annulment.
Phoebe  What?!
Ross  Were still married! Dont tell Rachel. See you later. (He gets
up leaving Phoebe in shock.)
Ross  (To Rachel) Hey, do you have any gum?
Rachel  Oh? Yeah! Sure!
Phoebe  (running out) Wait! Wait! Hi! Listen, Ross can I just talk to you for
just a second?
Rachel  Oh but Phoebe, were gonna be late for the movie.
Phoebe  Oh, theres a cab! Taxi!! (The cab stops and she opens the door.)
Good timing, my God, huh? Here you go. (Pushes Rachel in and closes the door.)
Rachel  Yeah, were, were actually just gonna walk cause
its right up there at the Angelica.
Phoebe  Oh, the Angelica!! Go! Go! (She bangs on the cabs roof and it
pulls away.) (To Ross) You didnt get the annulment?!!
Ross  I know.
Phoebe  Ross?!
Ross  Well, I tried! But when I got to my lawyers office all I could hear
was, "Three divorces. Three divorces!" Look, I just dont want my tombstone
to read, Ross Gellar, Three Divorces.
Phoebe  Dont be worried about that! Your tombstone can say whatever you
want it to say! It could say, Ross Geller, Good at Marriage! Yknow? Mines
gonna say Phoebe Buffay, Buried Alive.
Ross  Look, all I know is I-I cant have another failed marriage!
Phoebe  So okay what? Youre gonna be married to a girl who doesnt
even know about it?!Op, woman! Sorry.
Ross  Well, okay so, I dont have it all worked out quite yet. Just
dont say anything to Rachel, please?
Phoebe  Rachel is one of my closest friends. (Pause) Although, being the only
one who knows anything about this does makes me feel special. Okay!
Rachel  (to the driver) Okay, stop-stop! Phoebe?!
Phoebe  Hey Rach!
Rachel  What was that?!
Phoebe  Sorry, mix up. Hey, how was the movie?
Rachel  I havent seen it yet!
Phoebe  Well then youd better hurry! The Angelica! Go! Go! (Bangs on the
roof again and off they go.)
Rachel  Noooooooo!!
{Transcibers note  In case youre wondering, and I know you are. Their names
are all back to normal. Just in a slightly smaller font than usual to allow Courteney Cox
Arquette to fit on one line and not be smaller than the rest of their names. Now, on with
the show}
[Scene  Monica and Rachel's, Chandler and Monica are cuddling on the couch.]
Chandler  Yknow when we move in together, can I get a gumball machine?
Monica  Of course! Joey wouldnt let you have one?
Chandler  No. When it comes to sweets, hes surprisingly strict.
Monica  Hey, have you figured out a way to tell him youre moving out?
Chandler  No, no, I keep trying, yknow? I can get out, "Joey, I have
too" but then I lose my nerve and I always finish with, "go to the
bathroom." He may think Im sick.
Monica  Yknow, I really have to tell Rachel, but I We just have to
get it over with! Yknow, the next time we see them were just gonna tell them.
Okay? Thats it.
Chandler  Oh, so thats this is gonna work now? Youre just gonna
order me around all the time?
Monica  Pretty much.
Chandler  All right.
Joey  (entering) Hey Monica!
Monica  Hi!
Joey  (To Chandler) Hey man, you feeling any better? (Chandler answers him
with some guttural sounds that only he can make and that no human can transcribe.)
Monica  Joey, we have something to tell you.
Joey  Oh my God! Youre pregnant!
Chandler  No-o-o! (To Monica) No? (She nods no.) No-o-o! Look Joey, heres
the thing, Monica and I have decided to live together, here. So, Im gonna be moving
out man.
Joey  Wow! (Tearing up) Well, uh Hey! Im really happy for you guys!
Congratulations! (Kisses Monica on the cheek) See you later. (Starts for the door on the
verge of tears as Monica stops him.)
Monica  Wait! Joey! Joey! Are you okay?!
Joey  Yeah, I gotta go! I got an acting job. (Turns towards the door, pauses,
and turns back.) Like youd believe that. This sucks!
Chandler  Look, I-Im just gonna be right across the hall and I promise
you, the minute Monica and I break up Im moving right back in with you!
Joey  (To Monica) Okay! Look-look-look, uh, if youre gonna be moving in
with him I feel its my responsibility to tell you the truth about him! Okay?
Hes a terrible roommate! Terrible! He uh, forgets to umm Oh-oh he always, he
always ummOh, who am I kidding! Hes the best roommate ever! (Hugs Chandler.)
[Scene  Central Perk, Phoebe is on the couch as Monica enters.]
Monica  Hey Pheebs!
Phoebe  Hey!
Monica  Hey, have you seen Rachel?
Phoebe  No, why?
Monica  I have some pretty exciting news!
Phoebe  (gasps) Youre pregnant!
Monica  No! Chandler and I are moving in together!
Ross  Hey! Hi!
Monica  Hey!
Ross  Whats up?
Monica  Well umm, Chandler and I are moving in together.
Ross  Oh my God. Ohh, my little sister and my best friendshaking up. Oh,
thats great. Thats great. (Kisses and hugs her.)
Phoebe  Guys, Im happy too.
Monica  Okay, come here! (Phoebe joins them in the hug.)
Phoebe  Wow! Big day huh? People moving in, people getting annulled (Winks
at Ross.)
Monica  Okay, I gotta go find Rachel but umm, if you guys see her could you
please try to give her some really bad news so that mine doesnt seem so bad?
(Exits.)
Ross  Bye.
Phoebe  Hmm, something bad to tell Rachel Bad news for Rachel, what could
that be?!
Ross  Could ya just, could ya just lay off, please? All right? My life is an
embarrassment! I should go live under somebodys stairs!
Phoebe  Ross, its not that big a deal! So youll been divorced three
times, youll still have a life, youll go on dates
Ross  (interrupting) No! No, I wont! Ill be at the bottom of the
dating barrel now. The only guys below me will be Four Divorce Guy uh, Murderer Guy,
and-and, Geologists.
Phoebe  Ross, youre being ridiculous! Okay? You are cute and smart and
sweet and that is much more important than three stupid divorces!
Ross  Oh yeah? Have you ever dated anyone who has been divorced three times?
Phoebe  Yknow thats really fair. Yknow? Most guys who have
been divorced three times are like 60. Ross, nobody cares about this except you! This-this
embarrassment thing is all in your head! Here, Ill show you! Come here.
Ross  What?! Why?
Phoebe  (to the girls) Hi! Hi! Listen, my friend Ross is about to be divorced
for the third time, but wouldnt you date him?
Ross  And if you wait right here, Ill go get Ross. (Phoebe grabs his arm
and prevents him from escaping.)
[Scene  Monica and Rachel's, Monica is pacing anxiously waiting for Rachel.]
Chandler  (entering) Hey!
Monica  Ugh, I thought you were Rachel!
Chandler  (looking down) What gave me away?
Monica  I just tell her, I have to get it over with. I told Ross and Phoebe and
shes the only one left!
Chandler  Okay, so thats it, everybody knows! Its official,
were moving in together. No turning back. Are ya scared? Are ya?
Monica  No.
Chandler  Wow that was my scariest voice! Youre very brave.
Rachel  Hey!
Chandler  Hey.
Rachel  Ugh, the worse day! Yknow, you think youre making progress
at work and then your boss calls you Raquel.
Chandler  Hey listen, for the first four years of my work everybody called me
Sha-la-lap. (Awkward silence ensues.) Seriously.
Rachel  I believe you. So, it was right in the middle of a staff meeting so of
course no one else wants to correct her so everyone else is calling me Raquel! By the end
of the day, the mailroom guys were calling me Rocky!
Chandler  Well, I-I still think youre very-very nice and very pretty
Rachel  What?
Chandler  (To Monica) All yours babe. (Walks away.)
Monica  Have a seat. (They sit at the table.) Okay, listen umm, Chandler and I
are going to live together, here.
Rachel  Oh my God! Thats so great! Im so happy for you guys!
Monica  Really?!
Rachel  And that was so sweet of you to ask! Oh my God, the three of us are
gonna have such a good time living together!
Monica  Yes, we are. (Chandler is frantically trying to get Monica to correct
her.)
Rachel  And Chandler, youre gonna have to watch those long showers you
take in the morning because you know Raquel cant be late.
Chandler  Rach
Monica  Yeah, hes gonna work on that.
Rachel  Ohh! This is so exciting! Oh God (Gasps and starts to sing)
Come and knock on my door
Monica  (singing) Well be waiting for you
{Transcibers note  Ill finish that one for those of you who dont know
what theyre talking about. Where the towels are Hers and Hers and His,
Threes Company too! Yeah, thats the theme song for Threes Company.}
[Scene  Central Perk, Phoebe is hosting an impromptu roundtable discussion with
Stephanie, Karin, and Meg about Rosss three divorces.]
Ross  once you know the stories, its not that bad. First marriage,
wifes hidden sexuality, not my fault. Second marriage, said the wrong name at the
altar, a little my fault. Third marriage, well they really shouldnt allow you to get
married when youre that drunk and have writing all over your face, Nevadas
fault.
Phoebe  Okay, so what do you think ladies? Who wouldnt be interested? Who
wouldnt want to date him?
Stephanie  Well the divorces dont bother me, Id date him. But, not
while hes still married.
Phoebe  Okay, what about you? (Points to Karin) Wouldnt you want a date?
Karin  Actually, Im dating at all anymore. See, I figured out that I was
only dating guys that were like yknow bad for me, so until I work that out
Phoebe  (interrupting) Whatever! What about you Meg?
Meg  Well, I dont care about the divorces either, but I wouldnt date
him. Its just that hes obviously still in love with this Rachel girl.
Ross  What?!
Phoebe  (leaning to him) She said, "Hes obviously still in love with
this Rachel girl." (He glares at her.)
Ross  This is crazy! I mean, yes-yes Rachel is my good friend and I-I have loved
her in the past, but now, she is just my wife! Phoebe, will you-will you help me
out here?
Phoebe  Well, I thought you loved her when you-when you married her.
Ross  We were drunk! I wouldve married uh, Joey with that amount of
alcohol!
Phoebe  Hey! You could do a lot worse than Joey Tribbiani!!
Ross  (to the panel) Look, Im sorry, but you guys are wrong. I just
dont want to be divorced three times.
Phoebe  Yes, and now hes using this three divorces reason because he wants
to stay married to her because he loves her. I must say, "Well done!" Bravo Meg.
Ross  (getting up) Okay! Fine! Fine! If-if this is what you think, forget about
the whole three divorce thing! Okay, I-Ill go to my lawyers office right now
and get this marriage annulled! Okay?! Because she means nothing to me! Noth(leans
down to Megs ear)Nothing!!
Meg  Okay now I wouldnt date you because you seem a little creepy.
Karin  I am so attracted to him right now.
[Scene  Monica and Rachel's, Chandler and Monica are still debating about how to tell
Rachel that Chandlers moving in and shes moving out.]
Chandler  Okay, when are we gonna tell Rachel what is actually gonna happen?
Monica  Soon! I-I just couldnt before. You saw how upset Joey got! I
couldnt do that to her, shes my best friend!
Chandler  Well, Joeys my best friend.
Monica  Im not your best friend?
Chandler  You just said Of course youre my best friend. Would you
please tell Rachel though?
Monica  All right, all right, at least Im prepared.
Chandler  Okay. (She grabs a tin of freshly baked cookies) Oh yes. (He reaches
for one.)
Monica  (slapping his hand) Hey!
Chandler  Hey-hey!
Monica  These arent for you! Are you upset?
Chandler  I am now!
Rachel  (entering) Hey roomie!
Chandler  Okay, bye! (Exits.)
Monica  Rach, theres something uh, important I have to tell you.
Rachel  (gasps) Are you pregnant?!
Monica  No! But, Im throwing this shirt away! I think there was a little
misunderstanding before.
Rachel  Um-hmm.
Monica  Umm, when I said that uh, that Chandler and I wanted to umm, live
together we meant alone together.
Rachel  (laughs) Oh my God! Oh, thats funny, I cant believe I did
that.
Monica  Oh no sweetie, no! This is my fault, I wasnt clear! Im
really sorry. And listen, you take as much time as you need to move out okay? Theres
absolutely no rush.
Rachel  Okay. (Sits back and resumes her reading.)
Monica  Okay. Dont you want a cookie?
Rachel  Sure? (Monica hands her one.) Thanks.
Monica  Maybe, do you need a tissue?
Rachel  Monica, where did you get these?!
Monica  I made them!
Rachel  Ooh, good God, theyre so yummy! (She re-ingests the previously
expelled cookie matter from the tissue.)
[Scene  Chandler and Joey's, Chandler is packing some books and Joey is watching him.]
Joey  God, its gonna so weird like when I come home and youre not
here. Yknow? No more Joey and Chans. No more J and Cs. "You wanna
go over to Joey and Chandlers?" "Cant, its not there."
Chandler  Look, Im just gonna be across the hall, we can still do all the
same stuff.
Joey  Yeah but we wont be able to like get up in the middle of the night
and have those long talks about our feelings and the future.
Chandler  Not once did we do that.
Monica  (entering) Hi.
Chandler  Hey!
Joey  Hi.
Monica  So I, I told Rachel it was just gonna be the two of us.
Chandler  Oh yeah? Well, howd she take it?
Monica  Really well. Yeah. Surprisingly well. Yeah, she didnt cry. She
wasnt angry or sad. (Sits down, slightly disgusted.)
Chandler  And youre upset because you didnt make your best friend
cry?
Monica  I mean, all Im asking for is just a little emotion! Is that too
much to ask after six years?! I mean what? Are-are-are Rachel and I not as close as you
guys?! I mean do we not have as much fun?! Dont I deserve a few tears?!! I mean
we-we told Joey, he cried his eyes out!
Joey  Hey! I did not cry my eyes out!! Come on! Its like the end of an
era! No more J-man and Channies!!
Chandler  Okay, I gotta ask, who calls us that?!
[Scene  Rosss lawyers office, his name is Russell and has just been told by
Ross about his current situation.]
Russell  You got married again.
Ross  Yes.
Russell  So thats your second marriage in two years.
Ross  Yes, second in two years. Third overall.
Russell  Ross, I have been a divorce attorney for 23 years and never had I so
much business from one client. Why dont you tell me what happened.
Ross  Basically, Rachel and I were in Vegas and we got drunk
Russell  (interrupting) Im sorry, is this the same Rachel whos name
you said at the altar in the second marriage?
Ross  Yes-yes-yes! But, I-I do not love her.
Russell  Oh, thats better then.
Ross  This was just a drunken mistake and I need to get it annulled.
Russell  I see. Have you considered therapy?
Ross  I think just the annulment for today.
Russell  There are a couple of forms to fill out.
Ross  Easy.
Russell  And well need to have witnesses who can testify that you were not
of uh, sound mind.
Ross  No problem.
Russell  And well need you and Rachel to testify before a judge.
Ross  Ooh! Theres no way to do this without her? Cause I kinda all
ready told her uh, it was, it was already taken care of.
Russell  Of course you did. Look Ross, you cant get an annulment unless
you and Rachel are both there.
Ross  Uh-ha, what about someone who looks like Rachel? (Russell glares at him.)
I will think about the therapy.
[Scene  Monica and Rachel's, Rachel is painting her toe nails as Monica enters.]
Rachel  Hey!
Monica  Hey. So um, I was thinking that maybe we should start dividing up our
stuff.
Rachel  Okay!
Monica  Yknow, no point in dragging it out. Dragging out the long
process of you moving out and us not living together anymore.
Rachel  Okay.
Monica  Hey Rach, what about this? (She holds up a chrome 5-point star.) Huh?
Who-who gets this? See, I dont know if I want it because it might be yknow,
too many memories!
Rachel  (grabbing the star) What the hell is that?
Monica  I dont know. (Picks up a big plate from the coffee table.) Hey,
Rachel, you want the big plate? I want you to have the big plate.
Rachel  Wow! Mon, thanks! I love this plate!
Monica  Something to remember me by!
Rachel  Mon, honey youre not dying. Im just moving out. Yknow,
I mean were gonna see each other all the time.
Monica  But still, its a big change. The end of an era, you might say!
Rachel  Are you okay? Youre not blinking.
Monica  Im fine! I just, Im thinking how much its an end of
era.
Rachel  Oh, all right. But yknow I gotta say, I dont, I dont
think six years counts as an era.
Monica  An era is defined as a significant period of time. Now, it was
significant to me, maybe it wasnt significant to you!
Rachel  What is the matter with you?!
Monica  What is the matter with you?!! Why arent you more upset?!
Arent you gonna be sad that were not gonna be living together anymore?! I mean
arent you gonna miss me at all?!
Rachel  All right, fine, but dont get mad at me. Its-its just
a little hard to believe.
Monica  Whats hard to believe?
Rachel  Well yknow, its you guys. You-you do this kind of stuff!
Yknow? I mean, you-you were gonna get married in Vegas and then you backed out! I
guess Im not upset because I dont see you guys going through with it. Im
sorry.
Monica  Rachel, its going to happen. Chandler is gonna move in here.
Rachel  But I
Monica  No-no, wait! Just let me finish, okay? This isnt something that we
just, we just impulsively decided in-in Vegas, this is something we both really want. And
it is going to happen.
Rachel  It is? Really?
Monica  Yeah, sweetie.
Rachel  (starting to lose her composure) I mean were not, were not
gonna live together anymore?
Monica  No.
Rachel  What? Oh my God! Im gonna miss you so much! (Starts to cry.)
Monica  Im gonna miss you! (They hug.)
Rachel  I mean its the end of an era!
Monica  I know!
[Scene  The hallway, Ross is coming up the stairs as Phoebe leaves Joey and
Chandlers.]
Phoebe  (to Joey and Chandler) Okay, bye!
Ross  Oh no.
Phoebe  So? Did you get the annulment?
Ross  I couldnt.
Phoebe  I knew it! Because you love Rachel.
Ross  Its not that. Okay? Annulments are more complicated than I
Phoebe  Yeah, complicated cause of the love.
Ross  I I do, I do not love Rachel. Im gonna tell her right now
about the whole thing so we can get this marriage annulled as fast as possible. Okay?
Would I do that if I loved her?
Phoebe  Ive never been more convinced of your love for her.
Ross  I do not have feelings for Rachel! Okay?! (He goes into her apartment.)
Ross  Ohh, whats wrong?!
Rachel  Monica and Chandler are really moving in here and I have to move out and
everything is changing.
Ross  Oh myCome here! Come here! (He hugs her.) Its okay.
Everythings gonna be okay.
Rachel  Thank you.
Ross  Of course.
[Scene  Central Perk, Joey and Phoebe are talking.]
Joey  So, Ross and Rachel got married, Monica and Chandler almost got married,
do you think you and I should hook up?
Phoebe  Oh we do, but not just yet.
Joey  Really?! Well, when?
Phoebe  Okay umm, well, first Chandler and Monica will get married and be filthy
rich by the way. Yeah. But it wont work out.
Joey  Wow.
Phoebe  I know. Then, Im gonna marry Chandler for the money and
youll marry Rachel and have the beautiful kids.
Joey  Great!
Phoebe  But then we ditch those two and thats when we get married.
Well have Chandlers money and Rachels kids and getting custody will be
easy because of Rachels drinking problem.
Joey  Oh-oh, what about Ross?
Phoebe  I dont want to go into the whole thing, but umm, we have words and
I kill him.
[Scene  Monica and Rachel's, Joey, Monica, and Phoebe are there as Chandler enters.]
Chandler  (entering) Hey!
Phoebe  Hey! Check it out! This is unbelievable! Joey has been holding his
breath for almost four minutes!
Joey  (To Chandler) Dude! What are yoyou trying to kill me?!
Rachel  (entering from her room) Pheebs, I wanna ask you something.
Phoebe  Uh-huh, what?
Rachel  Well since Im movin out and-and youre so
beautiful
Phoebe  Oh!
Rachel  how about I move in with you?
Phoebe  Well, that would be great but then what do we do about Denise?
Monica  Whos Denise?
Phoebe  My roommate.
Rachel  You have a roommate?!
Phoebe  Yes, Denise. Denise!
Joey  Hey, what is with the secrecy Phoebe? Huh? And what about this Denise, is
she cute?
Chandler  Pheebs, I dont understand. How can you have a roommate that none
of us know anything about?
Phoebe  Maybe because you never listen to anything that I say. I talk about her
all the time! DENISE!!!!!
Joey  Hey Rach, listen I was thinkin uh, Im gonna have an extra room
over at my place
Rachel  Oh, thats true.
Joey  Yeah, why dont you move in with me? Itll be great! We could
stay up late, watch movies, and you know about Naked Thursdays right?
Rachel  Yeah, yeah I think Im gonna find my own place.
Chandler  Hey-hey! I thought Naked Thursdays was just our thing man!
[Scene  Central Perk, Ross is reading a magazine, eating a cookie, and drinking some
coffee as Phoebe enters.]
Phoebe  Hey.
Ross  Hey!
Phoebe  So, what did Rachel say when you told her you were still married to her?
Ross  Oh, that. Umm, she took it really well.
Phoebe  You didnt tell her did you?
Ross  No.
Phoebe  Of course not, because youre in love with her.
Ross  I am not in love with her. She was very upset about having to move out so
I eh, didnt tell her we were still married because she would only get more upset.
I-I just comforted her, as a friend.
Phoebe  What do you mean, comforted her?
Ross  Its nothing, I just gave her a hug.
Phoebe  Ah-ha! A classic sign of love, the hug!
Ross  Its also a sign of friendship.
Phoebe  Yeah, not in your case Lovey Loverson. (Tries to take a bite out of
Rosss cookie.)
Ross  (grabs back his cookie) It was a hug!
Phoebe  Okay, just tell me this, did you or did you not smell her hair?
Ross  S-s-smell her hair? What if I did?
Phoebe  Ninety percent of a womens pheromones come out the top of her
head! Thats why, thats why women are shorter. So that men will fall in love
when they hug them! (Ross is staring at her dumbfounded.) Oh come on Ross, youre a
scientist.
Ross  I was hugging her as a friend. Its not my fault her-her hair got in
my face, shes got a lot of it and it smells all-all uhcoconutty. (Phoebe
raises her eyebrows.) What?! Oh, that doesnt mean I have feelings for Rachel! Maybe
it means I have feelings for coconuts!
Phoebe  (taking his coffee) Okay, whatever you say. But just be careful, all
right? Rachels not in the same place you are.
Ross  (grabbing back his coffee) If the place you are referring too is being in
love, then she is in the same place as me because I am not in that place!
Phoebe  Okay, I didnt understand that, but yknow, maybe thats
cause you were speaking the secret language of love!
[Scene  Monica and Rachel's, Chandler and Monica are there as Joey enters.]
Joey  Hey! (To Chandler) Dude, some guy just called for you.
Chandler  Who was it?
Joey  I dont know! How about, "Thanks for taking the message."
Jeez! (Exits.)
Monica  Okay listen, yknow when you move in Rachels room is gonna be
empty, you wanna talk about what we want to do with it?
Chandler  Sure!
Monica  Okay, I was thinking we should have a beautiful guest room, right? With
a mahogany sleigh bed and bedside tables with flowers on them all the time! And we could
have a roll top desk with comment cards on them so people could say how much they loved
staying here!! Okay, whatever, I really havent thought about it that much.
Chandler  Well, I like that idea. Obviously! I was thinking maybe-maybe-maybe it
could be a game room, yknow? I mean you can buy old arcade games like uh, like Space
Invaders and Asteroids for $200, the real ones! The big-big ones!
Monica  No.
Chandler  Okay so you mean no as in, "Gee Chandler, what an interesting
idea. Lets discuss it before we reject it completely."
Monica  Oh, Im sorry. Of course I mean that. Interesting idea, umm, talk
about it, but no.
Chandler  So, thats it?
Monica  I just dont think arcade games go in the beautiful guest room. The
beautiful guest room is gonna be filled with antiques.
Chandler  Which is why Asteroids is perfect! Its the oldest game!
Monica  What do you have against the beautiful guest room?
Chandler  I dont have anything against the beautiful guest room,
especially since everybody we know lives about 30 seconds away!
Monica  Are you mocking me?
Chandler  No, Im not mocking you, (in a mocking voice) or you beautiful
guest room. (Exits.)
[Scene  Chandler and Joey's, Chandler is coming from across the hall.]
Joey  Hey, whats up?
Chandler  Nothing, Monica and I had a stupid fight.
Joey  But youre still moving in together, right? Because my ad came out
today. (Shows him the paper.)
Chandler  (reading the ad) "Wanted. Female roommate, non-smoker,
non-ugly." Nice!
Joey  Yeah? I just figured yknow, after living with you itd be an
interesting change of pace to have a female roommate, yknow? Someone I can learn
from, someone-someone whos different than me. And whats more different than
me; a guy whos not 19 than say a girl who is 19? Enh? (Points to his head.)
Not just a hat rack my friend!
[Scene  Central Perk, Phoebe is on the couch staring off into space as Rachel enters.]
Rachel  Pheebs, I have to ask you
Phoebe  Shhhhhh! Im swamped right now.
Rachel  Youre just staring into space.
Phoebe  Umm, Im trying to move that pencil. (Theres a pencil lying
on the table.)
Rachel  This one? (Picks it up.)
Phoebe  It worked!
Rachel  Pheebs, this whole apartment thing is just a nightmare! Every place I
can afford comes with a roommate who is a freak. I mean, look at this; (Points to one and
starts to read it.) "Wanted. Female roommate, non-smoker, non-ugly." Its
just, there is nothing! The citys full!
Phoebe  Wait, no, look at this! (Points to one.) (Reading) "Two bedroom,
two bath, must be non-smoker, Satan worshipers okay" Oh, yeah, but its on
the ground floor.
Ross  (entering) Hey!
Rachel  Hey.
Ross  Rach, uh, you still looking for a place?
Rachel  Yeah! Why?
Ross  Okay, theres this guy, Warren, from the museum and hes going
on a dig for like two years and hes got this great place he needs to sublet. So uh,
you interested?
Rachel  That sounds great! Id love to live at Warrens!! I love
Warren! Thank you!
Ross  Dont thank me! If you wanna thank something, thank the volcano that
erupted thousands of years ago, killing but perfectly preserving an entire civilization.
(Rachel just looks at him.) Heres Warrens number.
Rachel  Oh, this is great! I am gonna call him right now! (Jumps up.) Oh, thank
you!
Ross  Okay, you go grab it!
Phoebe  I saw it.
Ross  I dont know what youre talking about.
Phoebe  Umm, Im talking about that which you already know but wont
admit. You love her again; you re-love her!
Ross  Look, I do not re-love her.
Phoebe  I cant believe you wont just admit it! (Pause) Okay, just
promise me that you wont do anything stupid.
Ross  Look, were just friends now! Okay? Why would I do anything stupid?
Rachel  (returning from calling Warren) Ugh!!! Well, the apartment is already
subletted! I mean, this is just hopeless. Im never gonna find anything.
Ross  You can live with me.
Rachel  What?!
Phoebe  What?!
Ross  What?
[Scene  Central Perk, continued from earlier.]
Rachel  Oh my God! Are you serious?!
Ross  Uh-huh. (Phoebe grunts.)
Rachel  I would love to live with you Ross; thats-thats great! Thank
you!
Ross  Well, Im-Im just glad I could, yknow, help you out.
Phoebe  Wow! Im-Im so happy for you guys. (To Ross) This is so-so,
not stupid.
Rachel  Ross-Ross, you have no idea what this means to me! I mean, I mean I was
gonna be homeless. You just saved me! Youre my hero!
Ross  Hero, I uh, I dont knowwell, all right.
Rachel  Oh, I have to go tell Monica what a wonderful brother she has! (Kisses
him on the cheek and exits.)
Ross  Oh please! (He sits down.) (To Phoebe) Youre gonna say things now,
arent ya?
Phoebe  No. No, I wont. But I should tell you this, this exact same thing
happened to my roommate Denise. She moved in with a guy who was secretly married to her
and he said he didnt love her, but he really did, and it just blew up! And
thats how she ended up living with me! (Ross looks at her.) (Pause) Okay,
thats a lie.
[Scene  Monica and Rachel's, Monica is in the kitchen as Chandler enters.]
Chandler  Hi.
Monica  Hi.
Chandler  Hi, listen, Im sorry about before. I dont need to have a
game room. I mean when I was a kid I only played those games because I couldnt get
girls, and now I can emNow, I have you. (Monica glares at him.) Not-not
that I think that I have you or think of you as property in any sort of way, I see
women
Monica  Stop it Chandler. (Chandler is relieved) Im sorry too.
Chandler  Really?
Monica  Yeah! Oh yes!
Chandler  Ohh.
Monica  Listen, we dont have to make that a guest room, we can think of
something to do with the room together.
Chandler  Thats a great idea! We can easily think of a way for us
both to enjoy the room.
Monica  Totally!
Chandler  We dont have to come up with this now.
Monica  Oh good.
Chandler  Hey, yknow what? Why dont we think about changes we can
make in the living room?
Monica  Changes?
Chandler  Yeah, I mean were gonna have to move around some furniture to
make room for my chair. (Kisses her and heads into the living room.)
Monica  Youre-youre-youre gonna bring the Barca Lounger over
here?
Chandler  Is that a problem?
Monica  Well, its a set and they should probably stay together.
Chandler  Oh, thats cool. Then Ill just bring them both over.
Monica  See now-now youre taking them away from their home.
Chandler  Okay, I get it. So, I get nothing! Nothing here is mine! Everything
here is yours! Ill get up in the morning put on your clothes, and head off to work!
Monica  Yeah-yeah, yknow what? Yeah, thats it-thats it,
everything will be mine! Nothing will be yours! Thats-thats what I said! Oh
come on, Chandler! Im talking about the barca lounger! It just, it doesnt
match! Where is it gonna go?!
Chandler  In the game room!
Monica  Look it is not my fault that your chairs are incredibly ugly!
Chandler  All right! Thats fine! Thats fine! I wont bring over
the chairs! I wont bring anything over! I wouldnt want to ruin the ambiance
over here at Grandmas place!! (Storms out.)
[Scene  Chandler and Joey's, Joey is interviewing a potential roommate. And yes,
shes a female, non-smoker and very non-ugly.]
Joey  (exiting from Chandlers room with the new roommate) Everything on
your application looks really goodOhh! Just one last question umm, are you and your
friends gonna be over here all the time like partying and hanging out?
The Potential Roommate  Oh dont worry, Im not really a party girl.
Joey  Whoa!! Now look, dont be just blurtin stuff out. I want you to
really think about your answers. Okay?
Chandler  (entering) You can call off the roommate search! (To the potential
roommate) Hi! Ill be living here. (Heads for the bathroom.)
Joey  Oh dont listen to him, hes just some guy who really wants the
apartment, but I dont think hes gonna get it.
Chandler  Why did you take the shower curtain down?
Joey  That thing was a hazard! (To the potential roommate) Im very safety
conscious.
[Scene  Rosss Apartment, Rachel is entering and Ross is making some room on the
shelves for his stuff.]
Rachel  Hey!
Ross  Hey! Oh listen, I was just clearing some space for your stuff.
Rachel  Oh thanks, but listen, I was just at Monicas and she and Chandler
had a big fight and theyre not moving in.
Ross  What do you mean, theyre not moving in? They-theyre still
moving in right?
Rachel  No-no, they just had a big blowout over what to do with my room.
Ross  What?! Over a stupid room!
Rachel  Yeah, I feel kinda bad for them, but Im also really psyched
cause I dont have to move in here!
Ross  Oh no, yeah no, that parts great!
[Scene  Monica and Rachel's, Ross is entering, dragging Chandler, to mediate the
argument between Chandler and Monica.]
Ross  Whats all this about you guys fighting?! Is this really over a
room?! I mean, that is so silly!
Monica  Ross, we can handle this.
Ross  Well, apparently not, and I cant just stand by and watch two people
I care about very much be hurt over something that is so silly. I mean, enough of the
silliness!
Chandler  Well, why dont you tell her to stop being silly! (Monica mocks
him and he joins in.)
Ross  (stopping them) Okay-okay! Two very good points, look Ive known you
both a long time, and Ive never seen either of you one/millionth as happy as
youve been since youve got together. Do you really want to throw that all away
over a room? That is so silly. Now wh-what is more important, love or silliness?
Chandler  Well, we are fond of the silliness, but we also have a soft spot for
the love.
Monica  Love is the best medicine.
Chandler  Thats laughter.
Monica  Why do you do it?
Chandler  I dont know.
Ross  Okay! All right! Now, Chandler you-you wanna live with Monica, right?
Chandler  Yeah, I do.
Ross  And Mon, you wanna live with Chandler, dont ya?
Monica  Yes.
Ross  (jumping up) Good! A verbal contract is binding in the state of New York!
(Storms out.)
[Scene  Central Perk, Rachel is sitting at the counter waiting for Gunther, yep
Gunthers back, to refill her coffee.]
Gunther  So I understand youre looking for a place.
Rachel  No-no, Im staying put.
Gunther  Oh, I was going to offer you my apartment.
Rachel  Why, where are you going?
Gunther  I dont know.
Ross  (entering) Hey Rach!
Rachel  Hi!
Ross  Youre never gonna believe it uh, Monica and Chandler are moving in
again. Thats great news rightI mean for them. Right?
Rachel  Oh wow.
Ross  Yeah but, on the bright side, we get to be roommates again.
Rachel  Yeah. Yknow umm, uh, umm, about that, umm, Ross I really
appreciate your offer to let me move in and everything, but dont you think its
gonna be weird?
Ross  Wh-why?! Why-why-why would it, why would it be weird?
Rachel  Well, because of us! Because of our history.
Ross  No!
Rachel  No?
Ross  No! No! It would be weird if we were still in that place, I mean are you
still in that place?
Rachel  No! Not at all!
Ross  Good! Me neither! So its not a problem. Were just two friends
who happen to be roommates.
Rachel  Okay, but Ross, eventually you and I are gonna be dating.
Ross  Really?! We are?
Rachel  Yeah! Im gonna have a boyfriend, youre gonna have a
girlfriend
Ross  Ohh! That would be great.
Rachel  But yknow what, if you think its gonna be okay well
just work out a system. Yknow, itll be like college, Ill hang a hanger
on the door and put a sign, "Come back later, Im gettin lucky."
(Laughs.)
Ross  (laughs as well, but for a different reason) Yeah, I didnt think of
that.
[Scene  Monica and Rachel's, Chandler is once again being dragged in by Ross so he that
he can try to manipulate the situation so that its best for Ross, not necessarily
whats best for Monica and Chandler.]
Ross  So are you sure about this whole moving in thing?! I mean its a really
big step! And-and whats the rush?!
Monica  Thats very funny!
Chandler  Hes being silly, because he knows that we enjoy the silliness!
Ross  No, I-I-Im serious, okay? I mean, think about it. You move in, you
start fighting over stupid game rooms, next thing yknow you break up!
Monica  Ross, you were right before, it was just a stupid fight about a room.
Ross  Okay, there are no stupid fights!! This isnt about the room, this is
about what the roomrepresents! And unfortunately, this room (Points to Rachels
room) could destroy you!!
Chandler  Yeah, I'm not so worried.
Monica  Yeah, no, me neither.
Ross  Fine! Its your life! (Starts to storm out mad about his failed
attempt at the manipulation of his best friend and sister, but stops and tries one last
time.) I just dont want to see you guys break up! Which you will do if you
move in together, (Monica and Chandler just stare at him.) but thats what you want,
theres nothing I can do. (Opens the door and tries one more time.) DONT DO
IT!!!!! (Finally leaves.)
Monica  You still want to move in together right?
Chandler  Of course!
Monica  Ross didnt scare you?
Chandler  Scared me out of ever wanting to live with him.
Monica  Come here, I want to show you something!
Chandler  Okay!
Chandler  Oh my God! Someones killed Square Man!
Monica  This is where I thought the barca lounger could go! You see you could
see the TV and its still walking distance to the kitchen.
Chandler  Oh thats so sweet! I want to show you something too!
Monica  Okay!
Chandler  Yknow those big-big uh, road signs that say "Merge?"
Monica  Uh-hmm.
Chandler  Yknow? So I was thinking that we could get one of those signs
and hang it over our bed. Because, thats you and I together! Merge!
Monica  Oh my God! I love that!
Chandler  Really?!
Monica  Uh, no!!
[Scene  Central Perk, Phoebe is singing a new song. Yep, the first new Phoebe song of
season six, Ross, Joey, and Rachel are also there.]
Phoebe  (singing) I found you in my bed! 
                         
Howd you whined up there? 
                         
You are a mystery!
                         
Little black curly hair!
                         
Little black curly hair!
                         
Little black, little black, little black, little black, little black curly
hair
Phoebe  Now if you want to receive e-mails about my upcoming shows, then please
give me money so I can buy a computer.
Ross  (To Rachel) So umm, where are the other guys?
Rachel  Umm, well lets see Monica and Chandler are occupied.
Ross  Fighting?!
Rachel  No, the other thing. I really think its great they work things
out.
Ross  Yeah. Theres no breaking them up, is there?
Rachel  Hey, can I borrow the key to your house so I can run across the street
and make a copy?
Ross  Sure! Here. (Hands her his keys.)
Rachel  Thank you. (Gets up) Now are you sure? Because once I make a copy,
theres no turning back.
Ross  Yeah, Im-Im sure. (Deadpan) Yeah, get out of here before I
change my mind. (She exits)
Joey  Umm, listen, Ross do you really think this moving in with Rachel is a good
idea?
Ross  Ive been back and forth.
Joey  Yeah well, maybe you should go back! Okay? Rachel moves in, and before you
know it youre right where you dont want to be! Back together!
Ross  Ehh, I dont, I dont think so. Shes already talked about
yknow, dating other guys.
Joey  Thats not gonna work out! Then shes gonna come home all weepy
and youll be tellin her, "Oh thats okay. Youll find
someone." And then, bamn! She finds you!
Ross  Yeah, well, m-maybe youre right.
Joey  I am telling you Ross, she is definitely gonna fall in love with you
again! Now, is that what you want?
Ross  Is that what I want?
Phoebe  (on the microphone, accidentally) Yes.
Joey  Here she comes. Hold on, Im gonna make your life much easier.
Rachel  All right, well the place was closed. Ill just copy it later.
Joey  Or not. Uh, Rach, why dont you just move in with me? (Rachel sighs.)
Ross  Whoa! Whoa! Whoa, Joey!
Joey  No-no-no-no-no-no-no-no Its okay, I mean Ilook Rach, I
know I scared you off with that whole Naked Thursdays thing, but we dont have
to do that!
Rachel  Well, it would be easier to move just right across the hall. Wait a
minute, unless youre thinking about Naked Wednesdays.
Joey  Thursdays clearly not good for ya, pick a day!
[Scene  Chandler and Joey's, Joey has The Potential Roommate back for another
interview.]
Joey  (opening the door to The Potential Roommate) Hi!
The Potential Roommate  Hi!
Joey  Come in. Thanks for comin back, umm, okay there have been a lot of
people interested in the room, but I have narrowed it down and you are one of the
finalists!
The Potential Roommate  Great!
Joey  Okay now, before I make my final decision I uh, I just want to make sure
our personalities match. Okay, so I made up a little test. Now, Im gonna say a word
and then you say the first thing that comes to mind.
The Potential Roommate  I can do that.
Joey  Okay! Here we go. Pillow.
The Potential Roommate  Fight.
Joey  Very good! Okay. G.
The Potential Roommate  String?
Joey  Excellent! Okay umm, doggy.
The Potential Roommate  Kitten?
Joey  Ooh, sorry! No-no-no, so close though, butbye-bye! (He ushers her
out the door.)
[Scene  Monica and Rachel's, Rachel is packing her belongings to move to Rosss.
Shes standing in the kitchen.]
Rachel  So, which of this kitchen stuff is mine?
Monica  This bottle opener. (She grabs it off of the freezer door.)
Rachel  And?
Monica  And its a magnet!
Rachel  Look at that!
Ross  How weird is that? Yknow? Youre moving in with me and have the
one thing I dont have. Its like uh, in a way you-you complete me
(Phoebe glares at him) kitchen.
Rachel  What?!
Ross  (in an Australian accent) You complete me kitchen, matey!
Phoebe  Ross, I know what youre thinking.
Ross  What?
Phoebe  That shes gonna move in with you and maybe then shell fall
in love with you and then when she finds out youre already married, shell just
be happy. Yknow? Youre just, youre very sad.
Ross  OhmyGod! I-I see what this is! You are in love with
Rachel!
Phoebe  What?!!
Ross  Of course! It all adds up! I mean you youre obsessed with her.
Its always, "Ross, what are you gonna do about Rachel?" "Ross,
why-why are you moving in with Rachel?" "When are you gonna confess your secret
marriage to Rachel?" You want her!
Phoebe  No! (Rosss phone rings.)
Ross  (answering it) Uh-oh, saved by the bell. (On phone) Hello?
Monica  Hey Rach, arent these candlesticks (holds up a pair) mine?
Rachel  No-no, I bought those.
Monica  Ohh! Yeah, I forgot.
Rachel  Yeah. (Rachel walks away.)
Monica  (under her breath) That youre a liar. (Hides the candlesticks in a
drawer.)
Ross  (on phone) No-no-no, thats great! Ill be there Monday. And
thank you again! (Listens) Okay. (Hangs up) (To All) Umm, that was the head of the
Paleontology department at N uh, Y, uh U!
Monica  Wow! Uh what, did he uh, say?
Ross  Well remember that paper I had published last year on sediment flow rate,
huh? They loved it.
Rachel  Well, who wouldnt?!
Ross  I know! Anyway, they asked me to be a guest lecturer! I mean its
temporary, but uh, if they like me it could lead to a full time job. How great would that
look great on a mailbox, huh? "Professor Geller."
Phoebe  Yeah, Professor and Mrs.
Rachel  And Mrs.?!
Phoebe  Oh! Yeah, yknow you and Ross are still married.
Rachel  What?!!
Phoebe  Just kidding!
Rachel  Ohh! Oh God! (Laughs her way into the living room.)
Phoebe  (To Ross) Saved your ass.
[Scene  Central Perk, Joey, Monica, Rachel, and Chandler are all there as Phoebe enters
dejectedly.]
Chandler  Hey!
Phoebe  Hi.
Monica  Hey!
Chandler  Oh, whats the matter?
Phoebe  Well, you know that psychic I see?
Chandler  Yeah?
Phoebe  Well, she told me that Im gonna die this week, so Im kinda
bummed about that.
Chandler  What?!
Phoebe  Yeah, and I know you guys dont know a lot about psychic readings,
but that one is pretty much the worse one you can get.
Monica  Phoebe thats crazy!
Joey  I cant believe she would say that too you.
Rachel  Yeah honey you dont believe her do you?
Phoebe  I dontshe said yknow that Id have triplets! But
she also said one of them would be black.
Chandler  Just out of curiosity did she tell you how youre gonna go?
Phoebe  No, cause she didnt tell me I was gonna die until the very
end of the session, and I was not gonna waste a whole another hour there! I mean Ive
only got a week left, yknow? Ive really gotta start living now! (So she
picks up the latest copy of Car and Driver (a U.S. auto magazine), leans back, and
starts reading.)
Ross  (entering) Hey everyone!
Chandler  Oh hi!
Ross  Hey uh, well, todays my first lecture and I kinda wanted to try it
out on you guys, do you, do you mind?
All  Oh thatd be great. Sure!
Ross  (he starts reading directly from his cards word for word very quietly)
"There are three primary theories concerning sediment flow rate. Each of these
theories can be further subcategorized into two distinct"
Phoebe  Oh, this is it. This whats gonna kill me.
Ross  (continuing) "subcategories. The first of these subcategories
is"
Joey  (interrupting him) Uh Ross! Are there uh, are there naked chicks on that
piece of paper?
Ross  No! Why?
Joey  Well, Ive just never seen a guy stare so hard at a piece of paper
that didnt have naked chicks on it.
Ross  Ohh! Okay! Okay. (Resumes reading word for word from the card) "There
are three (pauses and looks at Joey) primary theories concerning sediment flow rate.
(Pauses and darts his eyes between Chandler and Rachel.) (Rachel starts laughing) Each of
these theories (glances at Phoebe) can be further subcategorized (glances at Chandler)
into"
Chandler  Why dont you open with a joke?
Ross  Open with a joke? Its a university, not a comedy club!
Chandler  Wait a minute, hold the phone! Youre not talking about
Chuckles University?!
Ross  (gets up) Okay!
All  Ohh! Were kidding! Oh, were kidding!
Rachel  Ross, hey you know what might make it less boring?
Ross  Thank you!
Rachel  Some uh, some visual aides.
Joey  Oh-ooh-ooh! Yknow whats a good visual aide?
Ross  Please dont say naked chicks.
Joey  Why not?!
Ross  I-I-I dont even know why I bother to talk to you guys about it.
Yknow what? Im just gonna do it on my own with no naked chicks.
Chandler  Thats the way I did it til I was 19.
[Scene  Chandler and Joey's, Joey is playing that string game with the two hands and
the weird crossing patterns as Chandler enters with the mail.]
Chandler  Hey.
Joey  Hey! Any good mail?
Chandler  Yes, you got something from the Screen Actors Guild.
Joey  Ooh, its probably a residual check, hey can you open it for me,
Im kinda.
Chandler  (opens and reads it) "Benefits lapsed."
Joey  Hmm thats weird. I dont remember being in a move called
benefits lapsed.
Chandler  Okay, its not a check. Theyre saying your health insurance
expired because, you didnt work enough last year.
Joey  Let me see that!
Chandler  All right.
Joey  (reads it) Oh, I cant believe this! This sucks! When I had insurance
I could get hit by a bus or catch on fire, yknow? And it wouldnt matter. Now I
gotta be careful?!
Chandler  Im sorry man, theres never a good time to (pauses) stop
catching on fire.
Joey  All right well, I guess I gotta go get a job. Im gonna go see my
agent.
Chandler  Okay, make sure you look both ways before you cross the street.
Joey  (mocks him, in a whiney voice) look both ways before you cross the
street. (Turns and walks headlong into the closed door.)
[Scene  Monica and Rachel's, Phoebe enters to find Rachel still packing.]
Phoebe  Hey!
Rachel  Hey Pheebs, youre still alive! How are you doing?
Phoebe  Ugh, its so exhausting waiting for death. Ohh, by the way,
do you think you could(Groans, hacks, and then freezes with her eyes open and her
tongue hanging out.)
Rachel  Pheebs, what-what are you doing?
Phoebe  I was preparing you for mydidnt you think I was dead? Did
that not come off?
Rachel  Oh yeah, scared the hell out of me. I thought wed lost you
forever. Pheebs, you lie down?
Phoebe  Yeah, thanks. And listen, can you do me a favor? Could you just umm,
wake me up in a couple hours, yknow if you can.
Rachel  Monica!
Monica  Hmm? (Rachel holds up the candlesticks.)
Rachel  Did-did you take these back?
Monica  No-no, I-I just, I liked them so much that I went out and bought some
for myself.
Rachel  Oh yeah, theyre really great! Arent they?
Monica  I loved them!
Rachel  Yeah. (Monica walks away) Nice try! (Rachel puts them in a box.)
Ross  (entering) Hello!
Monica  Hey!
Rachel  Hey!
Monica  Howd the lecture go?
Ross  It went great! And I didnt need any jokes or naked chicks either!
Rachel  Wow, thats great Ross, Im sorry we werent more
supportive before.
Ross  I knew all I had to do was let the material speak for itself.
Everyones all, "Ross you have to be funny and sexy." Well, I proved them
wrong! And now, Im gonna pass the news onto Joey and Chandler.
Monica  That youre not funny or sexy?
Ross  Thats right!
[Scene  Estelle Leonard Theatrical Agency, Joey is there to see his agent.]
Joey  (entering) Hey Estelle, listen
Estelle  Well! Well! Well! Joey Tribbiani! So you came back huh? They think
they can do better but they all come crawling back to Estelle!
Joey  What are you talkin about? I never left you! Youve always been
my agent!
Estelle  Really?!
Joey  Yeah!
Estelle  Oh well, no harm, no foul.
Joey  Estelle, you gotta get me some work. I-I lost my health insurance.
Estelle  All right, first thing we gotta do, damage control.
Joey  Why?
Estelle  Well, I think uhh, someone out there may have been bad mouthing you all
over town.
Joey  Bastard!
[Scene  Chandler and Joey's, Chandler enters to find Joey lying in the fetus position
on the floor.]
Chandler  Hey!
Joey  (in obvious pain) Hey! So Estelle lined up a bunch of auditions for me
tomorrow and Ill have my health insurance back in no time.
Chandler  Thats great, but shouldnt you be on the toilet right now?
Joey  What?!
Chandler  Whats wrong with you?
Joey  Nothing! Well, I-I got this blinding pain in my stomach when I was lifting
weights before, then I uh passed out and uh, havent been able to stand up since. But
um, I dont think its anything serious.
Chandler  This sounds like a hernia. You have toyou-you go to the doctor!
Joey  No way! Kay look, if I have to go to the doctor for anything
its gonna be for this thing sticking out of my stomach! (Rolls over and shows
Chandler.)
Chandler  Thats a hernia.
Joey  Why did I have to start working out again? (Looks at the weights he was
using.) Damn you 15s!
[Scene  a NYU lecture hall, Rachel and Monica are arriving to talk to Ross after the
lecture, but are there early.]
Rachel  Well, were a little early, the lecture doesnt end for 15
minutes.
Monica  Yeah, but yknow we could sneak in and watch.
Rachel  Yeah, we could. Oh hey look! Theres some Kappa Kappa Deltas! I was
a Kappa. (to them) Hey sisters! (They ignore her.) (To Monica) Wow, we really are bitches.
Ross  (to the class) Right! So when Rigby got his samples back from the
laboratory he made a startling discovery! What he believed to be igneous, was in fact
sedimentary. Imagine his consternation when(sees Monica and Rachel.) Oh bloody hell.
[Scene  a NYU lecture hall, the scene is continued from earlier, only Ross has
dismissed the class and is now talking to Monica and Rachel.]
Monica  What the hell are you doing?!
Ross  Look, I was nervous! You guys had me all worried I was going to be boring!
I got up there and they were all like staring at me. I opened my mouth and this British
accent just came out.
Rachel  Yeah, and not a very good one.
Ross  Will you-will you please?
The Professor  Dr. Geller, Kurt Rathman, Im a professor in the
paleontology department here.
Ross  Oh.
The Professor  Do you have a moment to talk about your lecture?
Ross  (in his British accent) Im sorry, Ive got plans with my
sister.
Monica  (in an Irish accent) Monica Gellerrr. (She rolls her R)
Ross  (in accent) Right, will you excuse us for one moment? (Takes Monica
aside.) (In his normal voice.) What are you doing?
Monica  (normal voice) Oh, you can have an accent and I cant?! (To an
exiting student in accent.) Top O the morning to ya laddies!
Ross  Just please stop!
Rachel  (in an Indian accent) Yes, yes, Bombay is bery, bery nice time of year.
[Scene  Central Perk, Chandler is reading on the couch while Joey, still suffering from
his hernia, is returning with coffee for them both. After a series of grunts and groans he
manages to painfully walk back from the counter, sit down, and slide Chandler his coffee.]
Chandler  Hey, will you grab me a cruller? (Joey starts to groan and get up.)
Sit down! Will you go to the hospital?!
Joey  Dude! Hernia operations cost like, a lot probably. Besides its
getting darker and more painful, that means its healing.
Chandler  I will loan you the money. Just go to the hospital and lets just
get that thingpushed back in.
Joey  Thank you, but it would take me forever to pay you that money back and I
dont want that hanging over my head. Okay? Besides, as soon as my insurance kicks in
I can get all the free operations I want! Yeah, Im thinking Ill probably start
with that laser eye surgery too.
Phoebe  Hey!
Chandler  Hey.
Joey  Hey!
Phoebe  Whats going on?
Chandler  Oh Joeys got a really bad hernia, but thats nothing a
little laser eye surgery wont fix!
Joey  Look, Im telling you if I put my hand on my stomach right here (He
puts his hand down his pants, like Al Bundy on MarriedWith Children always
used to do.) it doesnt hurt that bad.
Phoebe  Hey! Maybe youll die!
Joey  Sure, now Im scared.
Phoebe  No, we can go together! Just dont wait too long though, okay?
Cause Im outta here sometime before Friday.
Joey  Yeah, but I dont wanna die!
Phoebe  No-no, itll be fun! We can come back and we can haunt these guys!
[Scene  Monica and Rachel's, Monica and Rachel are having a tug-of-war over the
disputed candlesticks.]
Monica  Gimme em!
Rachel  No! They are mine!
Monica  You stole them from me!
Rachel  You stole them from me!!
Monica  Gimme them!
Monica  You just wanna each take one?
Rachel  Yeah that seems fair. We never use them.
Ross  (entering) Look, I really need some help, okay? Why? Why did I have to
speak in a British accent?! What do I do?
Rachel  Well
Monica  Why dont you phase it out? Yeah, fade the accent out and people
will think youre, yknow, that youre adjusting to life in America.
Rachel  Yeah, I mean, come on Ross, no one will even notice. I mean theyre
probably not even listening!
Ross  Theyre not listening too me?
Rachel  Of course theyre listening to you! Everybody listens to you.
Ross  Monica you really think I should try this phasing out thing?
Monica  I think you look fine.
[Scene  Casting Director #1s office, Joey is on his first audition. His partner
is an 8-year-old boy.]
Casting Director #1  Whenever youre ready.
Joey  (in a gravely, painful voice) Okay. "Hey, Timmy, Ive got a
surprise for you."
Casting Director #1  Hold it. Im sorry, the surprise is a new swing set,
if you could play it a little lessintense?
Joey  Oh yeah, sure, no problem, Ill justhold on one second. (He
turns around and puts his hand in his pants and groans in relief.) (In a relaxed voice.)
"Hey Timmy, Ive got a surprise for you!"
Casting Director #1  Oh my God!!
[Scene  Casting Director #2s office, Joey is on his second audition. This one is
for Purina One Dog Chow, an actual item. Please note the gratuitous product
placement.]
Joey  So thats why I feed my dog Purina One! Pick up a bag today!
(He turns, looks at the bag and realizes he wont be able to pick it up.)
Casting Director #2  Thats where you pick up the bag.
Joey  Exactly.
Casting Director #2  No, the line is pick a bag, so you need to pick up the bag.
Joey  Or, I could just point to it! Huh? Blah, blah, blah, Purina One,
point to a bag today. (She just looks at him.) I didnt get it, did I?
Casting Director #2  No.
Joey  Yeah, okay. (Leaves)
[Scene  Casting Director #3s office, Joey is entering.]
Joey  Hi. Im Joey Tribbiani; Im here to audition for (Groans) man.
Casting Director #3  You mean dying man?
Joey  Yes!
[Scene  Monica and Rachel's, Monica and Rachel are playing phone pranks on Ross.]
Monica  Okay, come on, do it one more time!
Rachel  Really? Really?!
Monica  Yes!
Rachel  Okay! (Picks up the phone and starts dialing.) (In an Irish accent)
"Hello Ross, this is Dr. McNeeley from the Fake Accent University, wed like you
to come on board with us full time! (Hangs up.)
Phoebe  (entering) Hey!
Rachel  Hey!
Phoebe  Listen to this! My reading was wrong, Im not going die!
Rachel  Really?! How do you know?
Phoebe  Because my psychic is dead! She mustve read the cards wrong!
Rachel  Oh, Im sorry.
Phoebe  Eh, better her than me! Hey, lets bake cookies!
[Scene  Silvercup Studios, Joey has won the part of dying man and is now able to play
the role he was injured for. Chandler is helping to carry him in.]
Chandler  Listen, Im really glad you got the part.
Joey  (barely audible through the pain) Thank you.
Chandler  But are you sure you can do this?
Joey  Yeah! And hey, thanks for coming with me. And thanks again for helping me
take a shower.
Chandler  Now, is that never talking about it again?!
Joey  (to the director) Hiya!
The Director  Hey Joey, were ready for ya! (Joey stumbles over) Joey, this
is Alex hes going to be playing your son.
Joey  Hi Alex! (to the director) And uh, as you can see my hands are not in my
pants. (Holds them both up.)
The Director  Okay. (to Alex) All right uh, Alex now when Joey says his line,
"Take good care of your Momma son," thats your cue to cry. Got it? (Alex
nods yes.) All right, lets do this.
A Crew Member  (with that board thingy) Scene 5, take 1.
The Director  And Action!
Joey  "Take could care of your Momma son." (Alex just looks at him and
the director motions for him to continue so he tries it again.) "Take could care of
your Momma son." (Alex does nothing.) "Come on son! Your Mommas good
people!"
The Director  Cut! Alex, remember youre supposed to cry. Can you cry for
us this time?
Alex  Okay.
The Director  All right, from the top.
A Crew Member  Scene 5, take 2.
A Crew Member  Take 36 is up!
The Director  All right! Lets try this again! You ready Joe?
Joey  Ah, just one thing umm, is it all right with you if I, if I scream right
up until you say action?
The Director  Uh sure.
Joey  Okay. (Starts screaming.)
The Director  Action!
Joey  (he stops screaming at action) "Take good care of your Momma
son." (Again Alex does nothing.)
The Director  Cut!!!!!!!!!! (Joey starts screaming again.)
Chandler  Im sorry! Hey-hey Joe, why dont you uh, lift up your
shirt? (He does.) Take a look at this kiddo. (Alex finally starts crying.) We
have a crying child! Roll the damn cameras!
[Scene  Ross and Rachels apartment, Rachel is unpacking as the phone rings.]
Rachel  (answering it) Hello?
Russell  (Rosss divorce lawyer.) Hello, is Ross there?
Rachel  Uh no, hes not. Can I take a message?
Russell  Yes, this Russell, Rosss divorce lawyer, just tell him that since
I havent heard from him, I assume hes decided to give the marriage a try.
Rachel  Ross got married againNooooooo!!!!!!!!!
[Scene  a NYU lecture hall, Ross is trying to phase out his accent.]
Ross  (in his head) All right, keep going. We are phasing the accent out,
phasing it out. So without out re-testing the results in the laboratory (pronounced
the British way) the team would never have identified (British) the initial errors in
their carbon dating analysis (British). Were there any questions at this point? (One
student raises his hand.) Yes. (Points to him.)
A Student  Whats happening to your accent?
Ross  (British) Come again? Whats-whats this nonsense? (Giggles.)
(American.) All right, Im-Im not English. Im from Long Island. I was
really nervous and the accent just uh, just came out. Im sorry. So, if we could just
get back to the lecture. Umm, were there any questions? (Everyone raises their hands)
About paleontology. (They all put their hands down.) All right, look I was just trying to
make a good first impression. Obviously, I screwed up. But what you guys think of me is
really important because Im-Im hoping to get a permanent job here. So if you
just give me another chance to make a good impression
Rachel  Ross!! Are you crazy?! I am still your wife!! What, were you just
never gonna tell me?!! What the hell is wrong with you?!!!! Ugh, I could just kill you!!!!
Ross  (in the accent again) Well, hello Rachel!
[Scene  Chandler and Joey's, Joey is holding a football helmet; and apparently, in a
rather disgusting scene, Joey wants Phoebe to beat him senseless. (Luckily it isnt a
long trip.) Because hes made a miraculous recovery from his hernia and wants to take
advantage of all those free surgeries he can get now since hes re-established his
health insurance.]
Phoebe  Have you really done this before?
Joey  Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! You just take a big, big swing. Now, dont hold
back. (He dons his protective helmet (Why, I have no clue.) and Phoebe picks up a wooden
baseball bat and starts to swing as Chandler and Monica enter.)
Phoebe  Hey!
Joey  Hey-hey-hey!
Chandler  What are you doing?
Phoebe  Were just celebrating that Joey got his health insurance back.
Chandler  Oh, all right.
[Scene  Monica and Rachel's, the gang is there except for Rachel and Ross, who both
come storming in. Rachel is still going off about Rosss secret marriage.]
Rachel  I cannot believe that you didnt tell me that we are still
married!!
Ross  Look I was going to tell you!
Rachel  When?! After the birth of our first secret child?! (To All) Ross
didnt get the annulment; we are still married.
Chandler  What?
Monica  Youre kidding!
Phoebe  (overdoing it) Oh my God!!
Monica  Ross!
Ross  Okay, maybe it wasnt my best decision. But I just couldnt face
another failed marriage.
Chandler  Okay, let me just jump in and ask, at what point did you think this
was a successful marriage?
Ross  Rach, come on, if you think about it, its actually kinda funny. (He
laughs, and he laughs alone.) Okay, maybe its best not to think about it.
Phoebe  Okay, this is inexcusable. I am shocked to my very core!
Ross  Phoebe, I told her you already knew.
Phoebe  Another lie. You have a sickness!
Chandler  Ross, just for my own piece of mind, youre not married to
anymore of us are ya?
[Scene  Central Perk, Joey and Monica are at the counter getting some more coffee.]
Gunther  Yeah, thats what I drive. I make four bucks an hour, I saved up
for 350 years!
Joey  Na-uh! (To everyone there) Hey did anybody lose their keys?
Monica  Joey, why dont you put them in the lost and found?
Joey  Theres a lost and found? (Gunther sets the box up on the table.) My
shoe! (Grabs it out of the box.)
Chandler  You left a shoe here?!
Joey  Well, I didnt realize until I got home. I wasnt gonna walk all
the way back down here with one shoe! Yknow what? Im gonna go find that
guys car and leave a note on the windshield. (Goes to do so.)
Chandler  Oh good, when he comes back for his keys, Ill be sure to give
him your shoe.
Joey  Great! Thanks. (Exits.)
Phoebe  (coming in from the bathroom) Oh, good, good, you guys are here! Listen,
how would like to spend tomorrow taking care of three incredibly cute little puppies?!
Monica  Oh my God, what a fun day! That sounds great!
Chandler  (not enthused) Yeah, all right.
Phoebe  Okay, well Ill bring them by tomorrow morning. Okay, and uh, by
the way, theyre not actually puppies, theyre Frank and Alices triplets.
Okay, see ya! (Exits.)
Chandler  Whoa-whoa-whoa! What?
Phoebe  (stops) Please! Please! Please! Please! Oh please! Please! Please! Frank
and Alice asked me to baby sit the triplets and Im nervous cause Ive
never done that before by myself!
Monica  Dont worry about it Phoebe, well absolutely do it.
Chandler  Yeah, Im gonna pass. Cause I was kinda iffy when it was
puppies.
Monica  Come on Chandler, come on! Itll give us great practice for
when(realizes what shes about to say and changes)people with babies come
to visit.
[Scene  The street down the block from Central Perk, Joey has found the Porsche and is
writing the note.]
Guy #1  Nice car!
Joey  Yeah, its not mine.
Woman  (walking up) I love your car.
Joey  Yeah, its (looks up and sees the woman) mine.
Woman  I bet its fast.
Joey  Me too! Yeah. And comfortable. Do uh, do you like leather seats?
Woman  Yeah!
Joey  (checks in the window to make sure it has them) Its got em!
[Scene  Monica and Rachel's, Phoebe and Rachel are having tea.]
Rachel  So, I still have boxes here. I still have boxes at Rosss, and
I have nowhere to live! Wow. I could so easily freak out right now.
Phoebe  What about me? I just found out that Denise is leaving town for a while,
I dont have a roommate.
Rachel  Well, maybe-maybe I could be your roommate Pheebs.
Phoebe  Maybe you could be my roommate!
Rachel  Well theres an idea!!
Phoebe  Yeah!
Rachel  That would be great! Wait, how long is Denise gone for?
Phoebe  Umm, she said shed be back December 26th.
Rachel  December 26th, huh maybe shes Santa Clause.
Rachel  (deadpan) Oh look who it is, my husband. The apple of my eye.
Rachel  Well sure, if you say youre gonna take care of everything I have
no reason to doubt you. Give me those forms! (Grabs them from him.) All right, now
Im gonna do this my way and I dont want to hear a peep out of you!
Ross  Okay Rach, but
Rachel  Op! Youre peeping!
Rachel  Ross! Yknow what, I just gotwhy? Why did you do this?!
Ross  Look I told you
Rachel  I dont wanna hear "Three failed marriages!"
Ross  Look, if youd had two failed marriages, youd understand!
Rachel  Well, yknow what? Thanks to you Im half way there! Ugh! Oh!
I am so mad! Ross, I dont think I have ever been this angry!
Ross  What about the time I said we were on a break?
Rachel  Ugh! (Stares at him.)
[Scene  Monica and Rachel's, the next day, Chandler, Monica, and Phoebe are
baby-sitting the triplets. They each have one baby.]
Monica  Pheebs, hows it going?
Phoebe  (rapidly) Im doing okay. I think its going well. Do you
think theyre having fun? Am I talking to fast?
Monica  Nope, sound like me. Pheebs, its going great. Look at Chandler
with little baby girl Chandler.
Chandler  Little baby girl Chandler, where I have heard that before? Oh right,
Coach Ruben. (Tries to get her to drink a little more from the bottle when he suddenly
smells something. Its times like these Im glad Smell-O-Vision hasnt been
invented.) Do you know what Pheebs? When youre done over there, we kinda have a
situation over here too. (Phoebe is changing hers.)
Phoebe  Na-uh, no, we are all responsible for our own babies.
Chandler  See thats where I think that youre wrong. Weve been
playing these babies man for man; we should really be playing a zone defense.
Monica  What do you mean?
Chandler  I just think that things would go a lot smoother if we each have our
own zone. Phoebe, you can be in charge of wiping. And yknow Mon, you can be in
charge of diapering and I can be in charge of looking how cute they are when they put
their hands around (He degrades into baby talk, but he means when they grab his
finger.)
Phoebe  That sounds really great, but maybe you should be in charge of wiping.
Chandler  Okay, Im a rookie. I should not be in the end zone.
Monica  This is so great! This is exactly how we set the plates at the
restaurant.
Phoebe  Yeah? (Checking the final diaper) Well this is not what I ordered.
Joey  (entering) Hey guys!
Chandler  Hey!
Phoebe  Hey!
Joey  Hey babies! Oh, Im having the best morning. That uh, that Porsche
Ive got the keys too, still there!
Chandler  Shocking! Since you still have the keys.
Joey  You should see the treatment I get when Im with that car! People are
friendly; they-they wanna talk, and not just about the car! One guy gave me advice about
my equity investments.
Chandler  What equity investments?
Joey  The ones that got me the Porsche! Will you keep up! (Chandler wipes his
forehead with a baby wipe, that might have been used. He drops it disgustedly.) But I
figured, if-if people keep seeing me just standing there, theyre gonna start to
think that I dont own it. So I figured Ill wash it. Right? Monica, you got a
bucket and some soap I can borrow?
Monica  Oh yeah, I got soap and sponges and rags and Carnuba wax and polishing
compound.
Chandler  You dont even have a car!
Monica  I know. But umm, one time there was this really dirty car in front of
the building, so I washed it.
Chandler  And?
Monica  And six others.
Chandler  There you are.
[Scene  The Porsche, Joey is finishing up washing the car and is talking to a guy about
the car.]
Joey  Yeah, she tops out at 130.
Guy #2  Wow!
Joey  And thats just in the city. I get her up to 160 when I take her
upstate.
Guy #2  Really! You got a place upstate?
Joey  Sure!
Guy #2  Well, Ill see you later.
Joey  Okay, take it easy.
The Porsche Owner  Hey! Thats my car.
Joey  Really? Oh uh, oh just give me five more minutes with it.
The Porsche Owner  What-what are you doing?
Joey  Oh I-I uh, found the keys and now Im just polishing her up.
The Porsche Owner  But its my car!
Joey  Yeah, but its my wax.
The Porsche Owner  Listen, I-I-I dont come to this city much so I
dont know if youre crazy or this is some kind of street theater, but could I
have my keys.
Joey  Sure. Here. (He hands them over.) Ill uh, save your parking spot.
The Porsche Owner  Im not coming back.
Joey  Why not?
The Porsche Owner  I live upstate.
Joey  Yeah, so did I.
[Scene  Monica and Rachel's, the triplets are all in their crib as Monica and Phoebe
watch them.]
Phoebe  I dont know why I was so nervous about this. And I dont know
why Frank and Alice are always complaining. This is so easy.
Monica  Yeah, two hours, a lifetime thats the same.
Chandler  (entering) Check it out! Check it out! When the babies wake up, they
can meet Krog! (He holds up this Xena-like warrior action figure.)
Monica  Chandler, what are you doing? That thing can put someones eye out!
Chandler  He can do more than that! He can destroy the universe!
Phoebe  No Chandler, they can swallow one of those little parts! And also, look
at his smooth area, thats just gonna mess them up.
Chandler  Theyre not gonna swallow anything, you guys are being way over
protective. When I was a kid, my mom used to just throw me into a pile of broken glass!
Phoebe  What?!
Chandler  Glass, sand, whatever. (Walks out as Monica and Phoebe turn to check
on the babies again.)
Phoebe  Oh, look at little Leslie stretching in her sleep.
Monica  Oh its so cute. I wonder what age it is when you stop being able
to put both legs over your head.
Phoebe  Oh, I can still do that.
Monica  How are you still single?!
Chandler  (entering) All right. (Clears throat) I thought about it and maybe
youre right. Maybe Krog is not a safe toy.
Monica  Good. What made you change your mind?
Chandler  I swallowed the sonic blaster gun.
Phoebe  How did that happen?!!
Chandler  Well, I was trying to prove that I was right. Yknow? And it
turns out I was wrong. And now its lodged in my throat. (Mimics a cat trying to
cough up a hairball.) (He does it again.)
Monica  Damnit! Yknow this whole time we were concentrating on watching
the babies and, and no one was watching Chandler! (He does it again.)
[Scene  A judges chambers, Rachel and Ross are filing their annulment papers.]
Judge  Okay you two are asking the court for an annulment?
Rachel  Yes your honor, and here are, are forms, all filled out.
Judge  So based on your petition you are seeking an annulment on the grounds
that Mr. Geller is mentally unstable.
Ross  Fine, Im mentally unstable.
Judge  And based on the fact that Mr. Geller is intravenous drug user.
Ross  What?!
Rachel  Uh yes, heroin and crack.
Ross  Crack isnt even an intravenous drug!
Rachel  Well, you would know.
Judge  Now it also says here that you lied about your sexual preference before
marriage?
Ross  Oh, come on!
Rachel  (starts to cry) Ross, please, I found the magazines!
Judge  And finally that you were unable to consummate the marriage. Well, that
makes sense since youre gay and addicted to heroin.
Ross  Okay, Im sorry, this is insane! I-I-Im not addicted to heroin,
Im not gay, and there is no problem with my ability to consummate anything!
Look, Ill consummate this marriage right here, right now!
Judge  That wont be necessary.
Ross  And when we were dating we consummated like bunnies!
Rachel  Ugh!
Judge  Now if you were two involved in a serious relationship, that really
creates a problem.
Rachel  Ross! Your honor, rest assured relationship ended like two years ago!
(To the stenographer) And could you strike "Consummated like bunnies" from the
record?
Judge  Is there, anything in this record that is actually true?
Rachel  Well, yes, we got married in Vegas and uh, and the names I think.
Judge  Well, based on what I heard, you two certainly dont qualify for an
annulment. If you two dont want to be together youll have to file for divorce.
Ross  (stands up) Thats great! Are you happy now? Look what you did with
your funny, funny form!
Rachel  (stands up as well) What?! Me?! What about you and your consummated like
bunnies nonsense!
Ross  And what(notices the stenographer is still typing)What are you
typing that for? Did you hear what she said? We dont get the annulment. Dont
type that! What?! Stop typing! (He goes over to where the stenographer is typing and in
the process pushes Rachel out of his way.) Hey! Stop typing! (Hes still typing.)
Stop typing! Stop typing!!
Rachel  (to the judge) Okay, do you see, do you see what youre keeping me
married too?!
Judge  You need to get out of my chambers.
Rachel  All right look lady here is the deal, I came here for an annulment and I
am not leaving here until I get one!
Ross  Yeah!
Judge  Would you like to spend the night in jail?
Rachel  And thank you for your time. (They both beat a hasty retreat.)
[Scene  Monica and Rachel's, Chandler is still doing the hairball thing as Monica and
Phoebe are watching the babies. I cant describe it, youll have to see it when
it comes on in your area.]
Joey  (entering wearing nothing but Porsche clothes) So the Porsche guy took his
car back.
Chandler  But you found the keys to his clothes?
Joey  No. No, I just uh, I just loved the way it feels when everybody thinks I
own a Porsche.
Monica  And people will think you own a Porsche because youre wearing the
clothes?
Joey  Of course! Only an idiot would wear this stuff if you didnt have the
car! Right?
Chandler  That is true.
Phoebe  Yeah, but only a genius would swallow a sonic blaster gun.
Joey  Oh, Ive been there. Yeah, I am gonna go drive my Porsche. (Starts to
leave.)
Monica  Joey, you know you dont actually have one.
Joey  Come on! What are you doing?! Im in character! Would you talk to
her! (Storms out.)
Chandler  Ahh, I think it just moved. Its really poking me.
Monica  All right, thats it, were going to the emergency room.
Phoebe  What?! No, you cant, you cant leave me here with them!
Were baby-sitting!
Monica  The babies are asleep, Im sure youll be okay on your own for
a while!
Phoebe  But you-you cant leave me with them! We-were a team!
Were playing a zone! Theyre gonna triple team me!
Monica  Hes got something plastic lodged in his throat, weve got to
go to the hospital.
Phoebe  But no, because a doctor wont be able to help him, its just
gonna yknow naturally pass through his system in like seven years.
Chandler  I think thats gum.
Phoebe  Im pretty sure its gun.
Chandler  Okay, listen this really hurts. Lets go.
Phoebe  A real man wouldnt just run to the hospital! (They dont
stop.) No! What would, what would Krog do? (They ignore her and Phoebe is left alone.)
[Scene  The street, Joey is hanging out wearing his Porsche grab.]
Joey  Why isnt that valet back with my Porsche?
Passerby  Maybe because youve got the keys?
Joey  (to women passing him) Porsche.
Rachel  This is totally your fault!
Ross  My fault?! You threatened the judge!
Rachel  Well, you ripped the paper out of the court reporters machine!!
Ross  That was the only way I could get him to stop typing!
Joey  Hi! How are the Gellers?
Rachel  Dont call us that! (Storms away)
Ross  The judge wouldnt let us get an annulment! Now we gotta get a
divorce!! Did a Porsch throw up on you? (Walks on.)
Joey  Hey! Its Porsche!! (Hes right yknow.)
[Scene  Monica and Rachel's, Phoebe is being triple teamed.]
Phoebe  Me taking care of you is no problem, huh? You guys feel safe. Right?
Okay, Im gonna take that spit bubble as, "Yeah, I do!" Okay, after I get
rid of this dirty diaper Leslie, Ill set you up with a clean one. (She throws it at
the garbage without looking, misses, and knocks over a vase and flowers, which fall to the
floor and break.) Okay, Im sorry. I didnt mean to scare you. I just have to
clean that up. Okay? Cause lets face it, were at Monicas. (She
crawls over, disposes of the diaper, picks up the flowers, and the vase.) I broke it. All
right. Well, thats just the way that goes. (She throws out both the flowers and the
vase.) Okay, good. (She turns around and only counts two babies.) Why are there only two
of you? Where is Leslie? Well, you cant answer. (She starts looking for her) Leslie?
Where are you Leslie? Leslie, now would be a good time for your first words! (She
turns around and finds that Leslie has managed to crawl into the bottom drawer of the TV
cabinet.) Well, look at you! Hey! You are a little bit mischievous! My gosh! (She picks
her up and notices a surprise is waiting in the drawer.) Oh, youre a lot
mischievous! Well, itll dry. (Closes the drawer with her foot.) (To Leslie) Okay,
you sit with your brother and sister nowwho arent there! (They both have
disappeared as well.)
Chandler  (entering) Hey!
Phoebe  (exhausted) How do you feel?
Chandler  Well, lets just say that Krog will be fully equipped to destroy
the universe again in twelve to fourteen hours.
Phoebe  Okay, so I totally took care of the babies all by myself! I fed
em, bathed em, and put em to bed.
Chandler  And protected them from a tornado?
Monica  Oh my God.
Phoebe  I know, the babies are asleep.
Monica  Phoebe, what, what happened here?!
Phoebe  I did it! I took care of the babies all by myself!
Monica  But my apartment!
Chandler  Was the setting of Phoebes triumph.
Monica  But the mess!
Chandler  Is not as important as the fact that Phoebe took care of the babies
all by herself.
Monica  Youre right, youre right I shouldnt freak out.
Cause this is what will happen when you and I have babies! When will that be?!
Chandler  (pause) Phoebe, would you take a look at this mess!!!!
[Scene  Rosss apartment, Rachel is packing what she still has over there as Ross
enters.]
Rachel  (deadpan) Oh honey thank God youre home, I was getting worried.
Ross  I picked up the divorce papers. Uh, Ive already signed everything
and I put little Xs where you need to sign.
Rachel  Oh, little Xs! Great! That makes up for everything!
Ross  Yknow, I-Iyouve done a lot of stupid stuff too! Okay?
Rachel  Oh, name one stupid thing that is as stupid as this one!
Ross  Okay, how about you flew to London to stop my wedding! Ah, how about you
told me you loved me after I was already married!
Rachel  Hey! Wait a minute! That was different! I did those things because I was
in love with you!
Ross  Yeah! Right!
Ross  Youre right. Thats very different. So lets, lets
just sign the papers. All right? (Sits down and Rachel keeps standing there.) What?
Rachel  Nothing. (Sits down.)
Ross  Okay, can we just sign please?
Rachel  Uh-hmm. (Just as Rachel finishes signing her name, Ross yanks each page
out of the way.)
Ross  Congratulations. (Gets up to leave.)
Rachel  Okay Ross, werewait a minute. Umm, I uh, I kinda have a
little confession.
Ross  What?
Rachel  Well, yknow this whole marriage thing, kinda my idea.
Ross  Excuse me?
Rachel  Well, remember how we were too drunk to remember anything the night we
were married?
Ross  Yeah?
Rachel  And uh, yeah, I didnt really, I didnt want to say anything,
but it kinda it just, it kinda kept coming back to me, and umm, remember we were in the
casino and for some reason thought it would be funny to eat a lot of grapes. And uh, and I
thought it would be funnier if we got married. So as a, as a compromise we decided first
to get married, and then (Ross joins in) to eat a lot of grapes. So umm, sorry I got us
into this mess.
Ross  So then if-ifI mean if you think about it, this is all (Pause.) your
fault.
Rachel  Yeah, dont push it though.
Ross  Ive got to say; I know I divorce a lot of women, never thought I
would be divorcing you.
Rachel  I know. I always thought if you and I got married, it would be the one
that stuck. And it wouldnt be a secret, and we wouldnt have our wedding dinner
at Pizza Hut. (They both laugh.)
Ross  Did I, did I even treat?
Rachel  No, it was on the house, it was, it was a newlywed special.
Ross  That may be the most depressing thing Ive heard in my life. I should
probably get these to my lawyers office.
Rachel  Hey, thanks Ross, for taking care of all of this.
Ross  Eh, no problem.
Rachel  Im gonna need a copy of those.
Ross  Totally. (Exits.)
[Scene  The street, Joey is messing with a car cover and still wearing the Porsche
stuff. This guy playing street football catches a pass next to the car cover Joey is
fooling around with.]
Joey  Hey! Hey! Be careful around my Porsche!
Woman  (the same one from before approaches) Hi Joey.
Joey  Hey! How you doin?
Woman  (to her friend) He has the most amazing Porsche under there!
Joey  Id love to show ya, but I just tucked her in. Shes sleeping.
(The women both laugh) Hey uh, would you two girls like to go for a drink? (Just then the
same guy with the football dives to make a catch, lands on the car cover, and collapses
it. It turns out that Joey set up a bunch of boxes to make it look like a Porsche.)

[Scene  Chandler and Joey's, Joey is balancing a mini hockey stick on his hand as
Chandler enters from his room carrying a bunch of bills.]
Chandler  (watches Joey for a moment) Okay! (Joey quickly moves the hockey stick
so that hes scratching his back with it.) Listen, Im gonna be moving out so you
will be in charge of paying the rent.
Joey  Right! And when is that due?
Chandler  First of the month.
Joey  And thats every month?
Chandler  No, just the months you actually want to live here.
Joey  Ahhh.
Chandler  Okay, here is the phone bill. (Hands it to Joey.)
Joey  (looking at it) Oh my God!!
Chandler  Thats our phone number. Now look, I know I kinda sprung this
whole me moving out on thing, so why dont I justwhy dont I just cover
you for a while?
Joey  No-no! No way! Joey Tribbiani does not take charityanymore.
Chandler  Its not charity, Joe
Joey  No! Forget it! OkayI mean thanks, but Im done taking money
from you. All right, I can take of myself. Now, whats next? Come on.
Chandler  Okay uh, heres the electric bill. (Hands it to him.)
Joey  This is how much we pay for electric?!!!
Chandler  Uh, yeah.
Chandler  So, well do the rest of the bills later then?
[Scene  Monica and Rachel's, Chandler is talking to Phoebe about trying to give Joey
some money.]
Phoebe  So is Joey going to have to give up the apartment?
Chandler  No, I hope not! I tried to offer him some money, but he wouldnt
take it.
Phoebe  Well, how much do you think he needs?
Chandler  I figure that $1,500 would cover him for a few months, yknow?
But I have to trick him into taking it so I wont hurt his pride.
Phoebe  Why dont you hire him as an actor? You could have him dress up and
put on little skits. Whatever you want.
Chandler  Well that would help the pride thing.
Monica  (entering from her room) Hey!
Chandler  Hey! Wow! You look great! Wanna move in with me tomorrow?
Monica  (thinks) Okay.
Chandler  Okay! (They kiss) So, what do you girls have planned for tonight?
Monica  Well, instead of being sad that tonight is my last night together with
Rachel we thought wed go out to dinner and celebrate the fact that Rachel is moving
in with Phoebe.
Phoebe  And also, my birthday.
Monica  Its not your birthday.
Phoebe  What a mean thing to say! I would never tell you its not
your birthday!
Joey  Hey!
Ross  Hey!
Chandler  Hey!
Phoebe  Hey! So you guys have anything planned for the big last night?
Chandler  Well, instead of just hanging out, we figure wed do nothing.
Ross  Whoa-whoa-whoa, Knicks season opener tonight. I thought maybe you guys
would come over and watch it.
Joey  I dont know Ross, not if youre gonna talk about how you gave
up a career in basketball to become a paleontologist.
Ross  I did give up a career in basketball to become a paleontologist!
Rachel  (entering from her room) Pheebs, I was wondering
Monica  Youre not dressed yet?! Were supposed to start having fun in
15 minutes!
Rachel  Well and clearly not a minute sooner.
Monica  Rachel, you are packed though right, I mean please tell me that
youre packed.
Rachel  Of course I packed! Monica relax! I just wanted to ask Phoebe her
opinion on what I should wear tonight.
Phoebe  My God, I cant get a minute of peace around this place.
Phoebe  Oh my God! Monicas just gonna kill you.
Rachel  Yeah, yeah, I know.
Phoebe  Well, what youre wearing is fine for that.
Monica  (entering) Rachel, I need to borrowYoure not packed!!!!
Youre not packed even a little bit!
Rachel  Surprise!!
Monica  What?
Rachel  No, no dont get mad because lookthis is what happened. So
I-I started packing, then I realized, "What am I doing? I am lousy at packing!"
Right? But you love packing! So, as a gift to you, on our last night, ta-da!
Monica  (grabs a bag of those Styrofoam peanuts) Ill be coordinator! Oh my
God! Im so sorry, I didnt get you anything! Okay, look everybody has to help!
Okay? You can help, cant you Phoebe?
Phoebe  I have plans.
Monica  Youre plans were with us.
Phoebe  Thats right.
Monica  All right, Chandler can make boxes, Ross can wrap, and Joey can lift
things. Now Phoebe, go tell the guys they have to help out!
Phoebe  Okay.
Monica  Okay! (To Rachel) Oh my God, thank you!!
Phoebe  Hurry! Monicas gonna make you pack! Shes got jobs for
everyone! Now, its too late for me, but save your selves! (The guys scramble for the
door.)
Monica  (entering and interrupting the guys escape attempt) Okay! The
movers will be here in 11 hours. Rachel has not packed. Now, everybody has to help!
Chandler, were gonna start with
Chandler  Oh nope, I-I have plans with Joey.
Monica  I thought you said you were going to do nothing.
Chandler  Yes, but for the last time.
Monica  Okay fine, now Ross
Ross  Oh, but-but I cant do it.
Monica  Why not?
Joey  (quietly) Ive got Ben.
Ross  Because, because Ive got Ben.
Monica  Its almost 8 oclock, its almost past his bedtime.
Where-where is he?
Chandler  Hes at a dinner party.
Monica  Is he really coming? Because I can see right into your apartment!
Ross  Of course he is! What, do you think Id just use my son as-as an
excuse? What kind of father do you think I am?
Monica  All right, sorry. (Goes back to Rachels room.)
Ross  (to the guys) I gotta go make a fake Ben.
[Scene  Chandler and Joey's, Joey is entering carrying two pizzas.]
Joey  Here it is! Our last pizzas together as roommates.
Chandler  Oh, I wish Id know you were going to do that, I ordered Chinese.
Joey  Oh thats okay. Hey, actually in a way its kinda nice. Me,
bringing the food of my ancestors, you, the food of yours!
Chandler  Say, Joe, I had a strange idea of what we could do for our last night.
What do you say we play a little uh, foosball for money?
Joey  What, are you crazy? You havent beaten me once since my injury
plagued 97 season. It would be easier if you just give me your money.
Chandler  Yes it would. What do you say to $50?
Joey  Okay, youre on.
Chandler  Okay, lets play! The big game, Italy vs. China, apparently.
[Scene  Rachels bedroom, shes in her closet bringing down her pair of
roller blades from a top shelf.]
Rachel  Ohhhhhh, look its the roller blades.
Monica  (starting to cry) Oh God!
Rachel  You remember when we got these?
Monica  No.
Rachel  I guess you werent there. (They hug.)
Phoebe  You guys, we said we were gonna have fun! Come on, hey, remember the
time (She starts laughing hysterically.) You dont remember?
Rachel  Im sorry Pheebs, I guess Im just really said that Im
leaving.
Monica  Im gonna miss you so much.
Phoebe  Well, this doesnt have to be so sad though. Yknow? Maybe
instead of just thinking about how much youre gonna miss each other, you should like
think of the things youre not gonna miss.
Monica  I dont think theres anything.
Phoebe  Come on, theres gotta be something.
Monica  Nope, shes perfect.
Rachel  I have one.
Phoebe  Good! Great! You can go first.
Rachel  Uh well, I guess Im not gonna miss the fact that youre never
allowed to move the phone pen. (Laughs. Monica lags behind the laugh a little bit.)
Phoebe  Good thats a good one. Okay, Monica, anything? Yknow? Does
Rachel move the phone pen?
Monica  Aw, sometimes. Always, actually.
Phoebe  Okay, good. There you go. Doesnt anyone feel better?
Monica  Not just the phone pen. I never get my messages.
Rachel  You get your messages!
Monica  Yeah, well I dont think it really counts if you have to read them
off the back of your hand after you fall asleep on the couch.
Rachel  So-so, you missed a message from who? Chandler or your mom? Or Chandler?
Or your mom?
Phoebe  Great! It worked! No ones sad.
[Scene  Chandler and Joey's, they are just finishing up another game of foosball.]
Joey  (scores) Yes! I win again! Ha-ha! Thats like 500 bucks you owe me!
Whoo-ho-hoo! (Goes over to the fridge and starts opening and closing the door rapidly.)
$500 that is a loooot of electricity! (By the way, theres nothing in the fridge.)
Whoo-ho-ho! (Notices the sparseness of the fridge.) I gotta buy some food.
Chandler  Okay, give me a chance to win my money back. Okay? Sudden death, one
goal, $1,000.
Joey  You serious?
Chandler  Oh yes!
Joey  Okay, get ready to owe me!
Chandler  Okay.
Joey  Okay, here we go. Ready?
Chandler  No! No! No! No(Joey looks at him)one can beat me.
Chandler  See? Now, thats why only the little fake men are supposed to do
all the kicking.
[Scene  Monica and Rachel's, the phone rings and Monica answers it as Rachel and Phoebe
move a box into the living room.]
Monica  Hello? (Listens) Oh, hi Ross! (To Rachel) See? Other people call me!
Rachel  Ooh, your brother. Score!
Monica  (on phone) Whats up?
Ross  Oh, Im just over here with Ben. I thought wed say hi.
Monica  Oh, put him on!
Ross  Ben, say hi to Aunt Monica. (He holds the phone to the fake Ben he has
created out of a pumpkin.) Oh, I guess he doesnt feel like talking right now.
Hes smiling though! Okay, talk to you later.
[Scene  Rachels bedroom, Rachel is entering carrying two glasses of wine. She
gives one to Phoebe, keeps one, and completely ignores Monica.]
Phoebe  Yeah, I think it was better when you guys were sad. Hey, uh, remember
the roller blades?
Rachel  You know what else Im not gonna miss? "Im Monica. I
wash the toilet 17 times a day. Even if people are on it!"
Monica  "Hi Im Rachel, is my sweater too tight? No? Oh, Id
better wash it and shrink it!"
Rachel  "Im Monica, I dont get phone messages from interesting
people. Ever!"
Phoebe  Hey! I call her!
Monica  "Oh my God, I love Ross! I hate Ross! I love Ross! I hate
Ross!"
Rachel  "Oh my God, I cant find a boyfriend! So I guess Ill
just stumble across the hall and sleep with the first guy I find in there!"
Phoebe  Yeah, we should get a move on if we wanna make those dinner
reservations. (Phoebe dumps a drawer full of makeup into a box.)
[Scene  Chandler and Joey's, Joey is examining the broken foosball table as Chandler
enters from his room.]
Chandler  Still broken?
Joey  This sucks man! The last night youre here and I lose the two most
important things in my life, the foosball table and $500.
Chandler  Well, there are other ways of winning back your money, how about a
little uh, a little Blackjack? (Holds up a deck of cards.)
Joey  Nah, not my game.
Chandler  Okay, uh, how about, how aboutyknow what? We could play a
new game. A new game, its fun.
Joey  Well, whats it called?
Chandler  Cups.
Joey  I dont know how to play Cups.
Chandler  Ill teach ya! Come on, come on, its really easy and
really, really fun.
Joey  All right.
Chandler  Okay, here you go. (He deals out two cards each.) I have two queens,
what do you have?
Joey  A two and a five.
Chandler  Ho-ho, you win! 50 dollars!
Joey  Really?!
Chandler  Oh yeah! Okay, lets play again. (He deals out two cards each
again.) What do you got?
Joey  A four and a nine.
Chandler  Youre kidding right?
Joey  No. Why?
Chandler  Well thats a full cup! (Pays him again.)
Joey  Damn! I am good at Cups!
[Scene  Monica and Rachel's, Monica is whining to Phoebe about Rachel.]
Monica  Im not talking to her!
Phoebe  Well, one of you has to take the first step! And it should be you,
because shes the one whos leaving. Its harder for her!
Monica  Well, maybe youre rightShe made fun of my phone pen!
Phoebe  I know, I took it hard too.
Monica  Listen Rachel, I feel really bad aboutWhat are you doing? (She
sees that Rachel is unpacking.)
Rachel  Im unpacking!
Monica  What?!
Rachel  Im not moving! (She re-hangs a picture, crookedly.) Is that
picture straight?
Monica  It needs to go about 20 blocks to the left!
Rachel  Hey, yknow what? Youre the one who wants to make this big
change and move in with Chandler! You should be the one to go! Why should I have to
leave?!
Monica  Because its my apartment!
Rachel  Well its mine too! What else you got?!
Monica  How about, youre moving!! (Grabs a bunch of clothes and throws
them into a box. What follows is a brief sequence of Rachel unpacking and Monica packing
the same stuff over and over again as Rachel chants "No." and Monica chants
"Yes.")
Rachel  Look! This is ridiculous. We should be packing you!! (She knocks over
Monica, grabs a box, and runs into the kitchen.)
Phoebe  Hey, how are you guys doing?
Rachel  Great! Monicas moving!
Monica  (entering) I am not!
Rachel  Oh really?! Then how come all your stuff is in this box?! (Monica starts
chasing Rachel around the table.)
Phoebe  Okay, you guys. You guys I think I know whats going on here. Okay,
you guys STOP!! (They stop.) I know that, I know that youre
acting mad because you think that itll make it easier to leave. But deep down
youre still really sad. Deep-deep down.
Monica  No Phoebe I am mad!
Phoebe  Well, deep-deep-deep down!
Rachel  Yeah, Im just mad!
Phoebe  Then keep running. (They resume the chase.)
[Scene  Chandler and Joey's, theyre still playing Cups.]
Chandler  You win.
Joey  Well, what did you have?
Chandler  It doesnt matter because nothing beats a three and a six. That
my friend is D-Cup. Okay, now much have you won so far?
Joey  Uh, (counts the money) wow, 700.
Chandler  Not 700 exactly?
Joey  Yeah.
Chandler  Double it! (He does.)
Joey  What?
Chandler  Well you see in Cups, once you get $700, you have to double it.
Joey  Really?
Chandler  Hey, I didnt make up the rules. Now, after you receive the
doubling bonus, you get uh, one card. Now that one card could be worth $100 bringing your
total to 1,500. (Joey gets excited.) Dont get to excited because thats not
gonna happen unless you getNo way! (He takes the top card, which is the two of
clubs. Of course, any card wouldve won. Chandler pays him.)
[Scene  Monica and Rachel's, Monica carries a box out of Rachels room.]
Monica  Well, this is the last box of your clothes. Im just gonna label
it, "What were you thinking?"
Rachel  Funny, because I was just gonna go across the hall and write that on
Chandler.
Phoebe  Hey you guys, I dont mean to make things worse, but umm, I
dont want to live with Rachel anymore.
Monica and Rachel 
Phoebe  Youre just so mean to each other! And I dont want to end up
like that with Rachel. I still like you!
Rachel  Well, Phoebe thats fine because Im not moving.
Monica  Whoa-whoa-whoa, Phoebe you gotta take her! Yknow I-I-I said some
really bad stuff about her, but yknow Rachel has some good qualities that
make her a good roommate.
Rachel  Oh really? Like what Monica?
Monica  Yknow she has 147,000 pairs of boots
Rachel  Oh yeah, good start Mon.
Monica  She lets you borrow them.
Rachel  Yeah and you stretch em out with your big old clown feet.
Monica  Do you wanna live outside?! Because its gettin cold! (To
Phoebe) She gets tons of catalogs and umm, shell fold down the pages of the things
she thinks that Id like.
Phoebe  What else?
Monica  When I take a shower, she leaves me little notes on the mirror.
Rachel  Yeah, I do. I-I do, do that.
Phoebe  Thats nice. I like having things to read in the bathroom.
Monica  When I fall asleep on the couch after reading, she covers me over with a
blanket.
Rachel  Well yknow, I dont want you to be cold.
Monica  And when I told her that I was gonna be moving in with Chandler, she was
really supportive. (To Rachel) (Starts to cry) You were so great. You made it so easy. And
now you have to leave. And I have to live with a boy!! (They both break down in tears.)
Rachel  Oh, its gonna be fine.
Phoebe  Okay Rachel, I cant wait to live with you! And you know
what we should do? Bring Monica and then we could all live there together! Well have
so much fun!!
Rachel  But honey, I think shes moving in with Chandler.
Phoebe  Oh thats right. Youre still set on that?
Monica  Kinda. (She hugs Phoebe and looks out the window. She moves closer to it
to get a better look.) Oh my God!
Ross  (answering the phone) Hello? (Listens) Hey Mon, hows the packing
going? (Listens) Ben? Hes fine. Yeah, hes rightOh my God! (He looks over
at the fake Ben and notices that the head has fallen off.) Get your head of your shirt
there son! (He tries to push the pumpkin through the neck hole.) What? (Listens) Yeah,
its a pumpkin. Ill come pack.
[Scene  Chandler and Joey's, (Ohh, thats the last time Im ever gonna type
that line. Its just so sad.) Joey is entering, angrily.]
Joey  Hey!
Chandler  Whats wrong?
Joey  Ross and I were helping the girls pack, took a little break, I lost $1,500
to him in Cups!
Chandler  Wh-How did you lose at Cups?!
Joey  The same way you lost. I started out with a King and a Queen, bamn! Ross
gets a 2 and a 3. Then I get a Jack and a King, boom! Ross gets a 4 and a 5! Ross was
getting the Cup card, the D-Cup, the Sittin Down Bonus! Meanwhile, I didnt
even get half a cup! Nothin!!
Chandler  Oh man!!
Joey  And he never played before either! Yknow what I think? I think
beginners luck, very important in Cups.
Chandler  All right, lets play one more hand! One more!
Joey  No, no, no more! I cannot lose another dime! Im serious this time!
In-in fact, look, theres aI wanna give you something. And let me give it too
you know before I pawn it for Cups money. (He rolls the big white dog over) Now, I want
you to have the big white dog as a kinda of a, yknow, thank you for being such a
great roommate.
Chandler  I cant take the big white dog! You love it!
Joey  Its him, not it!
Chandler  No, but waitwhat if I bought it from you, yknow? And your
nice gesture would be giving it to me at a reasonable price, say (Gets choked up) $1,500?
Joey  Wait a second, I see what youre trying to do here! You-youre
trying to give me money again!
Chandler  When did I try to give you money?
Joey  Over there! (Points to the couch) Before, with the bills! You tried to
give some charity, I said "No," you dropped it. Okay? Then we had a nice last
night together, we had some fun, we gambled, nobody tried to give anybody any money! Now
out of the blue, you start with the charity thing again!
Chandler  Im just trying to help you out! Okay? I wanna make sure that
youre okay.
Joey  I will be okay! Look Chandler, you gotta get it out of your head
that I cant take care of myself. Okay? Look, Im not gonna miss you helping me
out with money. The only thing that Im gonna missis you. And now the dog.
[Scene  Monica and Rachel's, (And thats the last time for that line, no more
Chandler and Joeys or Monica and Rachels, ever!) Joey and Ross are carrying
the last table of Rachels. Rachel follows slowly, but is stopped by Monica.]
Monica  Hey. Call me when you get there. Okay?
Rachel  Okay.
Monica  Im really gonna miss you.
Rachel  Oh! I have your key. Here you go. (Hands it to Monica.)
Monica  Thanks.
Rachel  Yeah.
Rachel  Oh God! This is silly, Im gonna see you in a couple of hours!
(They hug again.)
Monica  Yeah.
Rachel  Bye house!
Rachel  Bye Mon.
Monica  Bye.
Chandler  (entering) Hey.
Monica  She really left.
Chandler  I know. (He kisses her.)
Monica  Thank you.
Chandler  No problem roomie. (She turns around and hugs him.)
Monica  Can I ask you a question?
Chandler  Sure!
Monica  What the hell is that dog doing here?! (She notices the dog
sitting in the living room.)
[Scene  Rosss apartment, Chandler is trying to get Joeys money back from
Ross.]
Chandler  I invented the game of Cups as a way to give Joey money.
Ross  And now you want that money back.
Chandler  Exactly.
Ross  Chandler, what kind of an idiot do you take me for? (As he picks up the
fake Ben.)
Chandler  Its not a real game! I made it up!
Ross  Im sorry you lost your money, but I won it fair and square.
Chandler  At a fake game!!
Ross  Now, if you wanna try to make some of it back, Id be glad to play
you for it. But I should warn you, I am very good at Cups.
Chandler  Okay! Now I assume the Saucer card came up when you played last.
Ross  No.
Chandler  Hmm, lets see if it comes up this time. (He looks at his cards
and shrugs.)

[Scene  Phoebe and Rachels new apartment, Rachel and Phoebe are making their
answering machine message.]
Phoebe  Ready?
Rachel  Yeah.
Phoebe  Okay.
Rachel  Hi...
Phoebe  it's...
Rachel  Rachel...
Phoebe  and
Rachel  Phoebes...
Phoebe  please...
Rachel  leave...
Phoebe  leave
Rachel  Wait, I-I just said "leave."
Phoebe  Yeah, I know because you have all the good words. What do I get? I get
"its," "and" oh I'm sorry, I have "A." Forget it.
Rachel  Phoebe, come on that's silly.
Phoebe  All right, so let's switch.
Rachel  No, I have all of the good words. OK, fine, fine, we can switch.
Phoebe  Okay.
Rachel  Okay.
Phoebe  Hi
Rachel  Everybody
Phoebe  It's
Rachel  Rachel
Phoebe  and
Rachel  Phoebes
Phoebe  Please...wait, how did you do that?
Rachel  What?
Phoebe  Oh, you're no ordinary roommate are you?
Rachel  Phoebe, come on can we finish this later? Cause I wanna go running
before it gets dark. Oh! Why don't you come with me?!
Phoebe  Really?
Rachel  Yeah, it'll be fun. We'll run in the park. It'll be like our first
yknow roommate bonding thing.
Phoebe  Okay, let's go running!
Rachel  Yeah and there's really cute guys there.
Phoebe  Let's run towards them!
Rachel  OK!
Phoebe  All right, wait just one more second. Hi, it's Phoebe and Rachel's.
Please leave a message, thanks!
Rachel  Now wait a minute. You just took all the words!
Phoebe  Uh-huh. You've met your match Rachel Green.
[Scene  Monica and Chandlers new apartment, Ross and Chandler are there.]
Ross  So, I just finished this fascinating book. By the year 2030, there'll be
computers that can carry out the same amount of functions as an actual human brain. So
theoretically you could download your thoughts and memories into this computer and-and-and
live forever as a machine.
Chandler  (not amused) And I just realized I can sleep with my eyes open.
Monica  Hey!
Ross and Chandler 
Monica  (jumps over a box) Honey, that's a great idea nailing the boxes to the
floor!
Chandler  I didn't nail the boxes to the floor.
Monica  Oh, So you can move them!
Chandler  Yes, and while I'm doing that, Ross has a great computer story for
you.
Joey  Hey everybody! Uh, I'd like you to meet Janine. She's-she's gonna be my
new roommate!
Janine  Hi.
Ross  Hi! (Rushes over to shake her hand instantly.)
Janine  Hi
Joey  Yeah, she's gonna live with me!
Monica  It's nice to meet you. Janine...?
Janine  Lecroix. Janine Lecroix
Joey  I didn't know that! Well, what a pretty last name!
Chandler  So, uh, wh-where ya from?
Janine  Australia, I just moved here a couple of weeks ago.
Joey  (shocked) From the land down under? I didn't know that either!
Ross  So uh, wha-uh, what do you do?
Janine  I'm a dancer.
Joey  You're a dancer? She-she's a dancer!
Janine  Well, I think I'll go and unpack.
Joey  Oh, hey let me. (Opens the door for Janine and after he closes the door
behind her gasps ecstatically.)
Monica  Joey, did you even interview this woman before you asked her to move in?
Joey  Of course I did.
Monica  Uh-huh, what exactly did you ask her?
Joey  "When can you move in?"
Ross  Thank you for bringing her into our lives.
Chandler  Unbelievable
Monica  Oh, so you like her too Chandler?
Chandler  Hey, look at all the boxes!
Joey  Ugh, I cannot wait to ask her out!
Monica  Wait a minute...Joey. Joey you can't ask her out, she's your roommate.
It-it'll be way too complicated.
Ross  Yeah, yeah man don't do it. I mean if you date her, then-then-then I can't
date her.
Chandler  All right, think about it. Now remember when you were going out with
that girl Donna and you guys broke up. Remember how horrible it was when you guys bumped
into each other at the supermarket?
Joey  Oh God, yeah.
Chandler  Now imagine you live at the supermarket.
Joey  (happily) Okay!
Chandler  No-no
Joey  Oh, Oh, you're right! I don't want that. I can't date her!
Monica  Yeah and you better watch the flirting too, cause you know, in such
close quarters, it could be trouble.
Joey  Well, that's gonna be tough Mon. I mean it's hard for me to be around an
attractive woman and not flirt.
Monica  (chuckles) Hmm, well you're around me all the time and you don't flirt.
Joey  You a little sad about that sweetheart?
[Scene, The Park  Phoebe and Rachel are getting ready to go running]
Phoebe  I have to tie my shoe, so you go ahead, I'll catch up.
Rachel  Okay. (Runs off.)
Phoebe  Okay. (Starts running crazily with her arms flapping and her legs far
apart) Come on! That's not running! Let's go! (Rachel pauses, then follows, embarrassed.)
[Scene, Central Perk  Rachel, Ross and Monica are there]
Rachel  You guys, I'm telling you, when she runs, she looks like a cross between
Kermit The Frog and The Six Million Dollar Man.
Ross  Monica had such a crush on him. Yeah, she used to kiss his poster every
night before she went to bed.
Rachel  Oh! I used to do that too!
Monica  Did you also have his album, It's Not Easy Being Green?
Rachel  Aw, Mon...(Kisses her on the cheek)
Monica  So, Phoebe runs weird huh?
Rachel  Yeah, yeah and you know what, I know she's gonna wanna run again, I just
don't know how to get out of it, I mean, I live with her.
Monica  Why don't you just be straight with her? Tell her the truth.
Ross  Yeah.
Rachel  You're right, you're right. I should just tell her the truth.
Phoebe  Hey!
Ross  Hey!
Rachel  Pheebs, Monica tripped me, I don't think I can ever run again, ever!
Phoebe  Why? Why would you do that?
Monica  I don't know. Rachel I'm-I'm sorry that I hurt your ankles.
Rachel  Ankle.
Monica  We'll see.
[Scene  Monica and Chandlers new apartment, Chandler is putting something away
under the sink.]
Chandler  OK, I'm officially unpacked. Thanks for helping me man. (Turns around
and sees that Joey isn't there.) Joe? (Hears giggling coming from a box) Well, I guess
Joey went home. Oh and look, there's still one box that I have to unpack. (Hears the
giggling again)
Joey  (jumps out of the box) I Gotcha!!
Chandler  (pretending) Oh my God! You-almost-gave-me-a-heart-attack.
Joey  Boy, it was so hard not to laugh, I tell ya. Hey, hey, the place looks
great!
Chandler  Yeah, not bad right? You know what, Monicas gonna be working
late, so I'm gonna make this place spotless. You know what else I'm gonna do, know what
else I'm gonna do? I'm gonna go downstairs, I'm gonna get her some flowers. Now who
wouldn't wanna live with me?
Joey  (raises his hand) I don't! No, I wanna live with the super-hot Australian
dancer.
Chandler  Yeah, now how's that going though? Are you okay with the not-flirting
thing?
Joey  Yeah. Well, so far yeah. But it's tough you know? I got all this built up
flirting energy and I don't know how to get rid of it. (Gives Chandler the
"Joey-love," look.) How you doin?
Joey  (voice cracking) Ohhhh man
Janine  Sorry, there's just more room out here.
Joey  No-no-no-no-no, it's-it's uh, you just uh, uh reminded me that uh, I need
to do my stretches too. (Starts to stretch, groans painfully)
Janine  (touches his waist) Why don't you try to do-
Joey  (jumps up and yells)
Janine  What's wrong?
Joey  Uh-uh nothing. I-I-I-I didn't want you to touch me cause I'm -I'm all
sweaty from the workout. I better hit the shower. (Goes into the bathroom and comes back
out quickly) Oh my God!
Janine  Oh, sorry about that stuff hanging in there. It's just my
thongs are too delicate for the dryer.
Phoebe  (jumps in front of Rachel) Hi! Oh yeah, uh-huh, it's me. I saw you grab
your running shoes this morning and sneak out. You lied so you could run by yourself.
Rachel  No, no Phoebe no, I was...no. You know what, I was, I was actually just
checking to, see, if I could run. And I can!
Phoebe  Please Rachel, I am not an idiot. (Runs off)
Rachel  No, wait Phoebe.
Ross  (enters) Wow, couples who live together do start to look alike. So,
Mondler...uh, what uh, what cha doin?
Chandler  What does it look like I'm doing? I am cleaning!
Ross  Did you get Monica's authorization to move all of her stuff?
Chandler  Authorization? I don't need that. I'm gonna put everything back.
Ross  Put it back exactly where you found it?
Chandler  Yes I'm gonna put it back (Mocking Ross) exactly where I found
it.
Ross  Kay, first of all, this attitude is not helping.
Chandler  She's not gonna care if I put her stuff back in the same stupid place.
Ross  Whoa, hello, did you just meet Monica?
Chandler  She is gonna recognize that I did a nice thing and-and, appreciate it.
Ross  Hmm -you know, actually this'll work out well. Cause when you have to move
back in with Joey, Joey's hot new roommate can come and live with me.
Chandler  I see, I see, y-y-you're trying to freak me out.
Ross  Look Chandler, Monica is really weird about this kind stuff all right.
Believe me, I lived with her for 16 years. She is going to freakout. Oh my God,
she's going to sit on you.
Chandler  No, she's not okay? And I'll prove it to you. I'm gonna call her right
now. (Picks up the phone and wipes it off) Phone's done ehh.
Monica  (on phone) Hi!
Chandler  Hey Mon, how's it going?
Monica  Terrible. If-if I want something done right, I have to do it myself.
Other people just wreck stuff. I really think I might kill someone tonight.
Chandler  Oh come on, come on, it can't be that bad.
Monica  It's worse. The only thing that's getting me through is knowing that I'm
gonna be seeing you soon. I think I may even try to get out of here early.
Chandler  No! No-no-no-no-no-no. It sounds like they really need you down there.
Monica   Well, are you just hanging out with Ross?
Chandler  It's, all good! Okay bye-bye Mon! (To Ross) She's-she's gonna kill me.
Ross  Yeah, the phone was facing the other way. (Chandler fixes it and a picture
frame off the table.) And that goes back up there.
[Scene  Monica and Chandlers, continued from earlier.]
Chandler  We should start with the big stuff. Yknow? That'll be the
easiest. Uh, let's start with the couch. (He picks up one end and Ross doesn't help) I got
it. (He moves it back to where he thinks it goes.)
Ross  Yeah that-that, doesn't look right.
Chandler  What are you talking about? The couch is perfectly in line with the
carpet. And then I can just walk over here and casually just put my feet right up on
the...(Tries to rest his feet on the coffee table but they won't reach) OK, OK, here's
what we do, we just uh, move the couch closer to the coffee table.
Ross  Whoa, whoa, but then the back of the couch won't line up with he back of
the carpet.
Chandler  OK well here, we'll just move the coffee table closer to the couch.
Ross  Whoa, Whoa, Whoa, but then the coffee table won't be centered in the
seating area.
Chandler  Yes, but the coffee table doesn't match
the...blahebdmsdlkhdyslkd;btyds...Rooosss!!!!
Joey  (entering) Look, what am I gonna do? I'm not flirting but still, I'm
drawing her to me like - like a moth to a flame! (Tries to put his feet on the coffee
table...they won't reach and looks around.) What the hell's going on over here?!?!?
(Points to Chandler) Monica's gonna kill you! Look I need your help, I have to do
something to-to repel this woman! Wait a minute, wait a minute, you guys repel women all
the time.
Ross  Hey, I've been married 3 times
Joey  No-no-no I've seen it happen, you-you get a rapport going with a woman but
somehow you manage to kill it. What's your secret?
Ross  Look, we do not repel women OK? That is completely untrue.
Chandler  Oh no, yes we do my man. Remember when we were back in college and we
went to that spring dance and you walked right up to that girl you liked and you could not
stop talking about the Irish potato famine?
Ross  Yeah, well what about you? You weren't you know, so hot in college either.
After everything he said, he'd go "ba dum bum chessh"
Chandler  Yeah, Monica doesn't like that either, Maybe I should stop doing that.
Ross  Oh y'know what, girls don't like it when I start talking about science.
Chandler  That's not specific to girls.
Joey  This is great, this is great, what else, what else?
Ross  Uh, they don't like it when you correct their grammar.
Chandler  And they don't like it when you explain why your jokes are funny.
Ross  They don't like it when you keep asking them if they like you.
Chandler  Man, I'm so lucky I have Monica.
Ross  (nonchalantly) I'm never gonna find love again.
[Scene  Phoebe and Rachels, Rachel is there as Phoebe enters.]
Rachel  Hey Phoebe, can I talk to you for a second?
Phoebe  Sure
Rachel  Okay, um, I...(Phoebe walks into her room.) All right Phoebe look, I
just wanted to say that I'm sorry. OK? I handled the situation horribly and I should not
have lied to you.
Phoebe  So, what should you have done?
Rachel  Well, I-I should've told you the truth.
Phoebe  Uh-Huh, Which is...?
Rachel  Well, y'know, the reason I didn't wanna go running with you is because
um, well y'know the way that you run is a little...(Starts flapping her arms)
Phoebe  So?
Rachel  Well, it's embarrassing. People were looking at us like we were crazy.
Phoebe  Why do you care?
Rachel  Because they're people.
Phoebe  But people that you don't know and will never see again.
Rachel  Yes, but still. They're peoplewith eyes.
Phoebe  Well, I didn't get embarrassed running next to Miss (panting). But no,
okay. No, no, I can see why running with me would be embarrassing to you. Yeah, okay.
You're uptight.
Rachel  I-I am not uptightHey-hey-hey-oh-oh! Listen, I am not uptight,
man.
Phoebe  That's okay Rachel. I'm not judging you; that's just who you are. Me.
I'm more free y'know? I run like I did when I was a kid, cause that's the only way it's
fun. Y'know, I mean didnt you ever run so fast you thought your legs were gonna fall
off? Y'know, like when you were like running towards the swings or running away from
Satan? (Rachel looks confused) The neighbor's dog.
[Scene  Monica and Chandlers, Chandler has the tape measure out and is busy
lining up the lamp on the kitchen counter, Ross is supervising the whole operation.]
Chandler  Okay, is this lamp in the same place?
Ross  Who cares? I repel women.
Chandler  (blocks the door) No-no-no-no-no-no-no-no!!! You can't come in here!
R-r-r-r-Ross is naked.
Monica  What?!
Ross  (whispers) What?!
Chandler  (to Ross) I couldn't say that I was naked because she's allowed too
see me naked.
Ross  Why does anyone have to be naked?
Monica  Why is Ross naked?
Ross  I-I had to show Chandler something?
Monica  Naked?
Ross  Yeah-yeah I uh, I have a uh, a guy problem.
Monica  Is it the same thing that Chandler had?
Chandler  Look, uh, just come later, we'll get everything squared away and you
can come back later.
Monica  Okay, listen, there's still some of Chandler's medicine under the sink
in the bathroom. Bye!
Chandler  Bye! Thank God
Ross  Dude, what'd you have?
Chandler  Look, we have no time okay? We must focus. We gotta get everything
back into its original place.
Ross  (realizes something) The photo album! There were millions of pictures of
the apartment in the photo album. We just go through it and match everything to the
pictures.
Chandler  That's perfect! That's brilliant! (Starts going through the photo
album)
Ross  So really, what'd ya have?
[Scene  Joey and Janine's, Janine's there. Joey enters]
Janine  Hey Joey, I got some beer for you.
Joey  Uh, don't you mean "for whom?"
Janine  Sure, listen I was gonna order some pizza, you wanna share one?
Joey  Pizza, heh, its not like I never had that before...ba dum bum cheshhh.
Janine  Is there something wrong?
Joey  All right, All right, let's just get this out in the open okay? You're
hot. I'm lovable. Clearly there's a vibe going on between us. But, we're roommates and
it's a huge mistake for us to continue down this road.
Janine  Joey...
Joey  No, no, no, I'm telling ya. Imagine yourself living in a supermarket and
you will understand okay? So the question is, what do we do?
Janine  Well, I don't think there is anything to do. I mean I think you're
really sweet, but I'm just not interested in you like that.
Joey  Oh!
Janine  No! I mean you're a really nice guy and I'm happy to be your roommate
and your friend, I'm just y'know, I just don't feel that way about you.
Joey  Oh! I see what happened. It's because I was trying to repel you. Right?
Believe me, you'd feel a lot different if I turned it on.
Janine  I don't think so.
Joey  Oh, I do. (Gives her the Joey-love look.) How you doin?
Janine  I'm OK
Joey  What?!?!
Janine  What?
Joey  Oh dear God!
[Scene  The park, Rachel's running by herself and panting. After a little while she
decides to run like Phoebe.]
Rachel  (Runs into Phoebe.) Hey!
Phoebe  Hey!
Rachel  Oh honey, I'm so sorry, you were right, this feels great!
Phoebe  See? And you don't care if people are staring, it's just for a second
cause then you're gone!
Rachel  Gone! I mean its amazing Pheebs. I feel so free and so graceful. (Turns
and bumps into a mounted policeman and falls) Hey! Look out for the horse! Sorry! (Runs
off.)
[Scene  Monica and Chandlers, Chandler and Ross are there. Monica enters]
Monica  Is it okay for me to come in now?
Chandler  Uh-huh
Monica  Why is everything different?
Ross  Bye! (Runs out)
Chandler  No, I don't see anything different other than the fact that the room
got so much brighter when you came into it. (Forced laughter)
Monica  Well, the end table is wrong, The couch looks bizarre and don't even get
me started on the refrigerator magnets.
Chandler  Okay look, don't...don't be mad okay? But after I unpacked the boxes I
wanted to do something nice for you, so, I-I-I cleaned the apartment. So I moved
everything around and then I forgot where it, where it went back and I'm sorry, I'm very
sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
Monica  It's okay. Chandler, are you afraid of me or something?
Chandler  Do you want me to be afraid of you?
Monica  Of course not. I mean gosh, Chandler what you did, it's, it's a
wonderful thing and I really appreciate it. I know I have this weird thing where I want
everything to be in the perfect place, but I'd never expect you to worry about that.
Chandler  Really?
Monica  Of course!
Chandler  Oh well you're the best. You come here to me.
Monica  All right, hold on okay? First thing's first. (Gets her cleaning gloves
on) Okay, now did Ross sit anywhere while he was naked?
[Scene  Central Perk, Ross, Janine and Chandler are there]
Ross  So it said that by the year 2030, there'll be computers that can carry out
the same number of functions as an actual human brain. So theoretically we could download
our thoughts and our memories into this computer...
Janine  ...and live forever as a machine!
Ross  That's so Janine, you-you-you know what, do you know we're doing right
now? You and I, we're interfacing.
Janine  Yeah, I gotta go.
Chandler  Ba dum bumb cheshhh!

assuming mashed potatoes) in a bowl.]
Monica  (on phone) Okay, great!  Bye. (Hangs up as Chandler enters.) So
guess whos coming to Thanksgiving dinner?
Chandler  Sydney Portier? Hehheh.
Monica  (not amused by Chandlers joke) I miss Rachel. (To Chandler) No, my
parents.
Chandler  Oh! Thats great, they havent seen the place since I moved
in!
Monica  Yeah, and yknow, if you could not mention to them that we live
together, that would be great! (Quickly trying to change subjects), I was thinking we
would eat around four.
Chandler  (shocked at the news) Why cant I tell them that we live
together?
Monica  Because they dont know were dating. (Again, trying to
quickly change subjects.) Do you think we should eat in the kitchen? (Goes to the sink and
the stove to cook.)
Chandler  Why havent you told them?!
Monica  Um, well, I was going to, I-I-I really was. But um, then somewhere, just
out of nowhere, I didnt.
Chandler  Why havent you told them?! Wouldnt they be happy?!
Monica  (trying to change subjects, excitedly) So! Dinner in the kitchen around
four! Ill see you then. (Pats Chandler on the shoulder and goes into the living
room.)
Chandler  Why wouldnt they be happy?
Monica  Well, um, because mainly, um, they dont like you. Im sorry.
Chandler  What? What? Why?!
Monica  Maybe because you used to be aloof, or that youre really
sarcastic, or that, yknow, you joke around all the time. Or that you take off your
clothes and throw them on the couch.
Chandler  Is this why they dont like me or why you dont like me?
Monica  Look, I know that I shouldve told them. I know I shouldnt
care what they think. Im sorry.
Chandler  Yknow, itll be okay. Itll be okay. Because when they
come over, I will be all charming, I will make them fall in love with me, and then
well tell em.
Monica  You really think thatll work?
Chandler  Hey, I can be pretty charming, babe, I won YOU over, didnt I?
Monica  (hugging Chandler) I dont think youll ever get my parents
that drunk!
[Scene  Joey and Janines, Joey and Ross are playing Sony Playstation.
Chandler enters.]
Chandler  Hey! (Sees Ross is there) Oh, good, Ross! Youre parents like me,
right?
Ross  (only half-paying attention) Yes, of course they like you!
Chandler  Well Monica just told me that they dont.
Ross  (not paying attention) Yeah, they dont like you.
Chandler  (annoyed) Do you know why?
Ross  I dunno, maybe its because youre really sarcastic. Or maybe
its cause you uh-
Chandler  (angry) Well if people dont know they shouldnt just guess!
Chandler  This is great, another Thanksgiving with nothing to give thanks for.
Joey  Maybe I could give thanks for you shuttin up, eh?
Chandler  Maybe I could give thanks by taking my Playstation over to my
new apartment.
Joey  Well maybe I love ya.
Chandler  [mocks that last comment].
Janine [to Chandler]  Hey.
Chandler  Hey.
Janine  Hey guys!
Ross  (trying to act manly in front of Janine) No I dont want to
play video games, Joey!
Janine  Are you guys going to Chandlers for Thanksgiving?
Joey  Yeah! Yeah, why? Whats up?
Janine  Well, me and my dancer friends are thinking of doing Thanksgiving
uptown. I thought you guys might like to come.
Ross  For real?
Janine  No, but you should go to Chandlers. Because none of us knows how
to cook, well probably just end up drinking all day.
Joey  Ye-ye, we go to yours!
Ross  Yeah, see, we-we-we have to stop across the hall, because its my
sister. But, uh, uh yknow actually, growing up with a sister was nice because it
really helped me understand women. Yeah, you-you should tell your friends that.
Janine  (not sure of what to make of that) Okay.
Joey  How you got three women to marry you, Ill never know.
[Scene  Monica and Chandlers, Phoebe enters with a paper turkey.]
Phoebe  Hey!
All  Hey!
Rachel  Hey! Hey, Pheebs, check it out. Yeah, for my desert, I have chosen to
make a traditional English truffle!
Phoebe  Wow, that sounds great! And what are you making Monica, in case
Rachels dessert is...[about to say bad] so good that I eat all of it.
Theres none left for anybody else!
Monica  Nothing.
Rachel  (worried) Nothing?
Monica  No, sweetie, I-I trust you.
Rachel  So, if-if I mess this up, theres nothing else for dessert?
Monica  Youre not gonna mess it up.
Rachel  Wow, Monica, I love that, you really have faith in me. Thank you.
Technical question, how do you know when uh, the butters done?
Monica  Well, its done about two minutes before it looks like that.
Joey and Ross  Hey!
All  Hey!
Joey  Oh, ooh the food smells great, Mon!
Ross  And the place looks so nice!
Joey  Yeah, hey hey, Happy Thanksgiving everybody!
Ross  Happy Thanksgiving!
The Girls  Happy Thanksgiving!
Joey  Well, this has been great!
Ross  See ya!
Monica  Whoa whoa whoa! Wherere you goin?
Ross  Oh, oh, we did say wed stop by this little thing Joeys
roommate is having.
Monica  Oh, Janine, the really hot dancer girl?
Ross  Some would say shes attractive, yes.
Phoebe  And who else is going to be there?
Joey  Uh, some of her friends, yeah.
Rachel  Her dancer friends?
Joey  (frustrated) Yes, all right? All of her hot dancer friends are gonna be
there and theyre gonna be, be drinkin and dancin, and we really wanna go!
Ross  (to Joey) Dude, we were good!
Monica  Youre not gonna go anywhere, you said you were gonna eat here, and
youre gonna eat here!
Phoebe  Yeah, and-and leaving us to go see hot dancer girls is not very
Thanksgivingy.
Ross  Oh, but-but it is, uh, its just like the first Thanksgiving, when
the Indians and the Pilgrims uh, sat down to dinner.
Joey  Yeah, yeah, and the Indians taught the Pilgrims what it meant to be hot in
the new world!
Mrs. Geller  Hello everybody!
Mr. Geller  Hi!
All  Hi!
Monica  Dad [kisses Jack], Mom [kisses Judy]. Look! Look who it is its
Chandler!
Mrs. Geller  (less than pleased) Oh yes of course, hello Chandler.
Chandler  Mr. and Mrs. Geller, you look wonderful, it is great to have you hear,
let us take off your coats!
Chandler  Whoa, snowing out there?
Mr. Geller  (angry) No.
Mr. Geller  Monica, all this food looks wonderful, you should think about doing
this for a living.
Mr. Geller  Ok, I have dandruff. Theres no need to laugh and point.
Monica  Dad, Chandler was just laughing at your joke.
Mr. Geller  My joke wasnt funny.
Phoebe  Rach, Rach, I just remembered. I had a dream about Mr. Geller last
night.
Rachel  Really?!
Phoebe  Yeah, I dreamt that he saved me from a burning building and he was so
brave and so strong! And its making me look at him totally differently. Yknow,
I mean he used to be just, yknow Jack Geller Monica and Rosss dad
and now hes hes Jack Geller, dream hunk."
Rachel  I dunno. Yknow to me hell always be Jack Geller, walks
in while youre changing.
Monica  Yknow dad, Chandler is one of Rosss very best friends!
Chandler  Yeah, Ross sure is a great guy, yknow Ive always felt that
how a young man turns out is a reflection on his father.
Mr. Geller  I always thought that too. Tell me, what does your father do?
Chandler  (worried) Hes the headliner of a gay burlesque show.
Joey  Rach, youre killin us here, will ya serve the dessert already?
Those drunken dancers are waiting!
Rachel  (looking at her truffle) Look at it, isnt it beautiful?
Ross  Yeah, yeah, what is it?
Rachel  Its a truffle. Its got all of these layers. First
theres a layer of ladyfingers, then a layer of jam, then custard, which I made from
scratch, [Joey and Ross make impressed faces] then raspberries, more ladyfingers, then
beef sauteed with peas and onions, [Joey and Ross look like somethings wrong.] then
a little more custard, and then bananas, and then I just put some whipped cream on top!
Ross  W-What was the one right before bananas?
Rachel  The beef? Yeah, that was weird to me, too. But then, yknow, I
thought well, theres mincemeat pie, I mean thats an English
dessert, these people just put very strange things in their food, yknow. [To Joey]
Oh! by the way, can I borrow some Rum from your place?
Joey  Y-sure!
Rachel  (teasingly) And while Im gone dont you boys sneak
a taste.
Joey and Ross  (faking dissapointment) Okay.
Ross  Beef in a dessert?! I- no no no, there is no way!
Joey  I know, and only one layer of jam?! What is up with that?
Ross  Oh my God, the pages are stuck together!
Joey  (turning to Chandler in a scolding tone) Chandler!
Ross  Oh My God, she-she made half a English Trifle, and half a...Sheperds
Pie!
Joey  (sad) Oh man! Now shes gonna start all over! Were never gonna
get to introduce the hot girls to the new world!
Ross  No, no, we will. We just wont tell her she messed up.
Joey  Just let her serve the beef-custard thing?
Ross  Yeah, itll be like a funny Thanksgiving story!
Joey  (shrugging his shoulders to go along with it) Vomiting stories are
funny...
Rachel  Joey, God, your apartment is like a hundred degrees!
Joey  Did-did it make you wanna walk around in your underwear?
Rachel  No!
Joey  (frustrated) Still not hot enough!
Phoebe  Rachel?
Rachel  Yeah?
Phoebe  Okay, look at him. Look at those strong hands. Oh what I wouldnt
give to be that can of (looks closer to see what Jack is drinking) condensed milk.
Monica  Mom, uh, Chandler was just saying how beautiful your sweater is.
Mrs. Geller  Oh, thank you Chandler! I just bought it.
Chandler  Oh, yes. Well its very beautiful. Its cream-colored and
tight [Realizes what he just said and looks worried. Monica and Ross also looked shocked.
Judy and Jack give Chandler a very dirty look.] I dont mean tight, I mean its
not too tight, not that I was looking at-[giving up all hope, he puts his head into his
hands.]
Mr. Geller  Whats the matter with him?
Mrs. Geller  (whispers to Jack a little loudly) I think hes stoned again.
Chandler  (shocked) What?
Monica  (shocked) What?
Ross  (worried) Dude, I need to talk to you a sec.
[Scene  Rachels old room. Its pretty much empty except for a few boxes
against the walls. Ross and Chandler enter.]
Ross  Okay, I think I might know why my parents dont like you.
Chandler  You do? Why?
Ross  Okay, remember, we were young. Hey, Spring break, sophomore year, I got
high in my bedroom and my parents walked in and smelled it and so I told them that you had
gotten stoned and jumped out the window.
Chandler  What?! Why did you do that?
Ross  I dont know, aheh, yours was the first name that-that popped
into my head, Im Im sorry. I-I didnt think it would matter.
Chandler  How could it not matter?!
Ross  How was I supposed to know wed end up being friends after college,
let alone you-you would be living with my sister?
Chandler  What about all that friends forever stuff?
Ross  I dont know, I-I was all high.
[Scene  Rachels Old Bedroom, Continued from earlier. Monica enters the room.]
Monica  Mom and dad just sent me in here to find out if you (points to Chandler)
were trying to get Ross stoned!
Chandler  Your parents caught Ross smoking pot in college and he blamed it on
me!
Monica  Ross, I cant believe youd do that!
Chandler  The reason we havent told them were together is because
they hate me, okay? So will you fix this?
Ross  Okay, okay, Ill tell em it wasnt Chandler who got high.
Now who should I say it was?
Monica  You! Its not like its a big deal! You-you dont still
do it or anything!
Ross  Alright, alright, now-now who should I say tricked me into doing it?
[Scene  Monica and Chandlers, Time lapse. Jack is still on the couch, picking his
teeth with his feet on the table. Phoebe and Judy are sitting on the table looking at him.
Ross and Chandler are sitting by the window talking. Rachel and Joey are in the kitchen
fooling with Rachels trifle. Monica walks into the living room from the kitchen.]
Monica  Dad, please dont pick your teeth out here! Alright, and if
youre gonna put your feet up, why dont you sit on the-
Phoebe  Monica, leave him alone!
Joey  (to Rachel) Will you hurry up? Did you not hear me before when I told you
that all of Janines friends are dancers?! And that theyre going to be drinking
alot!?
Rachel  (sarcastically) No, I did, but tell me again, because its so
romantic.
Joey  Well youre whippin so slow! Cant you do it any faster?
Rachel  Joey! Come on! I dont wanna make any mistakes, alright? This is
the only dessert and if I screw it up everybody's gonna be like Oh, remember that
Thanksgiving when Rachel screwed up the trifle?
Rachel  So why dont you just let me worry about making the trifle and you
just worry about eating it, alright?
Joey  Oh I am!
Monica  Ross, if you dont tell them, then I will!
Ross  Okay, fine!
Joey  Ross! Can I talk to you for a second?
Ross  Oh, uh, can it wait a second Joey? I have to tell my parents something. No
it cant? Okay.
[Scene  Rachels old room, Ross and Joey enter.]
Joey  Okay, look, I think we have to tell Rachel she messed up her dessert.
Ross  What?! What is with everybody? Its Thanksgiving, not...Truth-Day!
Joey  Look, when everyone eats that...that...Banana-Meat thing, theyre all
gonna make fun of her, do you want that?
Ross  Okay, okay, well just get everyone to act like they like it.
That-that way noone makes fun of her and we still get to go to Sweet Potatoe Pie!
(Referring to the dancers.)
Joey  (scolding) Dude, theyre not objects.
Joey  Just kiddin, Ill talk to them, you distract Rach.
Ross  Hey Rach, can I talk to you outside for a second?
Rachel  Okay...
Rachel  Whats up, Ross?
Ross  So um...Thanksgiving. The holiday season is upon us, hm?
Rachel  Yeah!
Ross  And um...You look nice today.
Rachel  Oh no. No Ross, dont do this.
Ross  What?
Rachel  I just- I dont think us getting back together is a good idea.
Ross  (shocked) Eh?
Rachel  I thought this might happen today. Ross, I know the holidays can be
rough. Yknow? And its probably really hard for you to be alone right now.
Ross  (cutting her off) Youre alone.
Rachel  No, I-I live with Phoebe. I mean youre [pity-tone] alone,
alone. And I just-its just not the time for us. Im sorry.
Ross  (just trying to get out of the conversation) Ah well, cant blame a
guy for trying!
Joey  Oh and (Ross begins to open the door and Joey says some gibberish word to
indicate to Ross that hes not done yet. Ross closes the door again.) Okay, and uh if
anyone needs help pretending to like it, I learned something in acting class, try uh,
rubbing your stomach (Rubs his stomach) or uh, or saying mmm and uh, oh oh!
And smiling (Smiles while pretending to stir a bowl), okay?
Chandler  Yeah, Im not gonna pay for those acting classes anymore.
Joey  Rachel, there you are! Come on, lets serve that dessert already!
Rachel  Joey, youre gonna have to stop rushing me, you know what? You
dont get any dessert.
Joey  (happily) Really?
Rachel  No, Im just kidding I would never do that to you! Okay, everybody,
its trifle time!
Phoebe  So, now, Rach, this is a traditional English trifle, isnt it?
Rachel  It sure is.
Phoebe  Wow. So then did you make it with beef or Eggplant?
Rachel  Beef.
Phoebe  I cant have any. You know I dont eat meat. (Faking
dissapointment.) Ohhh no.
Rachel  Alright, Monica, I want you to have the first taste.
Monica  Really?
Rachel  Oh oh oh, wait! You only got whipped cream in there! Ya gotta take a
bite with all the layers!
Monica  Okay.
Rachel  Op! Wait, you dropped a pea.
Rachel  Well?
Monica  (faking joy. Rubbing her stomach and smiling at the same time, like Joey
said) Mmmm! Its good!
Rachel  Really? How good?
Monica  Its so good, that I feel really selfish about being the only one
whos eating it, that I think we should have everyone taste how good it is.
Especially Ross.
All  (faking enjoyment) Mmm.
Chandler  (clearly lying and hating the dessert) Yeah, this is so good, that
Im gonna go enjoy it on the balcony so that I can enjoy the view whilst I enjoy my
dessert.
Mrs. Geller  (lying) Ive gotta call my friend Mary and tell her how good
this is, from Monicas room.
Mr. Geller  (also lying) Ill help you dial.
Monica  (again, lying) Im gonna go into the bathroom so I can look at it
in the mirror, as I eat it.
Rachel  Okay, now what was that all about? Is it-does it not taste good? Let me
try it.
Ross  Wha? No no! Ah! (Ross scarfs all of his trifle down in about a second. He
looks like hes going to throw up.) (Lying) All gone! So good! Maybe Chandler has
some left.
Ross  It tastes like feet!
Joey  I like it.
Ross  Are you kidding?
Joey  Whats not to like? Custard? Good. Jam? Good. Meat? Gooooood.
Rachel  ...So a bird just grabbed it, and then tried to fly away with it and,
and then just dropped it on the street?
Chandler  (lying) Yes, but if its any consolation, before the bird dropped
it, he seemed to enjoy it.
Phoebe  Rachel, come here. (Rachel walks over to Phoebe. Chandler sits down on
the lounge-chair.) Okay, I was just starting to take my Thanksgiving nap, and I had
another dream about Jack.
Rachel  Oh, Phoebe, do I wanna hear this?
Phoebe  I dunno, lets see! So, okay, I dreamt that we were gonna get
married, and he left, becuz he had to go fight a fire. And, um, so okay, I went to a night
club, and I saw him making out with a girl.
Rachel  (humoring Phoebe) Oh my God, he dream-cheated on you!
Phoebe  Yeah, but then Jacques Cousteau came and he kicked his ass for betraying
me! It was soo cool! Then, he took me diving and he introduced me to his pet seahorse,
who, by the way, was totally coming on to me, and please, that is not gonna happen.
Mr. Geller  Boy, Im glad I wore the big belt today.
Phoebe  Five minutes ago, a line like that wouldve floored me. Now
nothing. Well, not nothing, I am still a woman.
Monica  Ross? Lets go.
Ross  Oh yeah, about telling Mom and Dad, I was thinking about maybe writing a
letter.
Monica  Alright, you know what? Thats it. Youve had your chance.
Ross  Wha-what?
Monica  (out loud, to her parents) Mom! Dad! Ross smoked pot in college!
Mr. and Mrs. Geller  What?!
Ross  (in a 5 year olds tone) (To Monica) You are such a tattletale! Mom,
Dad, you remember that-that time you walked in my room and smelled marijuana?
Mr. and Mrs. Geller  Yes. (They look at Chandler angrily.)
Ross  Well I told you it was Chandler who was smoking the pot but it was me.
Im sorry.
Mrs. Geller  It was you?
Monica  And Dad, yknow that mailman that you got fired? He didnt
steal your Playboys! Ross did!
Ross  Yeah, well, Hurricane Gloria didnt break the porch swing, Monica
did!
Monica  Ross hasnt worked at the museum for a year!
Ross  Monica and Chandler are living together!
Monica  Ross married Rachel in Vegas! And got divorced! Again!!!!
Phoebe  (joining in) I love Jacques Cousteau!
Rachel  (reading the recipe magazine, finally figuring out that...) I
wasnt supposed to put beef in the trifle!
Joey  (pounding the table) I wanna gooooooo!
Mrs. Geller  (rubbing her temples) Thats alot of information to get in in
thirty seconds! Alright Joey, if wanna leave, just leave. Rachel, no you werent
supposed to put beef in the trifle. It did not taste good. Phoebe, Im sorry, but I
think Jacques Cousteau is dead. (Phoebe makes a sad face.) Monica, why you felt you had to
hide the fact that you were in an important relationship is beyond me.
Mr. Geller  And we kinda figured about the porch swing.
Mrs. Geller  Ross, drugs? Divorced? Again?
Mr. Geller  What happened son?
Ross  I-I uh, I got tricked into all those things!
Mrs. Geller  Chandler! Youve been Rosss best friend all these years,
stuck by him during the drug problems. (Ross gets disgusted.) And now youve taken on
Monica as well. Well, I dont know what to say. Youre a wonderful human being.
Chandler  Thank you!
Mr. Geller  No! Thank you! (Hugs Chandler) Monica, and Ross! I dont know
what Im gonna do about the two of you!
Chandler  (In a parent-like tone) Ill talk to them!
[Scene  Monica and Chandlers, Everyone is helping clean the table.]
Rachel  You guys! It was bananas, cream, and beef! I-I just cannot believe that
you ate that so that I wouldnt feel bad!
Monica  Well actually, I-I didnt eat mine. Its still in the
bathroom.
Joey  No it isnt, I ate that.
Mrs. Geller  (pointing to herself and Jack) Well we left ours in Monicas
bedroom.
Joey  Nope, got it and I got yours (Pointing to Jack) too.
[Scene  Monica and Chandlers apartment, everyone except Ross is decorating the
tree.]
Chandler  Let me ask you, why is everybody using these tiny lights nowadays? I
remember when people used to use big lights.
Rachel  Thats a good story, Grandpa.
Ross  Hey
All  Hey
Ross  Wow, Monicas letting other people help decorate her tree! Did
someone get her drunk again or?
Monica  Having a perfectly decorated tree is not what Christmas is about.
Its about being with the people that you love.
Phoebe  That is nice and were done. TADA!
Chandler  I dunno what it is, it just doesnt quite feel like Christmas to
me.
Monica  Oh, here.
Chandler  See now it feels like Christmas!
[Scene  Central Perk, everyone except Phoebe and Joey are there.]
Ross   and thats the story of the dreidle. Now, some people
trace the Christmas tree back to the Egyptians, who used to bring green palm branches into
their huts on the shortest day of the year, symbolising lifes triumph over death.
And that was like 4000 years ago.
Rachel  So, pretty much around the same time that you started telling this
story.
Joey  Hey you guys.
Chandler  Hey Joe whats up?
Joey  I had to get out of the apartment. Janine is like stretching all over the
place. Yknow, everywhere I look shes like (He imitates her stretching)
Chandler  I can see why thats hard to resist.
Joey  I like her so much!
Monica  Aw, Im sorry sweetie that she doesnt feel the same way.
Joey  I know. And shes so sweet. I just wanna feed her grapes and brush
her hair.
Chandler  You are aware that shes not a monkey, right?
Ross  I am so over Janine. I mean, yeah, at first I thought she was hot,
but now shes like OLD NEWS!
Janine  Hey guys!
Ross  Hi Janine!
Janine  I just got a call to be a dancer on a television special for New
Years Eve. Its called some sort of Dickn Rockn Dickie Eve.
Monica  Hold it! Are you talking about Dick Clarks New Years
Rocking Eve?
Janine  Yeah, thats what I said.
Monica  Oh my God! We love that show! I mean Ross and I have been watching it
since I can remember!
Chandler  Ah, youre still just a little fat girl inside arent you?
(He kisses her on the cheek)
Janine  Well Im gonna be on it this year. Im gonna be one of the
party people.
Ross  Youre gonna be a party person! Those guys rock the most!
Janine  Well they said I should bring someone. (To Joey) Do you wanna be my
dance partner?
Joey  Totally! I would love to spend New Years with you.
Janine  Well actually theyre taping tomorrow. I dont really
understand why.
Ross  Oh, well you see how it works is, the part with Dick Clark in Times
Square is actually live, but they tape some of the party stuff ahead of time. Yeah, not a
lot of people know that.
Janine  Yeah well, do you guys wanna come too?
Ross  Are you serious?
Monica  We are there!
Chandler  What, what are you laughing at?
Rachel  Well, I used to date him, but youre still going out with her!
Janine  Thanks. (To Monica and Ross) Great so we can all go together! I gotta
run. Catch you later!
All  Bye!
Ross  Bye Janine!
Joey  Did she just ask me out on a date?
Chandler  I dont think so.
Monica  What are you talking about? She just invited him to the biggest party of
the millennium!
Rachel  Yeah, but she also invited you and Ross. Yeah, honey, Im sorry,
but I dont think that was a romantic thing.
Joey  Oh. Maybe. But hey I know how I can find out. Were going to a New
Years Eve party, right? So at midnight, I can kiss her. And if she kisses me back,
great! Yknow? But if she says Dude, what the hell are you doing? I can
say It wasnt me, it was New Years!
Rachel  Well, thats a lot better than Ross trying to kiss me in High
School, and saying that he did it because he needed chapstick.
Ross  It was a dry day.
Monica  We are going to Dick Clarks New Years Rocking Eve!
Ross  Oh my God!
Monica  Oh my God!
Chandler  (To Rachel) Oh my God!
[Scene  The Set, Joey, Janine, Ross and Monica are walking in.]
Joey  OK, listen Ive been on sets before, so let me give you a little
advice, alright? Its a show, but were just dancing, OK? Its no big deal.
The important thing to remember  stay cool.
Ross  Got it!
Ross  Oh my God its just like I dreamed it!
Director  OK, everyone gather up.
Monica and Ross  Scuse us
Director  Heres whats gonna happen. The musics gonna start,
youre gonna dance, were gonna tape, you dont look at the camera. Any
questions?
Ross  Yeah, I have a question. When is this gonna air?
Director  Uh, yeah. Now you guys dance over there, you guys over there, and I
want you two right around here, and everyone else spread out.
Joey  Ross! So when is it gonna air?
[Scene  Monica and Chandlers apartment, Chandler is there. Phoebe and Rachel
enter.]
Rachel  Okay, you look in the kitchen, I will look in the back closet.
Chandler  I can save you time ladies, Im right here.
Phoebe  Yeah, Chandler why dont you take a walk? This doesnt concern
you.
Rachel  We are looking for our Christmas presents from Monica.
Chandler  What? Thats terrible!
Phoebe  No-no, we do it every year!
Chandler  Oh well, that makes it not terrible.
Phoebe  No, yeah, we never find them! Shes always best at us that wily
minx.
Rachel  Dont worry, were just gonna search here for an hour, them
were gonna go over to Joeys and search, OK?
Chandler  No not okay, you cant look for Monicas presents!
Phoebe  But we have to!
Chandler  No, you dont have to, and you cant because I live here
too.
Phoebe  Well then, you should look with us.
Chandler  Why?
Rachel  Chandler, arent you worried about what to get Monica for
Christmas?
Chandler  No, I have a great idea for a present for her.
Phoebe  Oh, thats it? (Mimics Chandler) A great idea!
Rachel  Chandler, thats not enough. I mean what if she gets you a great
present, two medium presents, and a bunch of little presents? And youve just gotten
her one great present? I mean thats just gonna make her feel bad. Why would you do
that to her Chandler? Why? Why?
Chandler  If I help, we can find em faster!
Rachel  Thats right!
Phoebe  Ooh ooh, we have a live one!
Rachel  Oh, its a Macys bag!
Phoebe  Ooh, whos it for?
Rachel  (Reading) Dear losers, do you really think Id hide
presents under the couch? P.S. Chandler, I knew theyd break you.
Phoebe  Uh-oh. She may be onto us.
Rachel  We are so gonna find them this year.
Chandler  Yknow when you guys said you were gonna go across the hall and
look, you dont, you dont do that every year do you?
Rachel  Yeah.
Chandler  You dont, like go into the back of my closet, and look under my
gym bag or anything?
Phoebe and Rachel  No, we never do that
Chandler  Because thats where Joey gave me some stuff to store that
Ive never seen before in my life! Okay, that did not just happen! (He does a weird
clicky motion with his fingers, that kinda hard to describe.)
[Scene  The Set, everyone is dancing.]
Monica  Okay, here comes another camera.
Ross  Right. No biggie. Stay loose.
Ross  Why do they keep doing that?
Monica  If we wanna get on camera, I think we have to get up on one of those
platforms. Theyve been taping those people up there all day.
Ross  Right.
Ross  Hey, whatd you guys do to get up on there?
Girl  We learned how to dance.
Monica  Oh yeah? Well when you learned how to dance did you forget how to put on
underpants?
Ross  Yeah!
Janine  Hey! Youre a good dancer!
Joey  Really?
Janine  Yeah, well youd be better if you just loosened your hips a little.
Joey  What do you mean?
Janine  Like this.
Janine  Thats it, feel the rhythm. Thats better.
Joey  Uh-huh.
Director  (To Joey) Okay, youre dancing with that girl over there.
Joey  No-no-no-no-no we came together!
Director  I dont see it. (To Janine) You are dancing with the tall guy
over there. Tall guy, raise your hand! (He does. Janine goes over to him.)
Joey  No-no hey buddy, please let me dance with that girl, I really like her and
I think I have a shot.
Director  Really, ythink so? I dont..
[Scene  Monica and Chandler's apartment, Phoebe and Rachel are there and Chandler
enters.]
Chandler  I couldn't find anything at Joey--Hey-hey, oh hey!
Rachel  Yeah, we found them. There were in the guest room closet behind some
coats.
Phoebe  Yeah, and you have nothing to worry about 'cos they're all crap!
Chandler  Those are my gifts, I got them for you.
Phoebe  Ohhh. Thanks Chandler they're great!
Rachel  Well Chandler, what is this very weird, metal A Z thing?
Chandler  Those are book ends! That's a great gift!
Phoebe  Oh, okay, I'm sorry, thank you for my azzz.
Rachel  Ha!
Chandler  Make sure you put all that stuff back in the closet, okay?
Rachel  Yes, okay, oh, by the way, I just gotta say, I think it's really nice of
you that even after you've moved, you still keep storing that stuff for Joey!
[Scene  The Set, the girl is still dancing with Joey.]
Joey  Hey-hey dancer girl! Can I go to the bathroom? I just.. (The girl starts
dancing really close to him, so he picks her up, twirls her round, and puts her against a
platform) Here we go. (He walks away to find Monica and Ross doing a really out of place
dance) Looking good Gellers!
Ross  We know!
Monica  Hey, see that snippy guy over there? Hes the one who decides who
gets up on the platform. We should go dance by him.
Ross  Okay.
Director  Okay, everybody hold!
Director  Next on the platforms are (He points to the right of Ross and
Monica, so they dance over to where hes pointing to. He points away from them)
you two! And (He points the other way, and Ross and Monica follow his arm.
Again he points away.) You two!
Monica  Excuse me, sir, would it help if I werent wearing underpants?
Ross  Monica! (Pause) Would it?
[Scene  The Mens Bathroom, the tall guy is there as Joey enters.]
Joey  Hey! Tall guy! Hey, listen, I wanted to talk to you about that girl that
youre dancing with.
Tall Guy  Shes nice, huh? To think I almost brought my wife to
this!
Joey  Yeah, yeah, okay. Uh, look buddy, I came with that girl, and I had this
plan to kiss her at the new years countdown  Im trying to win her over, so I
was wondering if..
Tall Guy  No I dont think so.
Joey  Oh come on man, you can dance with my partner, shes real, uh,
mellow!
Tall Guy  Look, are you dating this girl you came with?
Joey  Well, I was hoping after tonight that maybe I could you know
Tall Guy  No, no. Shes fair game if you ask me, sorry buddy!
Joey  Alright, alright, hey yknow fair is fair, (he pretends to wash his
hands) if youre right, youre right, what can I say, but hey oh no! (He throws
water on the guys pants)
Tall Guy  God! What are you, in second grade?
Joey  Hey, now youre the one who wet his pants. (He throws another handful
on him and runs out)
[Scene  The Set, Monica and Ross are dancing.]
Monica  Man, this sucks! Yknow if Mom and Dad dont see us on TV
after we made them so jealous, I mean, whos gonna be the losers then?
Ross  Hey, I know whatll get us up on a platform!
Monica  What?
Ross  The routine!
Monica  Ross, we havent done the routine since middle school.
Ross  Hey, when the snippy guy sees the routine, hell wanna build
us our own platform!
Monica  Was it really that good?
Ross  We got honourable mention in the brother/sister dance category!
Look, its almost fake midnight, do we really have any other choice?
Monica  Okay, lets do it. Mom and Dad are gonna be so faced!
Monica  5 6 7 8!
Ross  So, do we really have to ask whos going up on the platform
next?
Director  Oh no! You get up there and do that again exactly like that!
Monica  Yes! (They run over to a platform)
Director  (To Cameraman) Make sure you get this, theyre gonna want it for
the bloopers show. (To everyone) Alright cut! Listen up everyone, when we start again
its gonna be the countdown to new years, so I wanna see everybodys excitement.
Tall Guy  Hey, pal, you have about three seconds to get away from my
partner.
Director  Whats going on over here?
Joey  Uh, take a look at the guys pants! I mean, I know you told us to
show excitement, but dont you think he went a little overboard?
Director  Whats the matter with you? Get out of here!
Joey  Yeah, take a hike wetpants!
Ross  Can you believe this? Were gonna be on the platform for the
Millennium moment!
Monica  I know! Hey, you havent been practising the routine, have you?
Ross  No!
Monica  Me too!
Ross  Hey, when the music starts up again, I was thinking of maybe goind
into the robot, yknow? (He mimics a robot)
Monica  Ross, I think we should stick to the routine, we dont wanna look
stupid!
Director  Alright were back! Ten seconds left here we go! Ten! Nine!
Eight! Seven! (He continues to count as we hear Joey think)
Joeys Head  Okay, it all comes down to this. Whatever happens,
happens. Destiny.
All  Three, Two, One!
Director  Cut!
Joey  No! Year! Happy No Year!
Director  Okay, heres where we go to the live shot of Times Square, nice
work everyone thats a wrap!
[Scene  Monica and Chandlers apartment, Chandler and Rachel are there, and Phoebe
enters with the Chick and the Duck.]
Phoebe  Hey! Look who I found!
Chandler  Oh, hey guys!
Phoebe  Yknow, birds have a very good sense of direction, and I thought
maybe they could help us find where the presents are hidden.
Chandler  Yes, if the presents are hidden south for the winter.
Phoebe  Or we could just follow your clever jokes  any ideas? No!
Didnt think so! Okay, cmon guys, show us where the presents are!
Chandler  Oh, the duck seems to think that Monica got me garbage! Hmm, I wonder
what I could get Monica thats as good as garbage?
Phoebe  Hmm, how about my azzz?
Rachel  Hey, this is hollow.
Phoebe  What?
Rachel  This bench, its hollow! I cant believe I never knew that!
(She pushes all the pillows off it and opens it up) Oh, the presents!!!
Phoebe  No, dont look directly at them!
Chandler  What?
Phoebe  Alright, no, we could look at them!
Rachel  Oh, this ones for me!
Phoebe  Oh, this ones for Chandler. Here.
Chandler  Oh great!
Phoebe  And the big ones for me!
Rachel  Ooh, lets open them!
Chandler  Okay! Okay! Okay!
Phoebe  Hee hee!
Chandler  Wait, we cant do this.
Phoebe and Rachel  Why?
Chandler  I dont wanna know what Monica got me. Yknow? I mean, look,
Im sure she worked really hard at getting you a present, and wanting to surprise me,
and you guys are gonna ruin that, and I, look we have to put these back, this is not what
Christmas is about.
Rachel  Whatever Linus, Im opening mine.
Chandler  Nobody is opening anything ok? Look, I dont know about you guys,
but I wanna see the look on Monicas face when I give her my present, and Im
sure she wants to see the look on my face when I get mine. So please, please, can we just,
can we put them back?
Phoebe  Will you get us better gifts?
Chandler  Fine!
Monica  Hey guys! You found the presents? Chandler, you let them find the
presents? Great! Do you know how long it took me to find you that water purifier?
Chandler  Thats what you got me?
Phoebe  Oh yes, I see what you mean. That look is priceless.
[Scene  Joey and Janines apartment, they both enter.]
Joey  Home sweet home, huh? Nice to, uh, get back to reality. Plus we know how
the New Years gonna go off. I guess theres no reason for all that Y2K panic,
yknow? Anyway, gnight!
Janine  Joey.
Joey  Yeah?
Janine  (She takes his hands) 3, 2, 1. (She kisses him) Happy New Year.
Joey  Oh, yoii. What was that for?
Janine  Well, I dont know tonight when they yelled cut and we didnt
get to kiss, I was really, really, disappointed, and I just, really wanted to kiss you
Joey  Really? In the moment, I really wanted to kiss you too. In the moment.
Janine  In the moment, yeah.
Joey  But only in the moment. So do ya wanna kiss again?
Janine  Sure, New Years Eve is only two weeks away. Can you wait?
Joey  No.
Janine  Me neither.
Joey  3, 2,
Janine  Joey, you dont have to count down every time we kiss.
Joey  Uh, yeah, okay. Except I sorta felt like I needed a couple of seconds to
get ready.
[Scene  Monica and Chandler's apartment, everyone except Joey is there.]
Monica  We were on the platform, ready to dance the world into the new
Millennium, and the guy yelled CUT!
Rachel  Uh, wait, so you guys are telling me you actually did the routine from
eighth grade?
Monica  Yeah. But of course we had to update it a little bit. (To Ross) Hey, by
the way, great thinking about catching me!
Rachel  Cos I was gonna say theres no way you couldve done the
end the way you guys did it back then!
Monica  What? We could do it!
Ross  I dont know, I mean you were a lot bigger, I mean, stronger
back then.
Monica  I can do it, okay? Come on, lets go. (She and Ross get up)
Monica and Ross  1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 (Ross runs to be caught by
Monica, but she moves out of the way)
Monica  I cant do it! (Ross falls into Monicas room)
Chandler  Now you do that, youre on TV.

[Scene  Monica and Chandler's, everyone is there as Joey enters happily.]
Joey  Hey!
Ross  Hey!
Joey  Listen, do you guys think I have a chance with Janine?
Monica  Honey, we have been through this before!
Rachel  Yeah. Dont do this to yourself.
Phoebe  Shes made it pretty clear, it is not going to happen.
Joey  Well all right then, I guess I shouldnt get to excited about the
fact (excitedly) that I just kissed her!
Monica  You serious?!
Chandler  Thats great!
Monica  Really?!
Phoebe  Yeah well, well see.
Ross  You kissed her.
Joey  Oh we kissed it up real nice.
Chandler  So you kissed her, so what happened after that?
Joey  I came over here to tell you guys.
Chandler  So shes just waiting over there for ya?
[Scene  Central Perk, Joey and Janine are pretty much making out at one of the tables
as Monica and Rachel look on from the couch.]
Janine  I gotta go.
Joey  Okay. (They kiss.)
Janine  Im gonna be really late for dance class!
Joey  Okay. (They kiss.)
Janine  Okay, now Im really late. (Gets up.)
Joey  Okay, Im all right, okay, but hey, could you just leave your lips?
(She kisses him on the cheek and starts to leave.)
Janine  (to Monica and Rachel) Bye.
Monica  Bye. (Janine exits.)
Joey  Have you kissed her yet? Its awesome! I could do it forever!
Yknow what? She-she kisses better than my mom cooks!
Monica  I am so glad you said cooks.
Rachel  I know.
Chandler  (entering) Oh hey Rachel, sweetheart? You have got to tell the
post office that you have moved. Okay? We are still getting all your bills and stuff.
(Hands her all of her bills and stuff.)
Rachel  Oh-oh, Pottery Barn! (Grabs the aforementioned catalog and holds
the rest back out to Chandler.) You can throw the rest away.
Chandler  Im not your garbage man. Im your mailman.
Rachel  Monica look! Look-look-look! Here is that table that I ordered. (Shows
her the picture.)
Monica  You got it from Pottery Barn?!
Rachel  Yeah! Its an apothecary table. Does anyone even know what an
apothecary is?
Chandler  A pharmacist. (Rachel mocks him.)
Monica  Rach, Phoebe hates Pottery Barn.
Joey  I hate Pottery Barn too. They kicked me out of there just because I
sat on a bed!
Chandler  You took off your pants and climbed under the sheets!
Joey  (indignant) I was tired!
Rachel  Phoebe hates Pottery Barn?!
Monica  Yeah, she hates all mass produced stuff. She thinks her furniture should
have a history, a story behind it.
Rachel  Well this has story behind it! I mean they had to ship it all the way
from the White Plains store.
Monica  Its gotta be one of a kind. Yknow like umm, yknow uh,
whats that God awful ceramic fruit bowl she has on her counter?
Joey  Hey! I made that for her!
Chandler  You made pottery?
Joey  Yeah! I made it of this fruit bowl I found in the garbage.
Monica  Im tellingIf you put that in her apartment youll never
hear the end of it.
Rachel  Okay fine! Ill-Ill just tell her its an antique
apothecary table, she doesnt have to know where it came from. Oh! Look at this
little drawers! Oh look-look it says that it holds 300 CDs.
Chandler  Ahh, just like the apothecary tables of yore
[Scene  The Hallway between the apartments, Joey, Janine, Chandler, and Monica are
returning from a double date. Chandler is telling a joke.]
Chandler  so then the farmer says, "Thats not a cow and
youre not milking it." (Everyone laughs.)
Monica  I am so glad you guys got together, Chandler and I are always looking
for a couple to go out with and now we have one!
Chandler  Look at us, were a couple of couples!
Janine  I had so much fun tonight, and what a great restaurant.
Monica  Yeah.
Joey  And Chandler I cant believe I let you pay for this one. (They hug
and he whispers in his ear.) Thanks man.
Monica  So do you guys gonna come over tomorrow? Ill make that pasta thing
I was telling you about.
Janine  Oh that would be great!
Joey  Oh, but hey look, at least let us bring the wine.
Monica  Joey, you dont have too!
Joey  Nope-op! I insist! (He hugs Chandler again and whispers to him.) You get
the wine right?
Chandler  Yeah all right. (They part.) Okay, good night guys.
Joey  See ya tomorrow!
Monica  Tomorrow!
Janine  Cant wait! (They each go into their respective apartments.)
Janine  How are we gonna get out of that one?
Joey  What?
Janine  I cant handle two nights in a row with them.
Joey  What-whats wrong with Monica and Chandler?
Janine  I dont know, theyre just a little blah!
Joey  Blah?!
Janine  Well yknow, hes blah, shes justshes very
loud for such a small person.
Joey  Uh, theyre like my best friends. Are you saying we cant hang
out with them? Cause that would kinda be a problem.
Janine  No! Of course we can still hang out with them. Just yknow, not two
nights in a row. Okay?
Joey  I guess.
Janine  Thank you. (They kiss.)
Joey  If you want, Ill sell my friends and use the money to buy you
presents.
[Scene  Phoebe and Rachel's, Rachel is placing CDs into her antique apothecary table as
Phoebe returns home.]
Phoebe  Hey!
Rachel  Hey!
Phoebe  (sees the table) Ooh, what a great table! Where-where did you get it?
Rachel  Guess!
Phoebe  Umm, a flea market?
Rachel  Ha! See, I knew, I knew youd get it on the first guess. Isnt
it cool! Its an apothecary table.
Phoebe  Wow! Oh you can just imagine that this is where (Shes opening and
closing the drawers) they kept all the stuff to make their potions.
Rachel  Ohh, yes.
Phoebe  Yknow? Ooh, you can almost smell the opium.
Rachel  Almost.
Phoebe  How much was it?
Rachel  It was only 500 bucks.
Phoebe  500 bucks at a flea market?!
Rachel  Oh, okay see I thought, I thought you meant how much was it when it was
new, yknow like back then.
Phoebe  Oh no.
Rachel  Yeah no, I mean it was at a flea market, so it was yknow, it was
like a dollar.
Phoebe  A dollar?
Rachel  And fifty. So it was like one and fifty dollars.
Phoebe  Ohh, okay, they gave you the old time pricing.
Rachel  Yeah.
Phoebe  Well, what period is it from?
Rachel  Uh, its from yore. Like the days of yore. Yknow?
Phoebe  Yes, yes I do. God, oh its just perfect! Wow! I bet it has a great
story behind it too. Did they tell you anything? Like yknow where it was from
or
Rachel  Yes! That I know, this is from White Plains.
Phoebe  (gasps) White Plains. Oh, it sounds like such a magical place.
[Scene  Rosss apartment, Rachel is entering as Ross comes out of the kitchen
carrying popcorn.]
Rachel  Hey! Were here!
Ross  Hey!
Rachel  (seeing his new table) Ohh! Oh my God!
Ross  You like it?
Rachel  Oh no!
Ross  Its my new apothecary table!
Rachel  Ross! Phoebes gonna be here any second, she cannot see this!
Ross  Well why not?! Shell-shell love it! Its the real thing!
I got it at Pottery Barn.
Rachel  I know you did! I bought the same one! And if she sees your table
shes gonna know that I lied to her. I told her ours was an original.
Ross  Why did you do that?
Rachel  Because she hates Pottery Barn.
Ross  She hates Pottery Barn?!!
Rachel  I know! I know, she says its all mass-produced, nothing is
authentic, and everyone winds up having the same stuff. (Ross looks at his table.) So come
on, shes gonna be here any second! Can we please just cover this up with something?!
Please?
Ross  What? No! No! I am not gonna hide it from PhoebeOoh, although I did
get some great Pottery Barn sheets! (Gets them.)
Rachel  Ooo! Oh, I forgot they made sheets!
Ross  Uh, yeah! I still cant believe she hates Pottery Barn!
Rachel  Ross, get over it! Its not like she hates you.
Ross  Yeah but Pottery Barn! Yknow what I think? Its just
she-shes weird. Yknow its because shes a twin. Twins are weird.
Rachel  Ross, shes not weird, she just wants her stuff to be one of a
kind.
Ross  Huh. Yknow whats not one of a kind? A twin!
Phoebe  (entering) Hey!
Rachel  Hey!
Ross  Hey!
Rachel  Ooh, Phoebes here! Okay, lets turn out all the lights and
well just watch the movie!
Phoebe  Okay. HeyOoh, cool sheets! (Notices the sheet over the table.)
Ross  Oh, you like it? You wanna know where I got it?
Phoebe  Sure!
Rachel  He got it a flea market!
Phoebe  You bought your sheets at a flea market? Ross come on, you gotta loosen
the purse strings a little.
[Scene  Joey and Janines, Joey is pacing around as Chandler and Monica enter.]
Monica  Hey!
Joey  Hi!
Monica  The dinner will be ready in twenty minutes. This is so exciting.
Chandler  And here is the bottle of wine for you to bring over tonight. (Hands
it to him.) You were also going to buy Monica flowers but you couldnt afford it,
because you paid dinner last night.
Joey  Thanks. Thanks, but uh actually its just gonna be me again tonight.
Monica  What happened to Janine?
Joey  Oh, shes uh-uh really sick.
Chandler  Oh thats too bad.
Joey  Yeah, shes been in there all day (Points to her room), uh high
fever, a nose problem Phlegm! Phlegm! Phlegm-phlegm-phlegm!
Janine  (entering from her room) Monica! Chandler! Im really-really sorry
about tonight. I dont know if Joey told you; I just couldnt get out of going
to this play. Im sorry. Have a great time.
Joey  Kay!
Janine  Bye. (Exits)
Chandler  Thats funny, I saw no phlegm.
[Scene  Joey and Janines, continued from earlier.]
Joey  No-no, she really is sick!
Chandler  Then why-why is she going to a play?!
Joey  Uh, yknow, starve a fever, go to a play for a cold.
Monica  Joey! Why is Janine not coming over for dinner?!
Joey  Well uh, she didnt want to hang out with you guys two nights in a
row. Im so sorry.
Chandler  Well, why does she not want to hang out with us?!
Joey  Because she uh, she-she thinks that you are blah and that you, Monica, are
too loud.
Monica  (loudly) What?!! (Quietly) What?
Chandler  So she was just pretending to have a good time last night? She was
lying to our faces?!
Monica  Ugh, I can not believe this! I mean, who is she to judge us? We could
not have been nicer to her!
Chandler  And I am not blah, I am a hoot!
Joey  I know! I know! Come on, please-please you guys, dont-dont be
mad. Im sure she just, she just said that stuff because she was nervous and you guys
are like my best friends! Yknow? And it was our first date! Plus, shes really
sick!
Chandler  No, you shNo you said you made that up!!
Joey  I know, but dont you think the sick thing is way better than the
play thing?
Chandler  Eh, theyre both good. I generally just go with, Monicas
drunk again. (Monica glares at him.)
Joey  Come on you guys, come on please-please just give her another chance, huh?
Shell come around I promise.
Monica  Of course we will, come on we gotta make dinner.
Chandler  Okay.
Monica  (from the hallway) I do not like that woman!
Joey  (shouting) I can hear you!
Monica  I am loud!
[Scene  Ross's apartment, Ross, Rachel, and Phoebe are watching a movie.]
All  Aww! (They all laugh.)
Rachel  Thats funny. (Phoebe puts her feet up on Rosss table.)
Ross  Hey Pheebs, could you please not put your feet up on my new(On
Rachels glare)old sheet?
Phoebe  Oh sure! (She goes to take her feet off, but drags the sheet with her
which spills the wine.) Noo!
Rachel  Ohh!!
Ross  My apothecary table!!!
Phoebe  What?!
Rachel  Noooooo!! (Phoebe lifts up the sheet to discover the exact same
apothecary table they have.)
Phoebe  Ross, where did you get this?!
Ross  I got it at Pottery Barn!! Okay?!
Rachel  Oh my God, Phoebe, Pottery Barn has ripped off the design of our
antique!
Phoebe  Wow! Oh my God, well if theyve ripped off our table ours must be
much more than one and fifty dollars!
Rachel  Oh yes.
Phoebe  Well this doesnt even smell like opium.
Ross  Of course not, it smells like wine, which you spilled! And thanks for
wrecking my sheet by the way.
Phoebe  Oh Ross, calm down, Ill give you the 80 cents. (Ross glares at
Rachel)
[Scene  Monica and Chandler's, Monica and Chandler are sitting at the kitchen table.]
Chandler  Okay, one more time.
Monica  Chandler, would you like some more orange juice?
Chandler  Perfect decibel.
Monica  (loudly) I know!!!
Joey  (entering) Hey!
Chandler  Hey.
Joey  So uh, what are you guys doing?
Chandler  Oh nothing, were just talking. Yknow, blah-blah-blah.
Joey  Look, come on you guys, you said you were gonna try! All right look, I
came over here to invite you guys to a movie with me and Janine.
Monica  Well, Id like to but, (extremely quietly) Im not sure we
have time to go.
Joey  Ha-ha, very funnyLook! I dont know what to do! I really want
you guys to get along. Just please come to the movie with us. I mean you owe me!
Monica  We owe you?!
Joey  Thats right! I helped you guys out a lot in the start of your
relationship. Huh? I helped you guys sneak around for like six months, and I looked like
an idiot! And I was humiliated. And I only made 200 dollars!
Monica  We didnt give you any money! (Chandler is motioning,
"No!")
Joey  You dont think I know that!
[Scene  Phoebe and Rachel's, Rachel is showing Ross around the newly decorated living
room.]
Rachel  see I cant decide whether it would go better next to the new
wicker dining chair, the Sahara desk, or the Parker console table.
Ross  Wow! I didnt know that there was a Pottery Barn up here.
Rachel  I know, I know. I went a little crazy.
Ross  A little? Your place looks like page 72 of the catalogue. Oh look at that!
The ornamental bird cage! Large!
Phoebe  (entering) Hey!
Rachel  Hey.
Phoebe  (sees Ross) Oh Ross no. Be careful, that is very old! Okay? Early
Colonial bird merchants used to bring their birds to market in that.
Ross  (glaring at Rachel) Fascinating.
Phoebe  (gasps) Another amazing find! Wow! Oh I bet this has a great story too!
Rachel  Oh it does, it does! It is a room separating apparatus from Colonial
times.
Phoebe  Ah!
Ross  Hmm, a lot of this stuff is from Colonial times. Hey, what are some other
time periods Rachel? (She glares at him.)
Rachel  Well theres yore. And uh, yknow, yesteryear.
Phoebe  Yeah no, Im telling you Rachel has such a great eye for this
stuff. Ross, yknow if you ever decide you need to redecorateAnd I think that
you should. You should, you should ask Rachel to help.
Rachel  Oh honey he doesnt need my help.
Phoebe  Oh, come on! I think hes ready to get rid of, what did you call
it? The cheap knock-offs and dinosaur junk.
Ross  Really?! (To Rachel) Hey, yknow what? Since you have such a great
sense of what I need, uh ooh, heres-heres 60 bucks, why dont you take
Phoebe down to that Colonial flea market of yours and get me some stuff.
Rachel  (not sure of what to do) Yknow what? I dont, I dont
think Phoebe really wants to come.
Phoebe  No! I do want to!
Rachel  Oh, she does want to.
Ross  She does want to.
Phoebe  Yeah!
[Scene  The Street, Phoebe and Rachel are heading back from that Colonial flea market.]
Rachel  Pheebs, I dont know what to say. I guess the flea market was just
better last time.
Phoebe  Well at least I got these sheets for Ross.
Rachel  Yeah.
Phoebe  Uck, look at this! Pottery Barn, yuck!
Rachel  Yeah, yknow what? Dont look at it. (Realizes the display is
their living room) Seriously, dont look at it. (Tries to pull Phoebe away.)
Phoebe  No! Look-look! Theres the coffee table they stole from us!
Rachel  Ugh, those bastards! Lets go.
Phoebe  That fan kinda looks like ours. And the birdcage and thewait a
sec! This is our exact living room!
Rachel  No! No! No! No its not! No its not! Come on! Phoebe, ours is
totally different! I mean we dont have the (Looks desperately for something
different.) We dont have thethat lamp! And-and that screen is yknow, on
the other side.
Phoebe  Oh my God. This is where you got all our stuff, Pottery Barn! Oh
my God!
Rachel  Okay! Okay-okay lookno I did, I just wanted this stuff and I know
how you feel about Pottery Barn. Just Come on dont be mad.
Phoebe  No-no-no, but I am mad! I am mad! Because this stuff is everything that
is wrong with the world! And its all sitting up in my living room and all I can
think about is how I dont have that lamp!
Rachel  Well then honey, buy the lamp! Hey, we have that 60 bucks from Ross.
Phoebe  I cant! I cant! Unless Well are you saying that-that
you would move out if-if I didnt buy that lamp?
Rachel  What?! No! Im not gonna move out!
Phoebe  But are you saying that you would move out if I didnt buy that
lamp?
Rachel  (gets it) Oh. Yes! I would so move out!
Phoebe  Okay then I dont have a choice! I have to buy that lamp!
Rachel  Thats right!
Phoebe  But at least the apothecary table is real.
[Scene  The hallway, Joey, Janine, Monica, and Chandler are returning from their second
date.]
Joey  Well, this-this-this was great. Didnt everybody have a great time?
Janine  Well I did. I really did. And you guys, Ive got to say, Im
sorry if I was a little weird after the last time we went out. I guess I was just nervous
or something.
Chandler  Thats totally understandable.
Monica  Dont worry about it.
Janine  So we can go out again?
Chandler  Oh yeah!
Monica  Absolutely!
Janine  Oh good.
Joey  Oh well then, good night!
Monica  Good night! (They go into their respective apartments.)
Joey  See? Eh, wasnt that fun?
Janine  We have got to move!
Monica  (bursting in) I knew it!! Yknow, youre not so quiet
yourself, missy!
Chandler  And Im blah? Listen, the only thing more boring than watching
modern dance is having to listen to you talk about it, (Imitating her) "Oh Chandler,
I just lost myself in the moment."
Janine  Yknow, I know youre talking, but all I hear is, "Blah.
Blah. Blah-blah-blah."
Monica  (steps up and points at her) All right! You and me! Lets go! Right
now!
Joey  All right! All right! Enough! Enough! Enough!! Enough! (To Chandler and
Monica) You two go home! I-I-I gotta talk to Janine! (They start to leave.)
Chandler  (To Monica) Yknow I think you can take her.
Monica  (to Janine) Youd better hope I dont see you in the hallway!!
(They exit.)
Joey  All right, uh, weve got a little bit of a problem here. These people
are my friends; you cant treat them that way.
Janine  They said stuff to me too, yknow!
Joey  I know! I know! And Im going to talk to them about it. They mean so
much to me. They Theyre like my family. If you guys are gonna be fighting all
the time, I-I I dont think we can be together. It just, it just cant
work. It cant. (Starts to break up) Im very upset.
Janine  Okay. Okay. Would, would it help if I went over and apologized?
Joey  Yeah! Yeah! That would be very helpful! Yeah. (He opens the door for her
and she exits into the hallway.)
Monica  What did I tell you about the hall?!
Janine  I was just coming over here to apologize for my behavior! Id
really like it if we could be friends.
Monica  Well, I know that would make Joey happy, so, I would like that too.
Janine  Great.
Monica  Now come on. (They hug like men.) Well, Im glad we worked things
out.
Janine  Me too.
Monica  Okay.
Janine  Ill see you.
Monica  Bye. (Leaves to resume her garbage removal task.)
Janine  (muttering to herself) Or Ill hear you.
Monica  (hearing that) Thats it big girl! (Hits Janine in the butt with
the garbage bag) Come on!
Janine  Wait! (Janine pauses, then runs down the stairs.)
Monica  (chasing her) Youd better run!
Chandler  Did you hear that?
Joey  Yeah uh, what am I gonna do?
Chandler  Yeah, Im sorry man. (Pause) You wanna go watch?
Joey  Yeah! (They head downstairs.)
[Scene  Central Perk, Ross, Chandler, and Monica are there as Joey enters.]
Ross  Hey!
Joey  How ya doin?
Chandler  Hey so, did uh, did she move out?
Joey  Pretty much, yeah.
Monica  I cannot believe you broke up with her just like that.
Joey  Well, when its not right, you know it.
Chandler  You okay?
Joey  Yeah! Yeah. Ill be all right.
Ross  Yknow what would cheer you up?
Joey  What?
Ross  Im giving this lecture on erosion theories tomorrow night, I think
you should come.
Joey  (laughing hysterically) Youre right! That did cheer me up!

[Scene  Central Perk, Chandler, Phoebe, Rachel and Monica are there. Ross walks in with
a magazine in his hand.]
Ross  Hey, youre not going to believe this. I made up a joke and sent it
in to Playboy. They printed it!
Phoebe  I didnt know Playboy prints jokes.
Ross  Yeah, they print jokes, interviews, hard-hitting journalism. Its not
just about the pictures.
Monica  That didnt work on mom, its not going to work on us.
Ross  (showing them the page) Here, check it out. Its the first
one, too.
Chandler  That is funny. It was also funny when I made it up.
Ross  What?
Chandler  I made that joke up.
Ross  Uh, oh-oh, no you didnt. I did.
Chandler  Yes, I did. I told it to Dan at work, and he said it was the funniest
joke hed ever heard.
Ross  Hey, tell Dan, Thanks.
Ross  What?
Rachel  Im sorry, I was just reading the joke below it. Man, that one is
funny. (Ross grabs the magazine away from her.)
Chandler  Monica, you remember me telling you that joke, right?
Monica  No.
Chandler  Seriously?
Monica  Well, you tell a lot of jokes!
Ross  Look, Chandler, its my joke. But, hey, if it makes you feel any
better they dont print the name, so it doesnt really matter who gets credit,
right?
Chandler  Yeah, I guess.
Joey  (entering) Hey guys.
Chandler  (jumping up from his chair) Hey, Joey, Playboy
printed my joke.
Ross  No, its my joke, its mine. You can call them, theyll
tell you.
Chandler  Its my joke.
Ross  Its my joke.
Joey  Whoa-whoa-whoa. Jokes? You guys know they have naked chicks in there,
right?
[Scene  Joeys apartment, Joey is sitting at the counter as Chandler enters.]
Chandler  Dude, you have got to turn on Behind the Music. The band Heart
is having a really tough time, and I think they may break up.
Joey  Lets go watch it at your place.
Chandler  Nah, Monicas watching some cooking show. Come on, I dont
want to miss when they were skinny.
Joey  Chandler, Chandler, yknow what we should do? You and I should go out
and get some new sunglasses.
Chandler  What? No, I want to watch this. (He turns on the television and the
screen is completely covered in snow). Did your cable go out?
Joey  No, thats VH-1. I gotta tell you, the music these kids listen
to today . . . Its like a lotta noise to me. I dont know
Chandler  Joey, why is your cable out?
Joey  I uh, oh! Because, uh, I havent really paid the bill
Chandler  If you need money, will you please-please just let me loan you some
money?
Joey  No, Chandler. Look, forget about it, okay? Look, I know things have been a
little tight since Janine moved out. Oh, was she hot.
Chandler  Whoa ho.
Joey  I know! Yeah, but, look I can handle it. All right? Look, I can listen to
the radio, huh? And Ross gave me this great book (holds up the Playboy magazine).
Chandler  (picks up the phone) All right, you want to see if the joke stealer
will let us watch the show at his place?
Joey  Sure.
Chandler  (with phone to ear, obviously hearing no dial tone) Paid your phone
bill?
Joey  Not so much.
[Scene  Monica and Chandler's, Monica and Rachel are on the couch looking at the Playboy
magazine. When they hear someone coming, Monica goes to hide it under the sofa cushions.]
Phoebe  (entering) Hey.
Monica  (relieved) Its only you.
Phoebe  Wh-wh-what are you doing?
Rachel  We are looking at a Playboy.
Phoebe  Oh, I want to look too! (She runs over and sits down and checks out a
picture). Yikes!
Monica  So do you think that these picturesAre, are they trying to tell a
story?
Rachel  Oh, yeah, sure. I mean, like in the case of this young woman, she has
lost her clothes, so she rides naked on the horse, shes crying out, Where are
they, where are they?
Monica  Well, shes not going to find them lying in the grass like that.
Phoebe  Oh, yeah. Aw, remember the days when you used to go out to the barn,
lift up your shirt, and bend over?
Rachel and Monica 
Rachel  You see, now, I would date this girl. Shes cute, shes
outdoorsy, you know, and she knows how to build a fire. I mean, thats got to come in
handy
Monica  Okay, Ive got a question. If you had to pick one of us to date,
who would it be?
Rachel  (thinks) I dont know.
Monica  Me neither.
Phoebe  Rachel.
Monica  What?!
Phoebe  I dont know. (Pause) Me neither.
[Scene  Central Perk, Joey, Chandler, and Ross are sitting on the couch.]
Joey  You forget how many great songs Heart had.
Chandler  Yeah.
Ross  You know, Barracuda was the first song I learned to play on the keyboard.
Chandler  So, you heard it, you repeated it, so that must mean you wrote it.
Joey  Oh, you guys, with this joke. I gotta say, I know I cracked up, but
Im not even sure I got it.
Ross  What, you didnt get it? The doctor is a monkey.
Chandler  And monkeys cant write out prescriptions.
Chandler  (stops laughing, to Ross) You are not allowed to laugh at my joke.
Ross  Your joke? Well, I think the Hef would disagree, which is why
he sent me a check for one hundred ah-dollars.
Chandler  So, you stole my joke, and you stole my money.
Ross  Well, I was going to stick it in the ATM, but now I think Ill show
the sexy teller that I am a published writer.
Chandler  Well, she is going to know that you stole the joke.
Ross  Oh, what are you going to do, follow me down there?
Chandler  Yeah!
Ross  Well, Im not going to go now anyway (he goes to sit down).
Chandler  Okay (he goes to sit down).
Gunther  (handing Joey the bill) Here you go.
Joey  Ah, Gunther, I cant pay for this right now because Im not
working, so Ive had to cut down on some luxuries like uh, payin for stuff.
Gunther  Well, if you want, you can work here.
Joey  Uh, I dont know. Ya see, its just, see I was a regular on a
soap opera yknow? And to go from that to this, I just Plus, Id have to
wait on all my friends.
Gunther  Okay, but the moneys good, plus you get to stare at Rachel as
much as you want.
Joey  What?!
Gunther  Flexible hours.
Joey  Maybe I could be a waiter. Could I use the phone?
[Scene  Monica and Chandlers bedroom, they are in bed together.]
Monica  (visibly upset) She picked Rachel. I mean, she tried to back out of it,
but it was obvious. She picked Rachel.
Chandler  (visibly upset) He took my joke, he took it.
Monica  Its wrong. You know what else is wrong? Phoebe picking Rachel.
Chandler  You know who else picked Rachel? Ross, and you know what else Ross
did? He stole my joke. You know what? Im going to get a joke journal. Yknow?
And document the date and time of every single one of my jokes.
Monica  Thats a good idea.
Chandler  Yeah!
Monica  Do you know whats a bad idea?
Chandler  Picking Rachel.
Monica  Thats right. (A noise comes from the living room.) Did you hear
something?
Chandler  Maybe its the sound of Ross climbing into my brain and stealing
my thoughts.
Monica  Its coming from the living room.
Joey  (sheepishly) I finished my book. (Chandler and Monica slowly retreat back
to bed.)
Monica  (entering) Hey, you guys.
Phoebe and Rachel 
Monica  (laughing) Oh, dont you guys look cute. You guys make
such a cute couple.
Rachel  Monica, what are you doing?
Monica  (laughing harder) Nothing, Im just trying to recreate
some of the fun that we had at my place the other day. (To Phoebe) Remember, when you
picked Rachel over me? That was funny.
Phoebe  I guess it was kinda funny.
Monica  (angrily) It wasnt funny at all! Why would you do that?
Why didnt you pick me?
Phoebe  Fine. The reason that I was leaning a little bit more toward Rachel than
you is just that youre  just  kinda high maintenanceOkay
lets go to lunch!
Monica  That is completely untrue. You think Im high maintenance? Okay,
prove it. I want you to make a list and were going to go through it point by point!
Phoebe  No, okay, youre right. Youre easy-going. Youre just
not as easy-going as Rachel. Shes just more flexible and-and mellow. Thats
all.
Rachel  (To Monica) Well, people are different.
Phoebe  Ya, you know, Rachel  shell do whatever you want.
Yknow, you can just walk all over her.
Rachel  What? Wait a minute. What are you saying, that Im a pushover?
Im not a pushover.
Phoebe  Oh, okay, (laughing) youre not a pushover.
Rachel  Oh my  you think Im a pushover. Well wait, watch this, you
know what? Youre not invited to lunch. What do you think of that? I think
thats pretty strong, thats what I think. Come on, Monica, lets go to
lunch. (She leaves)
Monica  (to Phoebe) You start working on that list. (She grabs her
coat and leaves, too.)
Rachel  I cannot believe her.
Monica  I know. Where do you wanna go eat?
Rachel  Oh, oh, I love that Japanese place.
Monica  Im sick of Japanese. Were not going there.
Rachel  All right, wherever you wanna go is cool.
Monica  All right.
[Scene  Central Perk, Monica, Rachel, and Chandler are there as Ross enters and sees
Gunther.]
Ross  (showing the Playboy magazine to Gunther) Oh, hey, Gunther, check this
out.
Gunther  Yeah, that-that Chandler cracks me up.
Joey  Hey Ross, listen, you want anything to drink, cause Im heading
up there.
Ross  Uh, yeah, Ill take a coffee. Thanks, man.
Joey  Sure. (To Monica and Rachel) Coffee? Cause Im going up there.
Rachel  No.
Monica  No, thank you.
Joey  (to a table of strangers) You guys need anything, cause Im
heading up there.
Woman  Id love an ice water.
Joey  You got it.
Monica  Joey, what are you doing?
Joey  Just being friendly. (He gives Monica a whats wrong with
you? look and proceeds to walk behind the counter.)
Rachel  Joey, honey, I dont think youre supposed to go back there.
Joey  Nah, its okay. Right, Gunther? (Winks at him as if theyre in
on a secret together.)
Gunther  Dont wink at me. And put on your apron.
Joey  Okay, but I dont see you asking any other paying customers to put on
aprons.
Monica  Joey, do you work here?
Joey  No.
Customer  Hey, waiter.
Joey  Yeah?
[Scene  Central Perk, continued from earlier.]
Monica  Joey, whats going on. What didnt you tell us you work here?
Joey  Its kind of embarrassing, yknow. I mean, I was an actor and
now Im a waiter. Its supposed to go in the other direction.
Chandler  So is your apron. Youre wearing it like a cape.
Joey  I mean, the jobs easy and the moneys good, you know? I guess
Im going to be hanging out here anyway. I might as well get paid for it, right? I
just feel kind of weird serving you guys.
Rachel  Come on, Joey, I did it and it was fine.
Ross  Yeah, why would it be weird? Hey, Joey, can I get some coffee?
Joey  Okay, I guess it doesnt seem that weird.
Ross  Seriously, I-I asked you before and you still havent gotten it.
Joey  See, now its weird again.
Chandler  I think its great that you work here. Youre going to make
a lot of money, and heres your first tip Dont eat yellow snow. (He laughs,
then picks up a pen, glares at Ross, and writes in his journal). Ah ha ha, 2
Rachel  Well, you know what? This is great. Finally, I have someone I can pass
on my wisdom too. Let me tell you about a couple of things I learned while working at the
coffeehouse. First of all, the customer is always right. (Joey nods.) A smile goes a long
way. (Joey smiles) And if anyone is ever rude to you? Sneeze muffin.
Joey  Thanks, Rach. Look, you guys are just terrific. Yknow? Now, how
about clearing out of here so I can get some new customers. Its all about turnover.
Ross  Joey, seriously, can I get my coffee?
Joey  Oh, Im sorry, Ross. Ill get it for you right now. And since I
made you wait, Ill toss in a free muffin.
[Scene  Phoebe and Rachels, Phoebe is sitting on the couch as Rachel and Monica
enter.]
Rachel  Phoebe. We would like to talk to you for a second.
Phoebe  Okay.
Monica  So, maybe I am a little high maintenance. And maybe Rachel is a little
bit of a pushover. But you know what we decided you are?
Rachel  Yes, we are very sorry to tell you this, but you, Phoebe, are flaky.
Monica  Hah!
Phoebe  That true, I am flaky.
Rachel  So, what, youre just, youre just okay with being flaky?
Phoebe  Yeah, totally.
Monica  Well, then, Im okay with being high maintenance.
Rachel  Yeah, and I am okay with being a pushover.
Phoebe  Thats great. Good for you guys.
Monica  I am not high maintenance!
Rachel  I am not a pushover!
Phoebe  Who said you were?
Monica and Rachel 
Phoebe  Oh, Im flaky. Ill say anything.
[Scene  Central Perk, Joey is coming back from using the phone.]
Joey  Hey, Gunther. Can you uh, can you cover for me? I just got an audition.
Gunther  No, Im leaving to get my hair dyed.
Joey  Really?! I like your natural color. Come on man, its a great part.
Look, check it out. Im the lead guys best friend and I wait for him in this
bar and save his seat. Listen-listen. Im sorry, that seats saved.
Gunther  Thats the whole part?
Joey 
Gunther  Okay, Ill see you in an hour.
Joey  Oh, man, I could totally get that part. Im sorry, that seat is
taken.
Patron  Oh, excuse me.
Joey  No, no, I didnt mean you. But, you believed me, huh?
Patron  I believed you were saving this seat for someone.
Joey  So, youd hire me, right?
Patron  For what?
Joey  Exactly! All right, everybody, listen up. The coffeehouse is going to be
closed for about an hour.
Customers  Huh? What?
Joey  Yeah, its for the kids. To keep the kids off drugs. Its a very
important issue in this months Playboy. Im sure you all read about it.
[Scene  Monica and Chandler's, Chandler and Ross are both pouting and sitting on the
couch.]
Ross  Its my joke.
Chandler  Its my joke.
Ross and Chandler 
Ross  Yknow, I dont think were going to settle this.
Chandler  Lets have Monica decide.
Ross  Yeah!
Chandler  Yeah!
Ross  Hey Mon.
Chandler  Mon, get out here!
Ross  Monica! (She appears, not sure why she was summoned.)
Chandler  Okay, okay. You have to help us decide whose joke this is.
Monica  Why do I have to decide?
Chandler  Because youre the only one that can be fair.
Ross  Yeah.
Monica  I cant be fair. Youre my boyfriend.
Ross  Yeah, but Im your brother. Were family. Thats the most
important thing in the world.
Chandler  (to Ross) Dont try to sway her. (To Monica) (Softly) Im
your only chance to have a baby. Okay, lets go.
Ross  Well each tell you how we came up with the joke and then you decide
which one of us is telling the truthme.
Monica  Okay, Chandler, you go first.
Chandler  Okay, I thought of the joke two months ago at lunch with Steve.
Monica  Oh, wait, is he the guy I met at Christmas?
Chandler  Can I finish my story?!
Monica  Do you want me to pick you?!
Ross  See, I would never snap at you like that.
Monica  Continue.
Chandler  So Steve said he had to go to the doctor. And Steves
doctors name is Doctor Muppy. So I said, Doctor Monkey? And that is how
the whole Doctor Monkey thing came up. (He slams his feet up on the table to emphasize his
point.)
Ross  Are you kidding? Okay, look. I-I studied evolution. Remember, evolution?
Monkey into man? Plus, Im a doctor, and I had a monkey. Im Doctor Monkey!
Chandler  Im not arguing with that.
Monica  All right, Ive heard enough. Ive made my decision.
Monica  You are both idiots. The joke is not funny, and its offensive to
women, and doctors, and monkeys! You shouldnt be arguing over who gets credit, you
should be arguing over who gets blamed for inflicting this horrible joke upon the world!
Now let it go! The joke sucks!
Ross  Its your joke.
Chandler  Is not.
[Scene  Central Perk, Rachel is sitting at a table and Phoebe is on the couch. Chandler
and Monica can be seen outside, shes lecturing him, and pushes him inside. He then
nods to Rachel, and is obviously counting off the seconds in his head and then Monica
makes a grand enterance.]
Monica  Hi, Chandler. There you are.
Chandler  Hi, oh hi.
Monica  Hey, its Phoebe and Rachel. Um, why dont you tell them what
you were telling me earlier about me not being high maintenance?
Chandler  (starts to recite a rehearsed speech) Monica is a self-sufficient,
together lady. (Pause.) Being with her has been like being on a vacation. And what may be
perceived as high maintenance is merely attention to detail and(He falters and
Monica prompts him.)generosity of spirit.
Rachel  Wow, you know what? That is the best fake speech I think Ive ever
heard.
Phoebe  Really? Ive heard better.
Monica  Wait, wait, he came up with that himself. Tell them, Chandler.
Chandler  (To Chandler) Im out of words. Should I just say the whole thing
again?
Monica  Look, I am not high maintenance. I am not. Chandler!
Chandler  (pauses as he struggles with what he has to say) Youre a little
high maintenance.
Monica  Ahhh! You are on my list.
Chandler  Im sorry. Youre not easy-going, but youre
passionate, and thats good. And when you get upset about the little things, I think
that Im pretty good about making you feel better about that. And thats good
too. So, they can say that youre high maintenance, but its okay, because I
like  maintaining you.
Monica  (embarrassed) (To Phoebe and Rachel) I didnt even tell him to say
that. (They hug). All right youre off my list.
Chandler  (happily) Im off the list. (Sits on the couch.)
Monica  (sits next to him) Phoebe, its okay that you dont want me to
be your girlfriend because I have the best boyfriend.
Phoebe  (to Monica) Yknow, suddenly I find you very attractive.
Chandler  Hey, buddy boy, howd the audition go?
Joey  Not good, no. I didnt get the part, and I lost my job here, so

Phoebe  Wow! That is a bad audition.
Rachel  How-how did you lose your job here?
Joey  Well, I had the audition but Gunther said I had to stay here and be in
charge so he could go get his hair dyed. So, I went anyway, and then he fired me.
Rachel  He left work in the middle of the day to do a personal errand and left
you in charge when youve been working here two days? Thats not, thats
not right.
Joey  Yeah, what are ya gonna do?
Rachel  Joey, you cant let him get away with that. Ya know what, Im
not going to let him get away with that. Im going to say something to himNo, I
really shouldnt say anythingNo, I should say something to him. (Goes to the
counter) Gunther, I want you to give Joey his job back. That is really not fair that you
have to fire him
Gunther  Okay.
Rachel  What?
Gunther  He can have his job back.
Rachel  Thats right, he can have his job back. Im glad we got that
all straightened out. There you go, Joey, you got your job back.
Joey  Thats great. Thanks Rach.
Rachel  Yeah, pretty nice, huh? Now whos a pushover?
Phoebe  (returning from the bathroom) Rach, youre in my seat.
Rachel  Oh, Im sorry. (Gets up and moves.)
[Scene  Monica and Chandler's, Monica, Phoebe, and Rachel are sitting at the kitchen
table, talking.]
Phoebe  Hey, I never got to hear who you guys would pick to be your girlfriend.
Monica  I pick you, Phoebe.
Rachel  Oh, yeah. Definitely you, Pheebs.
Phoebe  Yeah, well, I kinda thought.
Chandler  Hey.
Rachel  Hey. Oh, I have a question. If-if-if one of you had to pick one of the
other two guys to go out with, who would you pick?
Ross  No way.
Joey  Im not answering that.
Chandler  Joey! (Pause as they all stare at him.) No way. Im not answering
that.

[Scene  Central Perk, Joey is giving Rachel, Chandler, Phoebe, and Ross their bills.]
Joey  Okay Rach, that muffin and espresso, $4.50. Ross, double latte, $2.75.
Chandler, coffee and a scone, $4.25. And Pheebs, herbal tea, $1.25. So, all together
thats (pauses to figure the total) $12.75.
Chandler  This coming from the man who couldnt split our 80 dollar phone
bill in half.
Woman  Hi!
Joey  Hi!
Woman  How much do I owe you for the muffin and the latte?
Joey  Oh thats on the house courtesy of Joey Tribbiani.
Woman  Oh great! Well, tell him thanks. And since uh, Joey seems like such a
nice guy, maybe we could go on a date sometime?
Joey  Well, hes not used to women being so forward with him; but uh, I
good check with himHe says its okay. (She hands him her card.) Great! Thanks!
Bye-bye!
Ross  Hey Joey, how come our stuff isnt free?
Joey  It will be when you look like that in a tight skirt! This is great!
Im getting more dates than ever!
Rachel  Wait a minute, youre only giving free stuff away to the pretty
girls?
Phoebe  Yeah Joey that is so gross!
Joey  How about a scone on the house baby?
Phoebe  (giggles) Im pretty.
[Scene  Monica and Chandler's, everyone but Monica is there playing Monopoly.]
Ross  Hey does anyone have any gum?
Phoebe  Oh I do! (She grabs her huge purse and starts rummaging through it and
taking out various items in a futile search for the gum.) Oh, yknow what? No.
(Pause) Wait a second. (She removes a bag filled with water that has a goldfish swimming
in it.) I know its in here somewhere.
Ross  Yknow what? Im good! Im good!
Monica  (entering) Hey!
Ross  Hey!
Chandler  Hey, what are you doing here? Shouldnt you be at work?
Monica  (congested) Ugh, they sent me home. They said I cant work if
Im sick.
All  Ohh!
Chandler  Im so sorry youre sick.
Monica  Im not sick!! I dont get sick! Getting sick is for weaklings
and for pansies!
Rachel  Honey, no one thinks youre a pansy, but we do think you need a
tissue. (She notices something hanging from Monicas nose, as does Joey.)
Monica  (wiping her nose) I have not been sick in over three years! (Sneezes.)
Chandler  Im gonna grab you some tissue.
Monica  I dont need a tissue! Im fine-d!
Ross  When you put a D at the end of Fine youre
not fine.
Monica  Im fine-d. Im fine-d! Yknow, its a really hard
word to say.
Chandler  Yes?
Woman  Hi, is Rachel here? Im her sister.
Rachel  Oh my God, Jill!
Jill  Oh my God, Rachel!
Chandler  Oh my God, introduce us!
Rachel  This is Chandler. (Points at him.)
Jill  Hi!
Rachel  And you know Monica and Ross!
Ross  Hi Jill.
Rachel  And thats Phoebe (points), and thats Joey.
Joey  Hey, (in the Joey voice) how you doin?
Rachel  Dont!! (Joey backs away frightened.) (To Jill) Honey, what are you
doing here?!
Phoebe  (To Ross) Which-which sister is this? Is this the spoiled one or
thats bitter?
Jill  (To Rachel) Daddy cut me off.
Phoebe  Never mind, I got it.
Jill  And yknow what I said to him? "Im gonna hire a lawyer and
Im gonna sue you and take all your money. Then Im gonna cut you off!"
Rachel  Wow! What did he say?
Jill  That he wouldnt pay for my lawyer! Then he told me to come here and
learn about the value of money from the one daughter hes actually proud off.
Rachel  Oh! Did you hear that?! My dads proud of me! My dads proud
of me.
Monica  Rach? (Points to Jill.)
Rachel  Oh yeah, sorry. Wait honey, so what did you do that made dad cut you
off?
Jill  Okay, I bought a boat.
Monica  You bought a boat?
Jill  Yeah but it wasnt for me, it was for a friend.
Chandler  Boy did we make friends with the wrong sister! (Rachel glares
at him.)
Rachel  Jill, honey, I think this is the best thing that couldve ever
happened to you. I mean you needed to get out on your own anyway! And you know when I did
it, I-I-I at first I was scared, and look at me now! Im the only daughter dad is
proud of! Okay, well this is, this is what youre gonna do. Youre gonna get a
job, youre gonna get an apartment, and then Ill help you and you can stay with
us. Right Pheebs, she can stay with us?
Phoebe  Of course, yeah!
Jill  Oh, thats so great! Okay, Im really gonna do this! I
dont know how to thank you guys.
Phoebe  Ooh, I like cards.
[Scene  Central Perk, Joey is working as Phoebe and Ross are sitting on the couch.]
Joey  (to a customer) Are you all finished here?
Customer  Yes.
Joey  Great! (Joey takes his cookie and finishes it.)
Gunther  Okay, here are the tips for this morning. Jen gets 50, 50 for me, and
Joey owes eight dollars.
Joey  What?!
Gunther  For all the free food you gave away.
Joey  Well if its free food, how come youre charging me for it?
Gunther  We dont give anything away unless its someones
birthday.
Joey  Well, what if they came in third in a modeling contest?
Gunther  No!
Joey  (to a woman who came in third in a modeling contest) Sorry! (He grabs her
muffin away and returns it to the serving tray.)
Jill  (entering, carrying a bunch of shopping bags) I just had the hardest day.
Those bags are so heavy. (Sets them down.)
Ross  Jill, how did you pay for all this? I thought your dad took away your
credit card.
Jill  Oh please, I memorized those numbers when I was 15. But look at all the
cool make-it-on-my-own stuff I got! (Holds up a red sweater) This is my "Please, hire
me" sweater. (Holds up a pair of black pants) And these are my, "Dont you
want to rent me this apartment?" pants.
Ross  I dont think charging new clothes too your dad qualifies as making
it on your own.
Jill  Oh, Mr. Scientist has to get all technical!
Phoebe  Seriously, I dont Rachels gonna think its a good idea.
Jill  So who made her queen of the world?
Phoebe  I would love that job!
Rachel  (entering) Hey! Whats goin on?
Jill  Hey!
Rachel  (notices Jills bags) Jill! Did you shop?!
Jill  No! They did! (Points to Phoebe and Ross)
Phoebe and Ross 
Rachel  You went shopping?! What, and then you just came in here and paraded it
right under Jills nose when you know shes trying to quit. Wow, you guys are
terrible!
Phoebe  Sorry Jill.
Ross  Sorry-sorry Jill.
Rachel  Whatd you get?
Phoebe  Oh well, all right, I got (Ross hands her a bag) (To Ross) thank you, I
got uh, this yknow "I want a job sweater." (Holds up the same sweater.)
Rachel  Oh.
Phoebe  And, and then I got uh, these are apartment pants.
Rachel  Apartment pants?
Phoebe  Yeah, you never heard of them?
Rachel  No, of course, of course Ive heard of them! Ross, what did you
get?
Ross  Huh? Oh, I got this(Holds up this pink frilly thing)this!
Rachel  A pajmena?
Ross  Yeah! Oh, I-I love this babies!
Rachel  Really?
Ross  Ross, wants a pajmena?
Ross  Its a rug. (Jill winces.)
Rachel  Jill?
Jill  (covers her eyes and starts crying) Im sorry Rachel, Im
sorry
Rachel  Oh, come on! You think thats gonna work on me?! I invented that!
Jill  Right! But, I am sorry.
Rachel  All right, its okay. One little setback is okay, just dont
let it happen again, all right? Now since daddy paid for all this stuff, I should
take it all away. But Im just gonna take the-the pajmena. (Ross hands it to her.)
And the uh, and the uh pants. Yknow what, Im just gonna take it all away,
cause that way youll just really learn the lesson. Okay? All righty, Im
gonna run a couple of errands and I will see you at dinner. (Leaves with all of
Jills stuff.)
Jill  She took all my stuff.
Ross  Yeah. Everything but, the little blue one. (Holds it up for her.)
Jill  (gasps) Thats the best one! Oh my God, (hugs him) thank you so much!
Ross  Well. Hey
Jill  Oh my gosh, that was so lame. Like a pajmena could be a rug!
Ross  Oh yeah, how about you and the, (mimics her fake cry) "Im
sorry!"
Jill  (hits him) Shut up! I did not sound like that at all!
Phoebe  What about, what about when I said yknow about the apartment
pants, how dumb was I?
Jill  Were you this cute in high school?
Ross  Oh stop.
Jill  No you stop!
Ross  No, you stop!
Jill  You stop!
Phoebe  (gets up and sits between them) Okay-okay, why dont I sit here and
youll both stop it!
[Scene  Monica and Chandler's, Monica is still very sick and is entering the living
room from the bathroom wearing a robe. Chandler is reading a magazine.]
Monica  Okay, so what do you, what do you want to do? Lets do something
crazy!
Chandler  I know, lets rest and drink lots of fluids. (Holds up a glass of
orange juice.)
Monica  Okay, Ill rest. But yknow if Im going to bed, then
youre coming with me.
Chandler  That would be impossible to resist if you werent all drippy
here. (Points to his nose.)
Monica  (wiping her nose) Are you saying that you dont wanna get with
this? (Tries to do a little sexy body rub, but it doesnt work all that well with the
big robe.)
Chandler  Yeah, I dont you should say that even when youre healthy.
Monica  (in a sexy voice) Come on. (Coughs loudly.)
Chandler  Dont take this personally okay? Its just that I just
cant have sex with a sick person.
Monica  Im with you Chandler! I mean I cant have sex with a sick
person either, thats disgusting! But Im not sick! Let me prove it to you. We
are two healthy people in the pribe of libe.
Chandler  Thats the thing, see I would like to stay in the pribe of
mwha-ah-libe.
[Scene  Phoebe and Rachel's, Rachel is putting away her new clothes as Phoebe enters.]
Rachel  Hey!
Phoebe  Hey.
Rachel  Whats up?!
Phoebe  Umm, I think theres something you should maybe know.
Rachel  Well, itd better not be about the apartment pants, because I just
pitched the idea to my boss at Ralph Lauren and she loved it.
Phoebe  No. No. Its just I was umm, I was with Ross and Jill after you
left and umm, Im pretty sure I saw a little spark between them.
Rachel  What?!
Phoebe  Yeah I mean its probably nothing, but I just wanted to warn you
that there might be something there.
Rachel  With Ross and Jill?
Phoebe  Yeah!
Rachel  With Ross and my sister?
Phoebe  Yeah.
Rachel  With my sister Jill and my ex-boyfriend Ross?
Phoebe  Yeah.
Rachel  Oh there is no way.
Phoebe  Okay then.
Rachel  Oh my God! I can not believe that! I mean I dont really like it
when Ross goes out with anyone, but my sister isnt that like incest or something?!
Oh my God, and theyre gonna have sex! Oh! Oh no what if he marries her too?! Oh this
is just terrible, this is just terrible. And I cant stop it! I cantI
dont own Ross! Yknow? And Jill, she should be able to do whatever it is that
she wants to do! And oh my God, I cant believe Ross is marrying my little sister,
this terrible. Oh my God, this is just the worst thing that could have ever happened to
me.
Phoebe  But great news about the apartment pants, huh?
[Scene  Central Perk, Joey is giving the bill to the same beautiful woman from before.]
Joey  Thatll be $3.85.
Woman  What do you mean? Yesterday you said I was too pretty to pay for stuff!
Joey  Its just I cant because my manager said I (Gets an idea)
(Starts singing) "Happy birthday to you, happy birthday to you. Happy birthday dear
Annie
Woman  Amy!
Joey  (still singing) "Amy! Happy birthday to you!"
A Male Customer 
Joey  Yeah, not it here it isnt.
Jill  (entering) Sorry Im late, whats up?
Rachel  (on the couch) Oh hi! Yknow, I just wanted to see if there were
any leads on the old job front.
Jill  Oh no! But I just walked past three sales and I didnt go in. How
strong am I?
Rachel  That is great. Hey, yknow who doesnt have to job hunt? Ross.
He works at the university.
Jill  Yeah.
Rachel  Oh so you know that, you guys talked about that, so you get along, so
you think youre gonna go out?
Jill  Me go out with Ross?! No! God no! What would make you think that?
Rachel  I just, Phoebe, said yknow thought she saw something between you
guys.
Jill  No! I mean hes nice.
Rachel  Yeah.
Jill  Hes the kind of guy youre friends with, yknow? But
hes not the kind of guy you date. Hes the kind of guy youd date
because you did. Me, not so much.
Rachel  Oh not-not so much. Umm, what-what do you, what do you mean is there
something wrong with Ross?
Jill  Oh no-no-no, hes just I dont know, hes just a little
bookish.
Rachel  Are-are you saying hes a geek?
Jill  You think so too?
Rachel  No! No I, no Ross is not a geek!
Jill  Fine, then lets just say hes not my type.
Rachel  What handsome is not your type? Smart? Kind? Good kisser? What those
things arent on your list? Ross is a great guy! You would be lucky to be with him!
Jill  Well okay, if it means that much to you, then Ill ask him out.
Rachel  Oh no-no-no, no-no-no, thats not what I meant.
Jill  No! Yknow what Rachel? Youre right, yknow he has been
really nice to me.
Rachel  Yeah but, hes not your type.
Jill  Yeah but maybe thats a good thing. Yknow Im doing all
these different sorts of things, and maybe I should try dating a geek too!
Rachel  Yeah but, you dont, you dont, you dont want to try to
much too fast. Yknow? I mean, you do remember what happened to the little girl that
tried to much too fast dont you?
Jill  What?
Rachel  She-she died Jill.
[Scene  Monica and Chandler's, Chandler has fallen asleep reading a book. Monica calls
from the bedroom and wakes him up.]
Monica  (still sick) Chandler!
Chandler  Oh what is it honey, you need some tea? Some soup? (He gets up from
the couch and goes into the bedroom to find Monica, still in the robe, lying seductively
on the bed. Or at least shes trying too and as he enters the room, she takes the
robe off on of her legs.) Oh-ohhhh!
Monica  (trying to be seductive) Calling Dr. Big, Dr. Big to the bed.
Chandler  Oh Jeez honey, I thought, I thought you were asleep.
Monica  How could I be asleep knowing that you were in the next room.
Chandler  I was asleep. (She takes off her robe and starts to shiver) Oh no!
No-no honey! Yknow whats sexy? Layers. Layers are sexy. And blankets are sexy.
And oh! Hot water bottles are sexy.
Monica  Come on, get into bed! I want to prove to you that Im not sick! I
wanna make you feel, as good as I feel. (Sneezes.)
Chandler  Would you please get some rest!
Monica  Im fine. (She goes into one of those half sneezing, half-coughing
fits that you get with a bad cold or flu.)
[Scene  Central Perk, Joey is singing Happy Birthday to yet another good-looking woman.
Gunther is watching and is not very happy.]
Joey  (singing) "Happy birthday to you!"
Gunther  Youre paying for that.
Joey  What? No-no its her birthday!
Gunther  Youve sung Happy Birthday to 20 different women today!
Joey  But it really
Gunther  You are no longer authorized to distribute birthday muffins.
Joey  Damnit! (Storms off.)
Ross  (entering) Rach? Hi!
Rachel  Hi!
Ross  Did you tell your sister to ask me out?
Rachel  Well yeah
Ross  Oh wow! I mean, wow! I mean, I-I-I think shes cute but I-I would
never have thought of going out with her, never!
Rachel  Really?!
Ross  Yeah but after you said it was okay, I figured, "Why not?!"
Rachel  Oh so-so not really never.
Ross  I have to say you are a much bigger person than I am. I mean after all
weve been through, I justyknow I wish I had a brother to reciprocate.
Hey, if you ever want to go out with Monica, you have my blessing.
Joey  (overhearing them) Oh-ho, and mine!
[Scene  Monica and Chandler's, Monica is still sick and is hobbling out into the living
room for some help from Chandler whos on the couch reading.]
Monica  (entering) Chandler, I think Im sick.
Chandler  Really? Struck down in the pribe of libe!
Monica  Okay, fine I admit it! I feel terrible! Would you please rub this on my
chest? (She hands him some of that Vicks Vap-O-Rub to put on.)
Chandler  No-no-no-no-no-no-no, you are not getting me this way.
Monica  Come on! I really need your help!
Chandler  No-no-no-no-no!
Monica  Fine, Ill rub it on myself.
Chandler  Okay.
Chandler  So youre just, kinda rubbing it on yourself?
Monica  Yeah?
Chandler  Its nice.
Monica  Are you kidding me?! Is this; is this turning you on?
Chandler  Yes! (Hangs his head in shame.)
Monica  I cant believe it! What is it? Is it the rubbing or the smell?
Chandler  Its all very, very good. (She covers up and sits down.) So you
wanna go uh, mix it up?
Monica  Not now, Im sick!
Chandler  Oh come on you big faker!
Monica  What happened to your rule about never sleeping with sick people?
Chandler  Well that was before all the vaporizing action.
Monica  Okay, if you really wanna have sex
Chandler  Okay! (Runs into the bedroom.)
Monica  Worked like a charm.
[Scene  Central Perk, Rachel is there as Jill enters to start her date with Ross.]
Jill  (entering) Hi!
Rachel  Hi! Wh-what are you doing here?
Jill  This is where Ross and I are meeting for our date. So, what do you think?
(She spins to show Rachel the outfit shes wearing.)
Rachel  Well, I-I dont like it.
Jill  Really?!
Rachel  Its kinda slutty.
Jill  Its yours!
Rachel  Yeah well, Im-Im a slut.
Jill  (laughs) Me too.
Ross  (entering) Hi Jill!
Jill  Hey!
Ross  Hi (sees Rachel and forgets her name for a moment).
Rachel  Rachel.
Ross  Rachel! Well, you-youre not at home,
youre-youre-youre right here.
Rachel  Yeah I know, and I bet you thought it would be weird. But its not!
Ross  Okay. So well Ill umm, (To Rachel) Ill have her home by
midnight.
[Scene  Monica and Chandler's, Rachel enters and walks quickly over to the window to
watch Rosss apartment. We see that Rosss apartment is empty.]
Rachel  Why arent you home yet?!
Monica  (calling from the bathroom) Is someone there?
Rachel  Oh yes, its me! Sorry!
Chandler  (calling from the bathroom) What are you doing here?
Rachel  Uh, Im just, Im just looking out your window. At-at the
view. What are you guys doing?
Chandler  We got some Vap-O-Rub in some places.
Rachel  (gasps) Oh, he brought her back to his apartment.
Monica  (entering with Chandler) Who? (She looks out the window at Rosss
apartment) Is that your sister?
Rachel  Ugh, she is a slut!
Monica  God, Ross is on a date with your sister! How weird is that?!
Rachel  Oh my God, look-look hes taking off her clothes!
Chandler  Hes taking off her coat!
Rachel  Oh, this is just terrible.
Monica  Oh no its not, no its not. Its a first date. Im sure
that nothing is gonna(as she is talking we see Ross close his drapes.)
Rachel  Oh. (Squeaks again.)
Chandler  Ho-oh, hes gonna get some! (Rachel looks at him.) Of the glare
from the streetlight out of his apartment. Yknow so umm, hes closed the drapes
there so he can have a nice, pleasant conversation with your little sister. (Pause) Well,
Im off to bed! (Goes to bed.)
[Scene  Monica and Chandler's, Rachel is still looking out the window as Joey enters.]
Joey  (sees Rachel) Oh, uh, hey Rach. I uh, I was just coming over here to
uh Oh wait, I dont have to lie to you, you dont live here anymore. Uh,
Im eating their food. What are you doing?
Rachel  Ross is on a date with my sister and they shut the drapes two and
a-half-hours ago.
Joey  Whoa, I didnt know we could date your sister!
Monica  Joey we know you steal our food.
Chandler  Im good.
Monica  (To Rachel) Oh, are the drapes still closed hon?
Rachel  Yeah. And yknow who shouldve shut their drapes? Is that
perverted old couple two doors over.
Chandler  (looking) Is that a swing?
Rachel  Oh dont even ask!
Chandler  Yuck!
Joey  I cant believe Ross went out with Rachels sister! When
Chandler made out with my sister I was mad at him for 10 years.
Chandler  That was like 5 years ago.
Joey  Yeah you got 5 years left!
Chandler  Joey
Joey  You wanna make it 6?!
[Scene  Central Perk, Ross is on the couch reading as Rachel enters. Its the next
day.]
Rachel  Oh Ross, hi! Hey, how are ya? There you are!
Ross  Hey!
Rachel  (to Gunther) Ill take a coffee. (To Ross) So how was your big date
last night?
Ross  Uhh, it was okay. Yeah, it was fun.
Rachel  Yeah fun? Great! So uh, so did you guys hit it off?
Ross  I guess so.
Rachel  So uh, so did anything happen? Because rumor has it you guys shut
the drapes!
Ross  No. No. Nothing happened. I shut the drapes to uh, show her slides of my
favorite fossils.
Rachel  Oh, slides. (Laughs.) So really nothing happened.
Ross  Something couldve happened. All right? She-she really dug my slides.
And-and she was definitely giving me the vibe.
Rachel  Right. Was it the, "Please dont show me another picture of a
trilobite vibe?"
Ross  Anyway, if she, if she wasnt in to me, why-why would she ask me out
again?
Rachel  She asked-asked you out again?
Ross  Yeah-uh-huh. Tomorrow night, Valentines Day, the most romantic day
of the year. Who knows what could happen? I might not be shutting my drapes to show her my
slides, if you know what I mean.
Rachel  Okay-okay-okay-okay-okay-okay-okay! I got it! I got it! I got it! I
cant! I cant! I cant! I cannot go with you and my sister thing. Okay? I
just cant. Its just too weird, all right? I imagine the two of you together
and I freak out. It freaks me out. I cant do it! I cant do it.
Ross  (while Rachel is finishing her rant) Okay! Okay! Okay! Its okay.
(Rachel stops.) Its okay. Hey, its too weird for you, I wont see her
again.
Rachel  Thank you. Iyeah.
Ross  I mean after tomorrow night.
Rachel  No-no-no! No-no-no! Please Ross, I cant! I cant do it!
(Starts to freak out.) Its just gonna freak me out!!!
Ross  Okay! Okay! Ooh-hey-hey-hey! Okay! Okay! Okay! Ill-Ill tell
her tonight I cant see her anymore.
Rachel  Ross thanks.
Ross  You want me to call her right now?
Rachel  Oh no! No! No-no-no-no! No, I mean come on thats-thats
crazyI mean thats crazy. So whats-whats going on with you? What is
going on with you?
Ross  Well umm, oh! I might be teaching another class this semester!
Rachel  Yeah do it now, call right now.
[Scene  Monica and Chandler's, Chandler, Monica, Phoebe, and Joey are watching ET.]
Monica  (crying) This is my favorite part.
Phoebe  (crying) Yeah me too.
Phoebe  Oh yknow whats sadder than this? Bambi. I cried for
three days with that movie. No wait two! Because on the third day my mother killed herself
so I was partly crying for that.
Chandler  (totally not crying) Well see now that I can see crying over, but Bambi
is a cartoon!
Joey  (crying) You didnt cry when Bambis mother died?
Chandler  Yes it was very sad when the guy stopped drawing the deer!
Monica  Chandler theres nothing wrong with crying! I mean you dont
have to be so macho all the time.
Chandler  Im not macho.
Monica  Yeah youre right. I dont know what I was thinking.
Chandler  No, I guess I just never really cried. Yknow? Im not a
crying kind of guy.
Joey  Come on man theres gotta be something that gets you choked up! Like
uh, uh oh, what if you saw a three-legged puppy?
Chandler  Id be sad sure, but I wouldnt cry.
Joey  Okay, what if the puppy said, "Help me Chandler. All the other
puppies pick on me."
Chandler  Cry?! I just found a talking puppy, Im rich!
Monica  Oh, Ive got it! I have got it! (Gets up and gets something from
the dresser underneath the TV.) Pictures from your childhood. This will get you going
good!
Phoebe  All right, whats going on there? (Points to a picture.)
Chandler  Oh, thats Parents Day, first grade. Thats me with
the janitor Martin.
Monica  Where were your parents?
Chandler  Oh they didnt want to come!
Phoebe  Oh Chandler!
Monica  Poor thing!
Phoebe  So that story doesnt make you cry?
Chandler  No! Look, I dont cry! Its not a big deal! Okay?!
Joey  No! Its not okay! Its not okay at all!! Youre dead
inside!!
[Scene  Central Perk, Phoebe is putting away her guitar as a man approaches.]
The Fan  Excuse me.
Phoebe  Yeah?
The Fan  Are you Phoebe Buffay?
Phoebe  Yeah.
The Fan  Can-can I get your autograph, Im your biggest fan. (Holds out a
napkin and a pen.)
Phoebe  Oh youre my biggest fan? Ive always wanted to meet you! Hi!
(Shakes his hand.) Sure! Yeah! (Signs the autograph)
The Fan  Wow! Wow, thanks a lot! I just wanna say, I think youre really
talented.
Phoebe  Youre just saying that because youre my biggest fan. (The
fan leaves and Joey approaches.) (To Joey) Joey listen, take good care of that guy, okay?
(Points) Hes a fan. (To the fan as shes leaving) Bye! (Exits)
Joey  (to the fan) So, you saw me on Days Of Our Lives huh? Want me to,
want me to do a little Dr. Drake Remoray for ya?
The Fan  I have no idea what youre talking about. But I, but I just got
Phoebe Buffays autograph!
Joey  Oh, youre Phoebes fan!
The Fan  Oh yeah! Ive seen all her movies.
Joey  Movies?
The Fan  That was Phoebe Buffay, the porn star.
Joey  (laughs) I dont think so.
The Fan  No-no, it was! She was in Sex Toy Story 2, Lawrence of Alabia, and I
got her autograph! The guys at the comic book store arent gonna believe this!
(Exits.)
Joey  Hey Gunther, dont let that guy in here anymore! He just said
Phoebes a porn star!
Gunther  Well, I wouldnt call her a star, but shes really good. You
should check out Inspecther Gadget.
[Scene  Central Perk, time lapse, Rachel is at the counter as Jill enters.]
Jill  Hey!
Rachel  Hey!
Jill  Youll never believe what just happened, Ross just totally blew me
off and he didnt even tell me why!
Rachel  Ohhh well. Yknow what honey? The best thing to do to get over a
guy is to start dating someone else. Oh! There is this great guy you will love at work
named Bob! Hes a real up-and-comer in Human Resources.
Jill  Yknow, thanks for trying to cheer me up, but Im not gonna date
some random guy from your work.
Rachel  Its not random, its Bob.
Jill  Its probably because not mature enough. Or smart enough. Maybe he
doesnt like the way I dressNo that cant be it. Its really gotta be
the smart thing. Oh Im so stupid! Im just like this incredibly pretty
stupid girl!
Rachel  No honey, okay, okay, you wanna know why Ross canceled the date? Because
I asked him to.
Jill  You asked him too?!
Rachel  Hm-mmm.
Jill  Why?!
Rachel  Because you are my sister and Ross and I have this huge history
Jill  I dont understand, do you want to go out with Ross?
Rachel  No.
Jill  You dont want him, but you dont want me to have him?
Rachel  (changing the subject) Yknow Bob in Human Resources
Jill  Ugh! I cannot believe you did this too me! You had me doubting how smart I
was! (Gasps) You had me doubting my fashion sense!
Rachel  Look, this is not that big of a deal! You just dont date Ross!
Theres a million other guys out there, you just
Jill  Hey! You have no right to tell me what to do.
Rachel  Im not telling you what to do! I am telling you what not to
do!
Jill  Why are you so jealous of me?
Rachel  Jill this is not about me being jealous of you! This is about you being
a brat! Wanting what you cant have!
Jill  Cant have?! Excuse me, the only thing I cant have is dairy!
(Starts to storm out.)
Rachel  All right, all right, well you just blew your chances at dating Bob!
Jill  Who?!
Rachel  In Human Resources!!!!!!
[Scene  Monica and Chandler's, Rachel is ranting about Jill to Chandler and Monica.]
Rachel  I am jealous of her?! I mean who does she think she is?! Princess
Caroline?!
Monica  Youre jealous of Princess Caroline?
Rachel  Do I have my own castle?
Ross  Hey! Uh, Phoebes not here is she?
Rachel  No.
Monica  (noticing the bag Joeys carrying) Oh great! Did you get a movie?
Joey  Uhhh, yeah. Yeah. But uh, I dont think its the kind
youre gonna like.
Chandler  You didnt get more movies that are gonna have us reaching for
the tissues all night did you?
Joey  Sort of
Monica  Guys, whats going on?
Joey  (holds up the movie) Phoebes a porn star!
All  What?!!
Rachel  Oh my God!
Monica  Thats Phoebe! Where did you get that?
Joey  Well down at the adult video place down on Bleaker.
Ross  And-and I, and I saw that Joey was about to go in, so I ran in ahead of
him to-to surprise him and, and then I pretended I didnt know he was in there. (They
all kinda look at him.)
Rachel  Wow! I mean, I justI cant, I cant believe this.
Yknow, I mean you think you know someone even, even Phoebe whos always been
somewhat of a question mark.
Monica  This is so bizarre. I guess it kinda makes sense though, yknow she
had such a terrible childhood.
Chandler  Hey, I had a terrible childhood and I dont do porn.
Monica  Yes, but you are dead inside.
Joey  All right well, Id better take that back.
Monica  Wh-what, why?
Joey  We cant watch that! I mean thats Phoebe!
Monica  Yeah youre right, we cantwe shouldnt watch this.
Rachel  Absolutely not.
Monica  (hands the tape back to Joey, but doesnt let him grab it)
Yknow maybe a little bit!
Rachel  Probably just the first half.
Joey  No! Hey no! This is wrong you guys! Phoebes our friend! Well,
Im not gonna watch it!
Ross  Yeah! Good for you Joe!
Joey  Yeah.
Buffay, the Vampire Layer  Ah, I thought Id find you here, Nasforatool.
The Vampire  Buffay, are you going to plunge your stake into my dark places?
Buffay, the Vampire Layer  Actually, I was kinda hoping it would be the other
way around.
Monica  Hold on a second! What is that on her ankle?
Chandler  Her ankle is what youre watching?
Rachel  Well its hard to tell (Rachel gets up to get a closer look,
only shes having some trouble.) Oh God, if she would just stop moving.
Chandler  Shes just doing her job!
Joey  (sitting at the kitchen table with his back to the TV) You sick bastards!
Rachel  Oh, its a tattoo! Thats weird, Phoebe doesnt
Wait thats Ursula! Thats not Phoebe that is Ursula!
Joey  Re! Re! Then I can watch that! Rewind it! Rewind it!
Phoebe  (entering) Hey! Whats up? (Sees the TV) Oh my God! What am I
doing?!!
[Scene  Monica and Chandler's, Chandler is reading Chicken Soup for the Soul as
Monica enters.]
Monica  Hey sweetie!
Chandler  Hey! (He quickly tries to hide the book by throwing it under the
couch, only the couch has no back and it slides into the kitchen.)
Monica  (picking up the book) Chicken Soup for the Soul?
Chandler  Theres no back to this couch!
Monica  Why are you reading this? You hate this kind of stuff.
Chandler  Yeah I know, but I figured a shot yknow? Maybe one of those
stories would make me cry and then you wouldnt think I was yknow, all dead
inside.
Monica  Oh thats so sweet! Look Chandler I dont care if you
cant cry, I love you.
Chandler  Oh that makes me feel so warm in my hollow tin chest.
Monica  Stop it!
Chandler  No, I mean, come on, seriously think about it, we get married,
were up at the altar and Im like this. (Makes a bored face.)
Monica  I wont care, because I know you will be feeling it all in here.
(Points to her heart.)
Chandler  Yeah?
Monica  Yeah! And if, and if we have a baby one-day, and the doctor hands it to
you in the delivery room and you dont cry, so what! And-and-and, and if we take him
to college and come home and see his empty room for the first time, and you got nothing,
it wont matter to me.
Chandler  Okay, well I wont uh, worry about this anymore then.
Monica  And-and-and if I die, from a long illness. And youre writing out
my eulogy and you open a desk drawer and you find a note from me that says, "I will
always be with you," and you still cant shed one tiny tear, I know youll
be crying a river inside.
Chandler  Aww, I love you so
Monica  What is wrong with you?!!!
Chandler  What?!
Monica  What?! You cant shed a tear for your dead wife!! Now, I left you a
note from the beyond!
Chandler  So you didnt mean any of that?!
Monica  No you robot!!
[Scene  Ross's apartment, his doorbell is ringing and hes running to answer it
while doing up his pants.]
Ross  You damn kids! You ring my bell one more time, I swear to (Opens the
door to find Jill standing there.) Ohh, uh Jill. Umm, that-thats just a little game
I play with the kids down the hall. Umm, theyve really taken a liking to me.
(Quickly looks out to see if theyre watching.) Uhh
whats-whats-whats the matter?
Jill  Rachel and I had a really big fight, can I come in? I-I mean I know
were not supposed to see each other anymore and Im okay with that, its
just that I dont know anybody in the city and I really need somebody to talk to
about it.
Ross  Of course, what happened? (Lets her in.)
Jill  (entering) I dont want to talk about it.
Ross  Okay, umm
Jill  But you know what might really cheer me up?
Ross  What?
Jill  Seeing some more of your super-cool slides.
Ross  Wow! Really?!
Jill  Totally, I love them! And, maybe you could finish telling me about all the
different kinds of sand.
Ross  Well, Id love to! Here, you wait right here and Ill go get the
projector and my notes!
Jill  Oh great! Thanks Ross, youre such a good friend!
Ross  Ohh!
Rachel  Hey! Have you guys seen Jill? I cant find her anywhere.
Monica  No, I havent.
Rachel  Well, is Ross home? Maybe Ill just call him to see if hes
actually seen her.
[Scene  Ursulas apartment, Phoebe is going to confront her twin about her new
porn career.]
Ursula  Who is it?
Phoebe  Its Phoebe! Phoebe!
Ursula  Hey!
Phoebe  (seeing her dress) Oh God. So-so youre making porn movies.
Ursula  No Im not.
Mans Voice  Were still rolling!
Phoebe  Youre making one right now!
Another Mans Voice  Lets go Phoebe!
Phoebe  And-and youre using my name!
Ursula  Yeah, can I help you with something?
Same Mans Voice  Phoebe, come on!
Phoebe  Look, Im talking right now! Youreyou mean her.
Ursula  Yknow, twin stuff is always a real big seller.
Phoebe  What?!
Ursula  Yeah, I can talk them into giving you like, 30 dollars.
Phoebe  No!! No way! No! And stop using my name! And shame on you! (Yells into
the apartment) And shame on all of you! Youre disgusting! Especially you (points to
someone) with that! (Storms away.)
[Scene  Ross's apartment, Ross is setting up for the slide show.]
Ross  Slides are almost ready.
Jill  Yeah. Ooh, I know what this is missing! Alcohol!
Ross  Uh okay, well theres-theres wine in the kitchen.
Jill  Oh great! (Goes to get it as the phone rings.)
Ross  (answering it) Hello?
Rachel  (on phone) What is my sister doing there?! And why are the
drapes shut?!
Ross  O-okay, Rach calm-calm down, okay? She-shes really upset were
just talking.
Rachel  Ross! I think she is trying to make something happen with you to get
back at me!
Ross  So thats the only reason she could be here huh? It couldnt
have anything to do with the fact that-that maybe Im a good listener and I uh I put
on a great slide show!
Rachel  Ross, I am telling you that she is using you to get back at me!
Ross  Yknow what? I think I can take care of myself, Ill talk to you
later. Good-bye. (Hangs up the phone and turns to find Jill sitting really close to him.)
Whoa! Uh, that was your sister actually. She-she thinks that youre just using me.
Jill  So? (Kisses him passionately.)
[Scene  Central Perk, Joey is reading a paper as Phoebe enters.]
Phoebe  Hey!
Joey  Hey!
Phoebe  So, I just came from the company Ursula works for.
Joey  Oh no, not you too!
Phoebe  No! No! I just went to pick up Phoebe Buffays checks; there were a
lot of them.
Joey  Nice!
Phoebe  Um-mmm, and I wont have to go there anymore because I gave
them my correct address.
Joey  Thats great, but isnt it gonna bother that people still think
youre a porn star?
Phoebe  Oh no! No! I know how to handle it.
Joey  You do?
Phoebe  Yeah. (She notices some guy putting a coat on his girlfriend is trying
to remember where hes seen her before.) (To him) Youre trying to figure out
where you know me from? All right, Ill give you a hint. From porn! Okay? (He tries
to rush his girlfriend out.) Yeah your pervert boyfriend watched me in a porno movie! (To
Joey) See?
Joey  Yeah.
[Scene  Monica and Chandler's, time lapse, Ross is entering. Chandler and Monica are at
the kitchen table. Rachel is on the couch reading.]
Chandler  Hey.
Ross  (To Rachel) You uh, you may have been right about Jill.
Rachel  Oh! I knew it! What happened?
Ross  Umm, she kissed me.
Rachel  What?! You kissed!
Chandler  (To Monica) Maybe we should give them some privacy.
Monica  (To Chandler) Shhhh!!!
Ross  Look, I uh, I tried not to kiss her, okay?
Rachel  Well, it doesnt sound like it! I mean, its pretty easy not
to kiss someone, you just dont kiss them! See look at us, right now, not kissing!
Ross  Let me finish, okay? She started kissing me and-and I didnt stop it.
I guess I-I just wasnt thinking
Rachel  Yeah thats right you werent thinking! Yknow what? Let
me give you something to think about! (She pulls up her sleeves and steps towards him.)
Ross  Oh waithold it! But then I started thinking and I stopped the
kissing.
Rachel  Oh, well thank you for taking your tongue out of my sisters mouth
long enough to tell me that.
Ross  Look I-I realize if anything were to happen with me and Jill then nothing
could ever happen with us!
Rachel  What?!
Ross  No, I mean, look I dont know if anything is going to happen with us,
again. Ever. But I dont want to know that it-it never could. So I stopped it and she
got mad and broke my projector.
Rachel  Wow. I, I dont even know what to say. Thank you. (Gently kicks
him.)
Ross  Youre welcome. (Gently kicks her back.)
Monica  Oh my God! Are-are you crying?
Chandler  (crying hysterically) I just dont see why those two cant
work things out!
[Scene  Central Perk, everyone is there as Jill enters.]
Jill  All right, Im leaving! Because Im not going to spend one more
day with someone whose out to sabotage my every move. Thats you Rachel!
Rachel  Yeah, I got that.
Jill  (To Ross) And you! I throw myself at you and you say no, how gay are you?
Ross  You take care Jill.
Jill  (happily) Okay, see ya! (Exits.)
Rachel  Bye-bye-e!
Monica  Bye.
Chandler  (starts crying) I-I cant believe Jills gone. (They all
look at him.) I cant help it, I opened a gate.

[Scene  Central Perk, everyone is there as Rachel enters.]
Rachel  Hey, you guys! Guess what? Barry and Mindy are getting a divorce!
Monica  Oh my God!
Phoebe  Wow!
Joey  (To Ross) What is the matter with you?!
Phoebe  No! Barry and Mindy.
Joey  Oh sorry, I hear divorce I immediately go to Ross. (To Rachel)
Who-whos Barry and Mindy?
Rachel  Barry was the guy that I was almost married and Mindy was my best
friend.
Joey  Ohh-oh, wasnt he cheating on you with her?
Rachel  Yeah, but that just means that he was falling asleep on top of her
instead of me.
Monica  Why did they get divorced?
Rachel  Well, apparently she caught him cheating on her with someone else.
Isnt that sad? (Giggles.) God, could you imagine if I actually married him?! I mean
how different would my life be?
Ross  I know what you mean, Ive always wondered how different my life
would be if-if Id never gotten divorced.
Phoebe  Which time?
Ross  The first time! No seriously, imagine if Carol hadnt realized she
was a lesbian.
Joey  (starts to imagine it) I cant. I keep seeing it the good way.
Ross  Id bet Id still be doing my kara-tay. (Thats karate,
hes just saying it that way.) Towards the end of our marriage I was doing a lot of
kara-tay as a way of releasing the tension from yknow, not doing anything else
physical.
Chandler  Maybe the problem was you were pronouncing it kara-tay.
Monica  And what if I was still fat? (To Chandler) Well, you wouldnt be
dating me, thats for sure.
Chandler  Sure I would!
All  (simultaneously) Oh yeah! Come on! Yeah right!
Chandler  What, you guys really think that Im that shallow?
Ross  No, I just think Monica was that fat.
Joey  Hey, imagine if I never got fired off Days Of Our Lives! (Closes
his eyes to do so.) Oh-hey, theres Carol again!
Chandler  What if I had had the guts to quit my job? Id probably be
writing for the New Yorker, getting paid to be funny. But my jobs fun too! I
mean tomorrow, I-I dont have to wear a tie.
Phoebe  What if I had taken that job at Merrill Lynch?
Ross  What?!
Rachel  Merrill Lynch?
Phoebe  Yeah, I had a massage client who worked there and-and he said I had a
knack for stocks.
Rachel  Well why didnt you take the job?
Phoebe  Because at that time you see, I thought everything that rhymed was true.
So I thought yknow that if Id work with stocks, Id have to live in a
box, and only eat lox, and have a pet fox.
Ross  Hey, do you guys think that if all those things happened, wed still
hang out?
{Transcribers note  This is where the opening credits are, but theyre not
the usual opening credits. Oh no! These credits are based on the world that would
have been created had all of the above actually happened. It starts out with all of them
at the fountain sitting on the couch as Fat Monica runs up and sits on the arm of the
couch, tilting the whole thing towards her. It then goes on to show Rachels still a
shop-aholic and with Barry. Fat Monica is sweating while cooking and dancing while eating
a donut. Phoebe as the Wall Street shark smoking while on two cell phones. Then
theyre dancing in the fountain. Joey entering as Dr. Drake Remoray and meeting a
groupie. Chandler trying to write as a bird does its business on his shoulder and falling
asleep while typing. Ross doing some kara-tay and trying to get Carol into bed. And
finally, some more dancing in the fountain, them all flexing, and the turning out the lamp
and shutting off all the lights bit from the first season. Just remember one thing, this
is an alternate universe. Everything from every other episode doesnt apply, for
instance, Ross and Rachel have no history. And in fact have not seen each other in years
in this world.}
[Scene  A newsstand, Ross is buying a magazine and gets in line behind a woman.]
Ross  (recognizing her) Oh my God! Rachel Green?
Rachel  (gasps) Rob Tillman!
Ross  No-no. Its-its me, Ross!
Rachel  Oh, Im sorry. Ross Tillman.
Ross  No, no-no, Ross Geller.
Rachel  Ohh, of course Monicas brother!
Ross  Yeah. Right.
Rachel  Wow! How are you?!
Ross  Good-good, Im-Im married. (Shows her his ring.)
Rachel  Ohh! Me too!
Ross  Is-isnt it the best?
Rachel  Oh, its the best! (They both exhale contemplating the joys of
marriage.) So, umm hows Monica?
Ross  Oh really, really great! Yeah! A-actually shes right down the
street, umm, do-do you know what? You should stop bye and say hi.
Rachel  Ohh, I would love too.
Ross  Yeah? Oh-oh, shed be so excited!
Rachel  Ohh! Okay!
Ross  Come on! (They start to leave.)
Rachel  Oh wait, dont you have to pay for your, (looks at his magazine)
Busty Ladies?
Ross  No, its okay. Some-some kid asked me to pick it up for him, but I
dont
Rachel  (laughs) Oh yeah? Okay.
Ross  (putting the magazine back and holding the money for it) Okay.
Rachel  But! Dont you have to give him his money back?
Ross  Uh-huh. (Steps to a random kid nearby and hands him his money.) Hey, here
you go buddy. Sorry, no porn for you. (To Rachel) Okay, lets go see Monica!
[Scene  Central Perk, Joey, Fat Monica, and her boyfriend are sitting on the couch.
Monicas boyfriend is getting up to get something. For future reference, for the rest
of this episode Monicas fat, I wont be calling her Fat Monica throughout.]
Joey  So Monica, still going out with Dr. Boring huh?
Monica  Hes not boring! Hes just-hes just low key.
Monica's Boyfriend  (returning) Here we go, one Hazelnut Latte. (Hands it to
Monica and sits down.)
Monica  Thanks.
Monica's Boyfriend  Yeah. Yknow, the hazelnut actually not a nut,
its a seed.
Joey  (not impressed) Wow!!
Monica's Boyfriend  Can anyone else name a well known seed thats been
masquerading as a nut?
Joey  Oh dear God, let me think. (Starts to sarcastically think about it.)
Chandler  (entering, depressed) Hey.
Joey  Hey.
Monica  Oh no! Whats the matter?
Chandler  Oh I just got another rejection letter. They said my writing was
funny, just not "Archie Comic funny."
Monica's Boyfriend  Yknow what honey? I got to get back to the hospital.
Monica  Okay.
Monica's Boyfriend  (kisses her) Okay.
Monica  Bye.
Monica's Boyfriend  Bye-bye. (Gets up to leave.) Oh uh, by the way, the answer
is, the Brazil nut. (Exits.)
Chandler  Was his question whats more boring than him?
Joey  Hey man, look sorry about that Archie thing. Do uh, do you need me
to give you some money?
Chandler  Hey, I may have no money, but I still have my pride.
Joey  Really?
Chandler  Ehh.
Monica  Maybe Joey doesnt have to give you the money, TV stars have
assistants right?
Joey  Thats an idea! (To Chandler) Hey, if I hired an assistant,
would-would you take money from her?
Monica  No Joey! Chandler could be your assistant! See, he could answer all of
your fan mail and stuff!
Joey  Thats great! That would be great! Lets do that!
Chandler  I could use the money; it could give me time to write.
Joey  Oh right great! Welcome aboard!
Chandler  Okay!
Joey  All right! Now hey, I need to use the bathroom. Since I dont need
any assistance in there, take a break!
Chandler  All right!
Phoebe  (entering) Hey!
Monica  Hey Phoebe! Guess what?
Phoebe  What?
Monica  Joey just hired Chandler to be his assistant!
Phoebe  Ohh thats so sweet! (Her cell phone rings.) Oh! Hang on! (Quickly
grabs a cigarette and starts to light it as her phone rings.) Hang onnnnnn!!! (Gets the
cigarette lighted and answers the phone.) (On phone.) Go!! No! No-no! I said sell when it
hits 50! 5-0, its a number! It comes after 4-9!! No, its okay. Its okay,
youre allowed one mistake. Just kidding, you are of course fired.
Ross  Hey Mon!
Monica  Hey!
Ross  Mon, look who I ran into! (Gestures towards Rachel.)
Monica  (gets up and gasps) Oh my God! Rachel!! (Rachel is stunned to see that
her long lost friend is still fat.) (Monica goes over and gives Rachel a big bear hug,
which is quite easy for her.) You look terrific!
Rachel  Ohh, so do you! Did you lose weight? (Shes not quite sure of that
one.)
Monica  You are so sweet to notice! Yes, I lost three and a half pounds!
Ross  And, and uh, you-you remember my friend Chandler. (Points to him.)
Chandler  Hey.
Rachel  Oh yeah.
Ross  And thats Phoebe over there! (Points to her.)
Phoebe  Hi!
Monica  Oh my God, sit down! Sit down! How long as it been since weve seen
each other?
Ross  (answering it) 1987, the day after Christmas, at Sean McMahons
party. I played you one of my songs, yknow Interplanetary Courtship Ritual.
Rachel  Oh yeah. Right. So now, aredo you, do you still do music?
Ross  Sometimes, you should come over (Joey returns from the bathroom) sometime!
Ill play you one of my other
Rachel  (interrupting him and seeing Joey) Oh my God! Joey Tribbiani from Days
of Our Lives, just walked in here!
Monica  Rach, hes a friend of ours.
Rachel  (stunned) You are friends with Dr. Drake Remoray?
Chandler  Well its kinda hard to be friends with Drake because of his busy
schedule and the fact that hes not real.
Ross  (To Rachel) Hey-hey, or I could bring my keyboard over here
sometime!
Rachel  Hes coming over! Hes coming over!
Monica  (getting up) Joey!
Joey  (holding a plate of what looks like Rice Crispies Treats) I know,
here-here!! (Hands her the plate.)
Monica  Ohhh! (Takes the plate.) No! This is my friend Rachel, we went to High
School together.
Rachel  (giggles and cant look at him) Hi!
Joey  (shaking Rachels hand) Hi!
Rachel  (still not quite able to look at him) Hi! I love you on that show! I
watch you everyday! I mean, when you took out your own kidney to save your ex-wife even
though she tired to kill you
Joey  Well, its always nice to meet the fans.
Rachel  Ah!
Joey  (turning and whispering to Monica) Shes not crazy is she?
Monica  No.
Joey  (To Rachel) So uh, how you doin?
[Scene  Monica and Phoebe's, Monica, Chandler, and Phoebe are there. Phoebes cell
phone rings and she goes through her little routine of lighting a cigarette before
answering the phone.]
Phoebe  Hang on! Hang on! Hang on! (Answering the phone.) Go!! Whos this?
(Listens) Oh okay, youre gonna like working for me. Whats your name? (Listens)
What kind of name is Brendy? I Whatever Stop talking! All right, from now on
your name is Joan. You can pick your own last name.
Joey  (entering) Hey there you are!
Chandler  Uh-oh, its my boss!
Joey  All right, heres a list of things for you to do today. Man, this
going to be so great! Thank you so much! All right, I got to go to work Im
delivering twins today, but only one of them is mine! (Exits.)
Chandler  (reading the list) Drop off my dry cleaning. Pick up my vitamins.
Teach me how to spell vitamins. Wear in my new jeans.
Monica  (laughs) You realize what you are dont you?
Chandler  What?
Monica  Youre his bitch.
Phoebe  (yelling from Monicas room) No-no!! No!!
Monica  (panicked) Oh wait! You didnt just sit on my Kit-Kats did
you?!!
Phoebe  No! There-there was a little, a little diff in the market and I lost 13
million dollars.
Chandler  But the Kit-Kats are all right?!
Phoebe  What am I gonna do?! What am I gonna do?! I cant call my office
theyll kill me! I cant call my clients theyll kill themselves! Great,
now my chest hearts.
Monica  What?!
Phoebe  (louder) My chest hurts! Oh, and now I-I cant breathe.
Chandler  Phoebe, are you having a heart attack?!
Phoebe  Oh, if I were, would-would I have shooting pains up and down my left
arm?
Monica  Yes!!
Phoebe  Then yes that is what Im having. (Takes another puff of the
cigarette.)
Monica  Oh my God!
[Scene  A hospital, Phoebe is recovering from her heart attack as Ross, Monica, and
Chandler are there to comfort and support her.]
Ross  Come on Pheebs, its not that bad! Yknow most people would be
excited if they didnt have to work for a couple of weeks.
Phoebe  Most people dont like their jobs, I love my job! I have not
been working for three hours and Im already going crazy. I miss Joan.
Monica  Honey, having a heart attack is natures way of telling you to slow
it down.
Chandler  I always thought having a heart attack was natures way of
telling you to die! (Phoebe glares at him.) But youre not gonna die. I mean, you are
going to die, but youre not gonna die today. I wish I was dead.
Monica  Lets take a walk. (They start to leave.) Yknow maybe you
should consider writing for Talking Out of Your Ass magazine! (They exit.)
Phoebe  (To Ross) So whats going on with you?
Ross  Well umm, Ive been doing a lot more of my kara-tay.
Phoebe  Still going through that dry spell with Carol?
Ross  Yeah.
Phoebe  How long has it been since you had sex?
Ross  Well, last weekend
Phoebe  Oh thats not so bad.
Ross  will be two months
Phoebe  That is.
Ross  since I stopped trying.
Phoebe  Maybe you need to spice things up a little.
Ross  What-what do you mean?
Phoebe  I dont know. You could tie her up, she could tie you up; you could
eat stuff off each other
Ross  Oh.
Phoebe  Yknow, dirty talk, ménage à trois, toys
Ross  Wow!
Phoebe  Roll playing You could be the warden; she could be the prisoner.
You could be the pirate; she could be the wench!
Ross  Okay, I think I got it.
Phoebe  Yeah! Or too, you could be two stockbrokers and
youre-youre-youre rolling around naked on the trading floor and
everybodys watching! (Ross looks at her.) It never happened.
[Scene  A hospital hallway, Chandler is sitting on a gurney with his hands spread out
behind his back. Then Monica comes and plops down on the gurney and one of his hands.
Chandler immediately recoils in extreme pain.]
Monica  Sorry. So hows it going with Joey?
Chandler  Oh just great. He beeps me now with codes. One is, "Bring me
food." Two is, "Im with a girl, bring us food." Three is,
"Im lost and I cant find food."
Joey  (entering) Hey! Is uh, is she gonna be all right?
Monica  Yeah! Shes right in there! (Points to Phoebes room.)
Joey  Oh great. (Starts to go in.) (To Chandler) Hey! Go take off those pants,
they look ready!
[Scene  Silvercup Studios, Joey is showing Rachel around the set.]
Joey  All right, and over there is Bradys Pub where I like to unwind after
a long day of surgeoning.
Rachel  Wow! This is so amazing! What else? What else?
Joey  Well, that is a large piece of television equipment. (Points at a
large piece of television equipment as an old man walks by.) And uh that is an old
man! Hey old man!
Rachel  Hey!
Joey  All righty, what do you say we head back to my place?
Rachel  (laughs) Wow! Umm, yknow, I-I would really love to, but I-I
shouldnt.
Joey  Why? (In Drakes voice.) Why cant the world stop turning, just
for a moment? Just for us?
Rachel  (awestruck, then not) Isnt that a line from the show?!
Joey  Uh, yeah but uh, (In Drakes voice) I may have said those things
before but, I never truly meant them. Until now.
Rachel  Thats a line from the show too!
Joey  Okay, you watch too much TV.
Chandler  (approaching) Here you go Joe, heres the freshly squeezed orange
juice you asked for. (Hands it to him.)
Joey  Thanks! (Looks at it.) Yeah, theres pulp in that. (Hands it back.)
Chandler  Yeah?
Joey  I thought we talked about this. I dont like pulp. No pulp. Pulp
isnt juice. All juice, okay?
Chandler  Im sorry, I guess I just like the pulp.
Joey  Oh my God, Im sorry, Im being so rude. (Turns to Rachel.)
Rachel, would like a soda or something? Because Chandler would run right out and get it.
Rachel  Yeah sure, iced tea would be great.
Joey  (To Chandler) Iced tea.
Chandler  Okay, anything for you sir?
Joey  (To Rachel) Did I not just tell him?
Rachel  (mouthing it to him) Yes, you did.
Joey  (To Chandler) Okay look, Chandler, if this (Motions back and forth
indicating the arrangement.) you have got to listen! (Tugs on his ear.) (Chandler glares
at him.) Youre gonna throw that juice at me, arent ya?
Chandler  Its not all juice! (Rachel quickly gets out of the way.)
[Scene  Ross and Carol's, Ross is trying to talk to Carol about what Phoebe told him.]
Ross  So honey, this morning was fun, huh? Me hopping in on you in the shower
there.
Carol  Yeah! And maybe someday we could get a place with two bathrooms.
Ross  Look Carol umm, I was, I was thinking maybe uh, maybe we can spice things
up a little.
Carol  What do you mean?
Ross  Carol our sex life isits just not working
Ben  (entering) Dad!! (Runs and hugs him.)
Ross  Hey there little fella! Hey, uh-hey, why dont we get some shoes on
ya, huh? Hey, why dont you show dad how you can put your shoes on, in your room!
Yay!!
Ben  Yay! (Runs off.)
Ross  Yay! (To Carol) Seriously, our sex life I was thinking, maybe I
dont know, we could try some-some new things. Yknow? For fun?
Carol  Like what?
Ross  Well I dont know umm, (Pause) what if we were too tie each other up?
(Carols shocked and obviously doesnt like that idea.) Umm, some people eat
stuff off one another. (Carol doesnt like that idea either.) Nah! Umm, yknow
we-we could try dirty talk? (Carol still says no.) Umm, we could, we could have a
threesome.
Carol  (quickly) I love that idea!
[Scene  Monica and Phoebe's, Monica is eating breakfast as Chandler enters.]
Chandler  Who sold a story to Archie Comics?!
Monica  Oh my God! Thats great! Oh wow! (Hugs him.) Youre a
published writer! I wish I had a present for you!
Chandler  Aww.
Monica  Wait a minute! (Quickly checks her pockets and pulls out) My last Kit-Kat
bar!
Chandler  You wanna share it?
Monica  Okay!!
Joey  (entering) Hey! Hey Chandler look, I know youre mad, but I just want
to say Im sorry. I-I was a total jerk. Completely o-over the line. Uh, I just I hate
pulp! Yknow? I mean, yknow how Monica feels about low fat mayonnaise?
Monica  Its not mayonnaise!!
Joey  Yeah, o-o-o-o-okay anyway, I just wanted to say Im sorry. Here.
(Hands him a cup.)
Chandler  Whats this?
Joey  Fresh squeezed orange juice, with pulp! Just the way you like it.
Chandler  Aww, thanks man. (They hug.)
Monica  Hey Joey, Chandler sold a story to Archie Comics!
Joey  Oh my God! Thats great! Congratulations! Whats the story?!
Chandler  Oh you wouldnt uh, care. Its just a stupid comic book
story.
Joey  Are you kidding me?! I love Archie! And the whole gang!
Chandler  Well uh, Archie needs money to fix his jalopy (Joey laughs), uh but he
doesnt want Reggie to just give him the money. So Reggie hires him as his
assistas his butler. And then makes him do all these crazy things like bring him
milkshakes that cant have lumps in them.
Joey  Wait a minute. That sounds a little familiar! Did they already do that
one? Cause I think I read it!
[Scene  Central Perk, Monica is there as Rachel enters.]
Rachel  Oh Mon, listen I have to ask! Okay, Joey Tribbiani invited me back to
his apartment, now does he do this with a lot of girls?
Monica  Yeah, a lot. A lot, a lot!
Rachel  Ohh! And Im one of them!! Wow! Oh, I just cannot believe this! I
mean, Joey Tribbiani!
Monica  Well, yknow its none of my business, but arent you
married?
Rachel  Yeah. Oh I just wish we could not be married for a little bit!
Yknow I just wish we could be like on a break!
Monica  Well, youre not.
Rachel  Oh, its so easy for you I mean, youre not married, you get
to have sex with who ever you want!
Monica  Yeah I can! (Laughs) And dont think I dont, because I do! I
mean all the time, you betcha! (Laughs.)
Rachel  Monica. Youve, youve done it right?
Monica  (giggles) Of course I have! What do you think, Im some 30 year old
virgin?
Rachel  Oh my God! Youre a 30 year old virgin!
Monica  Say it louder, I dont think the guy all the way in the back heard
you!
Guy All the Way in the Back 
Monica  Its not like, I havent any opportunities. I mean,
yknow, Im just waiting for the perfect guy. Im seeing this guy Roger,
all right? Hes not perfect, but umm, I think maybe I should just get it over with.
Yknow, give him my flower.
Rachel  Oh my God!! Do it!! Honey, youve waited long enough!!
Monica  Yknow what? You are right?!
Rachel  Yes!! I mean sex does not have to be a big deal! There shouldnt be
all this rules and restrictions! Yknow, people should be able to sleep with who ever
they want, whenever
Monica  Rachel! Im never gonna think its okay for you to cheat on
your husband!
Rachel  Oh what do you know? Virgin!
[Scene  The hospital, Ross and Monica are in Phoebes room. Phoebe is in the
bathroom and Monica notices smoke coming out from underneath the door.]
Monica  Phoebe, why is smoke coming out of the bathroom?!
Phoebe  Oh yeah, the doctor said that could be one of the side effects.
Monica  Phoebe! Put that cigarette out!
Phoebe  No! Its not a cigarette! The smoke is coming out of me!
Monica  Put it out!!
Phoebe  Okay! Okay! (Puts it out and comes out of the bathroom.) Im so
glad youre here.
Ross  Come on. (Helps her into bed as her phone rings.) I got it.
Phoebe  Oh, give it to me.
Ross  I got it!
Phoebe  Give it!
Ross  (on the phone) Hello? (Listens.) No she cant come to the phone right
now. (Listens.) Oh, right no problem. Okay, bye-bye. (Hangs up.)
Phoebe  Was it my work? Were they mad? Was it Jack? Did he yell?!
Ross  J-j-just relax, nobody yelled. Jack just was calling to make sure that you
were getting better.
Phoebe  Thank God.
Ross  (To Monica) Yeah, shes fired.
[Scene  Rachel and Barrys bedroom, Rachel is watching Days of Our Lives.
Of course its a Dr. Drake Remoray scene. Its set in a hospital room, and Dr.
Wesley and a nurse are talking about a female patient with a bandage around her head.]
Nurse  Youve done all you can Dr. Wesley. You have got to let
her go.
Dr. Wesley  Good-bye and God speed, Hope Brady.
Dr. Drake Remoray  Not so fast Wesley! (Rachel does a silent clap.)
Dr. Wesley  (with evil dripping off his tongue) Remoray!
Dr. Drake Remoray  Thats right Wesley! I just stopped by to say that,
youre not a real doctor! And that womans brain, is fine!
Rachel  (very relived) Oh! Thank God!
Dr. Drake Remoray  Hope! Hope!
Hope  (sleepily) Drake!
Dr. Drake Remoray  Youre not dying Hope, youre gonna live a long,
healthy life. With me.
Hope  Oh Drake.
Rachel  Okay! (She picks up the phone, Joeys phone number, and starts to
dial.) Here we go! Okay! (On phone.) Hi, Joey! Its Rachel! Umm, I am free tomorrow
night. Yeah, sure, sure I can bring some sandwiches.
{Transcribers Note  This is where Part II begins, which means this is now episode
616.}
[Scene  Ross and Carol's, Carol is working on something at the table and Ross is
reading a newspaper on the couch.]
Ross  So honey this uh, this threesome thing umm, I mean how-how are you gonna
start to find
Carol  Ooh, actually Ive been making a list of all the women I know who
might be into doing this!
Ross  Oh. (He takes the notepad she was using and looks at it.) Wow! (Flips to
another page.) Huh. (Flips another page.) Boy! (Flips another page.) Well, someones
been doing their homework. (Flips two more pages.)
Carol  Yeah. Ooh, and I know Gail Rosten is in there twice, but she is so
Ross  Oh, I know. (Laughs) Yknow, just-just talking about it is getting me
kinda
Carol  Oh, me too.
Ross  Yeah? Well, I-I think Bens asleep.
Carol  Oh umm, yknow I think it would be better if we just save it.
Ross  Yeah. Right. Save it. I can do that. (Gets up and does a little kara-tay.)
[Scene  The hospital, Chandler and Monica are there with Phoebe as Ross enters.]
Ross  Hey, Pheebs!
Phoebe  Hey.
Ross  Hey, hows it going?
Phoebe  Well, Ive got to get out of this bed, Im going crazy here.
Crazy!
Monica  (handing her a cup) Here you go sweetie.
Phoebe  What the hell is this, herbal tea? I hate herbal tea!
Monica  But, I put some honey in it.
Ross  She doesnt know she was fired yet, does she?
Chandler  No, the doctors say it may kill her.
Phoebe  What are you two girls whispering about over there?!
Chandler  (To Ross) But I think we should tell her.
Ross  Hey Pheebs, maybe this whole heart attack thing is a sign, that-that you
should start think about getting a different job.
Phoebe  Okay, what is this? A stupid contest? Because we got a winner here!
(Points at Ross.)
Chandler  Listen Phoebe, hes right. People are not supposed to have heart
attacks at 31.
Phoebe  I know! But if I didnt work there, what else would I do?
Monica  Well, you used to like playing the guitar.
Phoebe  Yeah that was lucrative! Smart like your brother!
Chandler  Uh, what about yknow the massage thing? That never gave you a
heart attack.
Phoebe  Hmm, pulling in a salary in the high six figures or rubbing gross naked
people for chump changeooh, what do I do?! What will I do?!
[Scene  Joey's apartment, (The one he had when he was Dr. Drake Remoray, because he
still is.) Rachel is there and admiring the big ceramic fake dog.]
Rachel  Ohh, I mean its just so realistic!
Joey  I know. (Joey is sitting in this tall chair that is made up of balls on
polls. Youll have to see it to know what I mean.) Yeah, his name is Pat.
Rachel  Pat the dog. Oh! Oh! I get it!! (Laughs and finishes her drink.)
Joey  (climbing down from his chair) Do you uh, do youready for a refill?
Rachel  Oh, I probably shouldntso I will! (Joey starts making her
refill and Rachel notices that rain thing Joey has.) Oh! Wow! Its like its
raining!
Joey  Pretty cool, huh? But if youre thinking you can put a fish in there
and it wouldnt get sucked up into the mechanism, well youd be wrong.
Rachel  Umm, can I use your bathroom?
Joey  Its uh, right through there. (Points.)
Rachel  Okay. (Starts to go.) God yknow, if someone told me a week ago
that I would be peeing in Joey Tribbianis apartment
Joey  Yeah, lifes pretty great isnt it?
Rachel  Yeah, it sure is!
[Scene  Monica and Phoebe's, Monica is pouring wine for her boyfriend, Dr. Roger.]
Monica  I hope youre hungry, were starting with oysters. And
yknow what they say about oysters, dont you?
Dr. Roger  They have parasites?
Monica  No! Umm well, some people say that Oysters are an aphrodisiac.
Dr. Roger  What people?
Monica  People! People say it! Come here! (She grabs him and kisses him.)
Dr. Roger  So oysters, huh?
Monica  And then were gonna have a little Middle Eastern cous-cous.
Something we can eat, with our hands.
Dr. Roger  Yknow, its funny, but when we were studying communicable
diseases
Monica  No-no-no, no! Its sensual!
Dr. Roger  Ohh! Didnt know! Okay!
Monica  Okay! (They kiss again and his beeper goes off.) Ohhh no!
Dr. Roger  Im sorry sweetie, its the hospital. The food looks great,
maybe save me some?
Monica  I cant promise anything. (She starts to dig in.)
[Scene  Ross and Carol's, Ross and Carol are waiting anxiously for their new partner to
arrive.]
Ross  Were really gonna do this, huh?
Carol  Looks like it.
Ross  Yknow, if, if this is too weird for you, we can still back out
at (A knock on the door interrupts him.)
Carol  (jumping up to get it) I got it!
Ross  Okay.
Carol  (opening the door) Susan! Hi! (Whod you think it was gonna be?)
Susan  Hey! (They hug.)
Carol  Thank you so much for coming.
Susan  Oh, I wouldnt miss it for the world.
Ross  Im-Im Ross by the way.
Susan  (not taking her eyes off Carol) Hello Ross. (Takes off her coat and hands
it to him.) I love what youve done with this space.
Carol  Thank you so much.
Ross  How hot is this?!
[Scene  Monica and Phoebe's, Chandler and Monica are eating Monicas dinner.]
Chandler  Im sorry youre here with me instead of Roger.
Monica  Yeah, me too.
Chandler  Well, I could make it seem like hes here. (Imitates him.)
"Heres some little known facts about cous-cous. They didnt add the second
cous until 1979." (Mumbles something further.)
Monica  Stop it!! Thats not funny!!
Chandler  Okay.
Monica  Im sorry, okay? It justtonight was supposed to be
yknow, it was supposed to be a big deal.
Chandler  What was tonight?
Monica  You dont want to know what tonight was.
Chandler  Okay. (Pause.) What was tonight?
Monica  Well, tonight waswas going to be my first time.
Chandler  With Roger? (Monica shyly looks away.) Not just with Roger?! (Monica
shrugs.) Oh my God!
Monica  All right relax Mr. Ive Had Sex Four Times!
Chandler  Four different women! Ive had sex way more times!
Monica  How many?
Chandler  Nine.
Monica  I was just waiting for the perfect guy.
Chandler  Well good, good for you. You really think that Roger is the perfect
guy?
Monica  No. Hes not a horrible guy.
Chandler  Hey thats what I tell girls about me.
Monica  Chandler, Im gonna die a virgin!
Chandler  No you are not! You are sweet and wonderful and this is gonna happen
for you.
Monica  Oh really? When? Do you wanna do it with me?
Chandler  Okay. (They both realize what he just said.)
Monica  I was kidding.
Chandler  So was I.
[Scene  Joey's apartment, Rachel is now three sheets to the wind and Joey is watching
her.]
Rachel  Joey, youre such an amazing actor! (He smiles.) How do you know
where Dr. Drake Remoray leaves off and Joey Tribbiani begins?
Joey  Well, with Dr. Drake they always tell me what to say. And with Joey, I
pretty much have to make it up on my own.
Rachel  Wow! Tell me something Joey(She falls off the couch)Whoa! I
just fell right off the couch there.
Joey  Yeah you did.
Rachel  Okay. (She climbs back onto the couch.)
Joey  Here you go. Let me ask you a question.
Rachel  Yeah?
Joey  When was the last time someone told you just how beautiful you are?
Rachel  Wow! I cant, I cant feel my hands.
Joey  Come, come here.
[Scene  Monica and Phoebe's, continued from earlier. Monica and Chandler are still
discussing the previous question.]
Chandler  We cant do this.
Monica  No! (They both laugh.) Oyster?
Chandler  Yeah! (Takes it.) If-if-if we did do this there would be a lot of
pressure on me, yknow? Because youve been waiting a very long time and I
wouldnt want to disappoint you.
Monica  Yeah but see I have nothing to compare it too. So even if youre
horrible, how would I know?
Chandler  I do like that.
Monica  Its harder for me! I have those four other women to compete with!
Chandler  Well, if it helps there were only three. So it would just be for
tonight, right?
Monica  Absolutely! It would just be one friend (Points at Chandler) helping out
another friend. (Points at herself.)
Chandler  Stop it! Were doing this! Lets do it!
Monica  Noo!! Okay!!
Chandler  Okay! (They both get up.)
Monica  Umm, do you have any uhh, moves?
Chandler  I have some moves.
Monica  I have no moves. (He moves in to kiss her and she laughs and backs
away.) Okay, whatcha doin there?! (Giggles.) Oh yknow what? Im sorry,
this is just too weird.
Chandler  Yeah, lets just forget it.
Monica  What if I turn out the lights? (Runs to shut them off.)
Chandler  Okay!
Chandler  Oh yeah.
Monica  Chandler?
Chandler  (sexily) Yeah?
Monica  Thats the couch.
[Scene  Monicas bedroom, she has just lost her flower to Chandler.]
Chandler  Oh my God!
Monica  I know! Ill tell you something, we are gonna do that again!
Chandler  Oh, okay! (He rolls over to do that again.)
[Scene  Joey's apartment, the next morning, Rachel is passed out on the couch.]
Joey  (entering) Morning!
Rachel  (wakes up suddenly and realizes where she is) Oh right.
Joey  Yeah.
Rachel  (groans) Oh God. Oh I cant believe Joey Tribbiani heard me throw
up!
Joey  Well he actually saw you a little bit too.
Rachel  Noo! Oh God we didwe didnt, we didnt uhh
Joey  No! No! No, not after seeing that.
Rachel  God Im just a horrible person.
Joey  Wh-why?
Rachel  Because Im married. Thats right, I am a married woman! And I
came to a TV stars apartment to have an affair! Uck!
Joey  Thats ridiculous! Im not a "Star," just a regular
famous actor.
Rachel  Yeah and Im a horrible, horrible person.
Joey  Rachel, would you stop saying that?! Hey-hey look, remember on the show
when-when Caprice was dying and she gave me
Rachel  The ring from the cave, yeah.
Joey  Wow! Uh okay, well uh (He gets up, opens a drawer, and pulls out the
ring.)
Rachel  (seeing the ring and gasping) Oh my God, they let you keep that stuff?!
Joey  Sure! As long as they dont find out you can keep whatever you want!
And I want you to have it.
Rachel  No! No-no-no
Joey  Yes! Yes!! And every time you look at it, I want you to remember that you
are a good person. Okay, youve had the chance to cheat, and with me, but you
didnt. And thats what this ring stands for.
Rachel  But I thought that ring stood for Caprices undying love for her
brother.
Joey  Look, do you want the ring or not?!
Rachel  Yeah!
[Scene  Phoebes hospital room, Joey and Ross enter as Phoebe comes out of the
bathroom wearing her robe.]
Ross  Hey!
Joey  Hey!
Ross  Look at you! Youre up!
Joey  All right!
Phoebe  I thought Id try to take a walk. Would you pour me some water?
Ill be back soon.
Joey  Whoa-whoa-whoa! Youre not gonna use the pay phone to call work, are
ya?
Phoebe  No. Ive learned my lesson.
Phoebe  Lets go! Come on! Move it! (Grabs her coat.) Come on! (To an old
man whos holding her shoes and briefcase.) Shoes! Briefcase! (Takes them both.)
Thanks Lou, good luck with the gall bladder. (She leaves.)
Ross  Hey Joe did Did you ever have a threesome?
Joey  (not quite sure of how to answer that) Well uh, look Ross I uh, I think
Carols great and Im sure youre a very attractive man, but I.
Ross  No! The reason Im asking is that I sorta had one last night.
Joey  You?
Ross  Yeah!
Joey  Wow!
Ross  Yeah!
Joey  All right! So, was it amazing?
Ross  It was, it was okay.
Joey  Just okayDid you do it right?!
Ross  Look, its just did, did you ever go to a party and think,
"Would really anyone miss me if I werent here?"
Joey  Huh. But still Ross, youre worst day with two women, pretty much
better than any other day! Yknow what I mean?
Ross  Oh-oh, absolutely!
Ross  Its just, my part seemed to be over pretty quickly and then, and
then there was a lot of waiting around.
Joey  But you got to be with both of them, right?
Ross  Not-not really. Th-th-there was just Carol.
Joey  Not the other one?
Ross  No, she kept kicking me away!
Joey  Yeah, you dont want that.
Ross  No!
Joey  Well hey, at least you got to see a lot of stuff, right?
Ross  Oh I a lot of stuff!
Joey  You got a little bored?
Ross  A little. Yeah. I made a snack.
Joey  Yeah? What did ya have?
Ross  Just a sandwich. Turkey, a little mustard
Joey  Sounds good.
Ross  It really was!
[Scene  Monica and Phoebe's, Monica is making a sandwich as Chandler enters.]
Chandler  Hey!
Monica  Hey!
Chandler  Let me tell you about this chick I scored with last night! Oh no wait
a minute that was you!
Monica  Hey, check me out, Im a slut!
Chandler  So you uh, want to do something tonight?
Monica  Oh I cant. Dr. Roger is coming over again.
Chandler  Oh. Oh right! Right! Because youre still seeing him and uh,
hes a good guy. I mean, I remember a time when (He fakes falling asleep.)
Monica  Are you okay?
Chandler  Yeah! Totally! Totally, and you?
Monica  Great! Its so amazing! I mean, last time Dr. Roger came over, I
was so nervous, but then after being with you Im all like, "Can the
doctor see me now?"
Chandler  I bet he can.
Monica  Yknow, I dont have an appointment, but I sure could use a
physical. (He laughs halfheartedly) Are you sure youre okay?
Chandler  Oh yeah! Yeah! Dont worry about me, Ill be fine! (Does a
kara-tay move.)
[Scene  Rachel and Barrys bedroom, Rachel is returning from her disastrous
attempt at an affair to find that Barry was much, much more successful with his.]
Rachel  Ohh! My God! Barry!!
Barry  You-you-you said you were gonna be away all weekend!
Rachel  Oh thats right! Im sorry! I-I am early! Finish! Please!!
[Scene  Phoebes office, she is arriving without the knowledge that shes
been fired.]
Phoebe  Surprise! Look whos back!
Arthur 
Phoebe  Hey!
Arthur 
Phoebe  Uh, I dont think so!
Jack  Phoebe?
Phoebe  Jack!! Hey!
Jack  What are you doing here?
Phoebe  All better! Back to work! Except this clown from research told me I was
fired. He should do his research, huh?
Jack  Well, you were fired.
Phoebe  Nu-uh!
Jack  I told that guy who answered your phone.
Phoebe  Oh, okay I didnt get that message. So this doesnt
countAnyway, Ill be in my office.
Jack  Uh, Phoebe you-you dont have an office.
Phoebe  Thats all right, Ill work here. This is goo, next to this
plant. (She picks a place in the lobby next to a plant.)
Jack  (approaches her) Phoebe, listen
Phoebe  Youre in my office! Look, I have made a lot of cash for this
company! Okay? I am talking big bucks! Pesos! Yen! Rubles! You make one little
mistake
Jack  You lost 13 million dollars.
Phoebe  Oh, so this is all about money! Yknow its bad enough
thatOw! Oh, you have got to be kidding!
Jack  Are you all right?
Phoebe  Im having another heart attack!
Jack  What?!
Phoebe  Im having another heart attack!! Call 9-1-1!!
Jack  Take it easy. (Sits her down.)
Phoebe  (to Arthur, hes the guy calling 9-1-1) Dumbass!
Woman  Hey Pheebs! Hows it going?!
Phoebe  Well, they fired me and Im having heart attack.
Woman  Wow! Well, welcome back!
Phoebe  Yeah.
[Scene  Central Perk, Ross is there as Rachel storms in.]
Rachel  Hi Ross!
Ross  Hey Rachel.
Rachel  Is Joey Tribbiani here?
Ross  Umm, no.
Rachel  Well, if you see him, will you please tell him that Im looking for
him and that this I am not gonna throw up!
Ross  That-thats always good news. Are you okay?
Rachel  Me? Im great! Im fine! Im sooo good!! But, you know
whos not great?! Men! Youre a man right Ross?!
Ross  Yeah.
Rachel  Sit down!
Ross  Okay. (He does so.)
Rachel  Let me uh, let me ask you something, do wedding vows mean squat
to you people?! And why is it that the second we tell you were going out of
town, bamn there you are in bed with the neighbors dog walker?!
Ross  Were sorry.
Rachel  No seriously! Seriously! What has happened to the sanctity of
marriage?
Ross  Didnt you spend last night at Joeys?
Rachel  Aw what are you?! A detective?
Ross  Look I-I dont know whats going on with you and your husband
and what is hopefully an adult dog walker, look can I just say not all men are like that.
Rachel  Oh. (Doesnt believe it.)
Ross  Hey! There are some men who will do whatever it takes to make their
marriage work! Okay? There are some men who will stand by and-and watch as their wives
engage in-in what only can be described as a twosome with some-some woman she
barely knows from the gym!
Rachel  Who are these men?
Ross  Men. I guy I know.
Rachel  Well, you might want to tell him it sounds like his wife is (whispers)
gay.
Ross  She is not (Realizes) Shes gay. Oh my God. She is so
gay! I cant believe this.
Rachel  Good day for married people huh?
Ross  Im sorry your husband cheated on you.
Rachel  Im sorry your wife is gay. I guess women arent that great
either.
Ross  Try telling my wife that.
[Scene  Monica and Phoebe's, Monica is blowing out a candle as Chandler enters.]
Chandler  (sticking his head in the door) Okay to come in?
Monica  Yeah, come on, eat, whatever you want. Dr. Roger got beeped again.
Chandler  Yeah I know, guess who beeped him?
Monica  What?!
Chandler  Im the ruptured spleen. (Laughs.)
Monica  Why would you do that?
Chandler  Because you shouldnt be with him. (Pause.) You should be with
me.
Monica  Really?
Chandler  Yeah! When you were talking about Roger, that was killing me! Look,
things like last night they dont just happen. Yknow? Or at least not to me. Or
with the other two women, in the morning yknow I was just lying there and I
couldnt wait to just go hang out with my friends, but with you I always yknow
with a friend.
Monica  Chandler!
Chandler  I know you probably dont want to go out with me, yknow
because I make too many jokes and Ive never been in a serious relationship and I
guess Im not technically a "doctor"
Monica  There was just one woman, wasnt there?
Chandler  No, there were two.
Monica  Including me?
Chandler  Oh yeah.
[Scene  Central Perk, Phoebe is singing a new song as the gang looks on.]
Phoebe  (singing)

[Scene  Central Perk, Ross, Chandler, and Phoebe are there. Joey is working.]
Ross  Hey, remember when I had a monkey?
Chandler  Yeah.
Ross  Yeah, what, what was I thinking?
Joey  (hes just picked up their bill) Hey! So, whats with the 20
percent tip? Did I do something wrong?
Chandler  Twenty percent is a pretty generous tip Joe.
Joey  Yknow whats more generous than that?! Fifty percent!
Yknow whats even more generous than that?!!
Chandler  I see where youre goin!
Ross  Whats up with the greed Joe?
Joey  All right, look Im sorry you guys, but its just that I gotta
get these new head shots made. And theyre really expensive, yknow? Im
down to like three! Well, actually two cause one of em I kinda blackened in
some teethWhy did I do that?! (Hits himself in the head.)
Ross  Well isnt there something you can do to earn a little extra money? I
mean, cant-cant you pick up, I dont know, an extra shift here?
Phoebe  Or, yknow, I used to beg for money. Of course it helps if
youve got yknow a little of this (she sticks her chest out and shakes it)
goin on. Wow! I still have it!
Ross  Oh, wait! Wait! Dont you have an audition today? Yeah! Maybe
youll get that job!
Joey  Oh, ha-ha-ha! Ooh! Wait a minute, I used to get medical experiments down
on me all the time!
Chandler  (reminiscing) Ah, finally an explanation.
Joey  No-no! I used to get paid for all kinds of medical stuff, remember?
Lets see uh, well I dont want to donate sperm again. (To Ross) I really prefer
doing that at the home office yknow? (Ross nods his head.) Ooh-ooh, maybe they want
like some of my blood or-or spit or something, huh?
Gunther  (approaching with a tray with an order on it) Joey!
Joey  Yeah?
Gunther  What did I tell you about talking to your friends while youre
working?
Joey  Uhh do it?
Gunther  That guy (points) has been waiting for his coffee for ten minutes!
Hes complained about you three times! (He hands the coffee cup to Joey, assuming
that Joey will deliver it and walks away.)
Joey  Well, where was I? (Takes a sip of the coffee.)
[Scene  Central Perk, Ross is there as Phoebe and Rachel enter wearing workout
clothes.]
Ross  Hi!
Phoebe  Hey!
Ross  Hey, what have you guys been up to?
Phoebe  Ohh! We went to a self-defense class today!
Ross  Wow!
Rachel  Yeah, kicking a guy in the crotch all morning really takes it out of ya!
Joey  Takes it out of you? (Laughs.)
Phoebe  Now, we can kick anybodys ass!
Rachel  Yeah!
Ross  After one class? I dont think so.
Rachel  What? You wanna see me self-defend myself?! Go over there (points) and
pretend youre a sexual predator! Go on! I dare ya!!
Ross  Well, of course you can defend yourself from an attack you know is coming,
thats not enough. Look, I studying kara-tay for a long time, and theres a
concept you should really be familiar with. Its what the Japanese call (he holds two
fingers up to his temple, and he does this every time he says this word) unagi.
Rachel  Isnt that a kind of sushi?
Ross  No, its a concept!
Phoebe  Yeah it is! It is! Its freshwater eel!
Ross  All right, maybe it means that too
Rachel  Ohh! I would kill for a salmon skin roll right now!
Ross  Yknow what? Fine! Get attacked! I dont even care!
Phoebe  (deadpan) Come on Ross. Were sorry. Please tell us what it is.
Ross  Unagi is a state of total awareness. Okay? Only by achieving true unagi
can you be prepared for any danger that may befall you!
Phoebe  You mean in case someone is trying to steal your bamboo sleeping mat or
your kettle of fish?
Ross  (moves closer) All Im saying is, its one thing being prepared
for an attack against like each other; whole another story being prepared for an attack, I
dont know, like a (turns and puts his face close to Rachels and screams) surprise!!
Ross  All right, you know that one was coming, but that doesnt mean you
have unagi. (Does the finger thing.)
Rachel  (To Phoebe) Ooh! Yknow what? If we made reservations, we could
have unagi in about a half-hour.
Ross  Yknow what (Moves away as Chandler enters, panicked.)
Chandler  Hey-hey, is Monica here?
Phoebe  No.
Ross  No.
Chandler  Okay, look I need your help, I dont know what to get her for
Valentines Day.
Rachel  Well, Valentines Day was like two weeks ago, so I wouldnt
get her a calendar!
Chandler  (laughs) She was working on Valentines Day so were
celebrating it tonight.
Joey  Ohh, hey! Why dont you book a date for both of you at one of those
romantic spas?
Phoebe  Ooh, Joey, thats actually a really good idea!
Joey  And of course, crotchless panties.
Chandler  Well appealing as that does sound to her boyfriend (pause) and her
brother, (the camera pans to Ross flashing Joey a very evil look; Joey gets scared) I
cant do that we promised wed make each other gifts this year.
Rachel  Aw, I love that.
Phoebe  You guys!
Joey  You cant make crotchless panties? You take, you take a pair of
scissors and you just cut
Rachel  (interrupting him) Okay-okay-okay! So, making things. That sounds like
so much fun.
Chandler  Yeah, I thought so to until I paper mached one of my eyes shut.
Phoebe  Oh, I love paper mache! What did you make?
Chandler  I made a (Does one of those gibberish words.)
Phoebe  What is that?
Chandler  Nothing!
Ross  So what are you gonna do?
Chandler  Well, have you guys made anything that maybe I can take credit for?
Phoebe  Ohh! I have! I have! I started making these little sock bunnies! (She
takes out a sock thats been made into a bunny with eyes, nose, mouth, whiskers, and
two other socks sown onto it for ears.) Oh for crying out loud!
Rachel  Hey, wait a minute! That is my sock!
Phoebe  Now, its you little bunny friend. (She sticks it in Rachels
face and they both laugh.)
[Scene  Monica and Chandler's, Chandler is desperately trying to make his
Valentines Day gift. He takes a paper cup, turns it upside down, sticks two pencils
into the top, and hangs a coat hanger from the bottom.]
Chandler  (admiring his work) This, this actually is a (Does the same
gibberish word from before.)
Monica  (entering) Hey!
Chandler  Hey! Honey, can I ask you a question about the Valentines Day
gifts?
Monica  Oh, yeah.
Chandler  Do we have to make the entire thing?
Monica  Yes! Why, did youyou forget to make yours?
Chandler  Of course, of course not. I just have to uh, go over to the place
where I-I made it and pick-pick it up.
Monica  Okay. (They kiss.) Okay, I cant wait! This is going to be the best
Valentines Day ever! (Chandler giggles and exits.) I cant believe it! Make the
presents! Make the presents!
Chandler  (sticking his head back in) What?
Monica  Im just so excited to make the presents! (Chandler does another
sarcastic/scared laugh and leaves.) Shoot!
[Scene  A Medical Research Office, Joey is there to sign up for an experiment, any
experiment.]
Joey  (to the receptionist) Hi uh, Im Joey Tribbiani and with all do
respect Id like to donate some fluids.
Receptionist  Were actually at the end of one of our research cycles, so
were not looking for applicants right now.
Joey  Oh thats too bad. Ive kinda been saving up. (She just looks at
him in horror.) Uh, are you sure theres no studies I can participate in?
Receptionist  Well, heres a schedule of whats coming up. (Hands it
to him.)
Joey  Thanks. (Starts to read it.) Well but this one starts now. (Points to
one.)
Receptionist  Oh that one is available now, but only identical twins are
eligible. Its a twins study.
Joey  But its $2,000.
Receptionist  Sorry.
Joey  Well how about this one? Testing the effects of Joey Tribbiani on
attractive nurse receptionists.
Receptionist  We already got the results back on that on, and theyre not
good. (Joey beats a hasty retreat.)
[Scene  The Hallway between the Apartments, Ross is hiding behind that bump out on
Monicas side waiting for Phoebe and Rachel. As they come up the stairs, he jumps out
and yells]
Ross  DANGER!!! DANGER!!!!!
Phoebe  Ross!!!
Rachel  What the hell was that?!
Ross  A lesson in the importance of unagi. (He starts doing the finger thing
every time now.)
Phoebe  Ohh, youre a freak!!
Ross  Perhaps. Now Im curious, at what point during those girlish screams
would you have begun to kick my ass?
Rachel  All right, so we werent prepared!
Ross  Im sorry I had to take such drastic measures to make my point, but
Ilook, I just want you guys to be safe. (Monica comes out to throw out the garbage
and Ross screams) DANGER!!!!! (She completely ignores him and keeps walking.)
Ahhh, huh? Unagi.
[Scene  Cole-Geddes Casting Agency, Joey is there on his audition and thinking about
that 2,000 bucks for the twins study.]
Joey  (in his head) 2,000 bucks is a lot of money. Oh, I wish I had a twin.
Where could I find someone who looks exactly like me? (The camera widens its shot to
reveal a room full of Joey look-a-likes. Joey looks at the guy next to him and then back
at his script.)
[Scene  Ross's apartment, Ross is coming in from doing his laundry. He starts folding
it as Chandler enters.]
Chandler  Hey.
Ross  (not turning around) Chandler. I sensed it was you.
Chandler  What?!
Ross  Unagi. Im always aware.
Chandler  Okay, are you aware unagi (does the finger thing) is an eel?
Ross  Whats up?
Chandler  I cant figure out what to make Monica.
Ross  Oh, why dont you make her one of your little jokes.
Chandler  Im going crazy! Okay? Do you have any thing around here that
looks homemade?
Ross  Yknow what? Shed-shed love this. (Picks up a model of
the Saturn V rocket, thats the one that took man to the moon.) Uh, its an
exact replica of Apollo 8. I made it in the sixth grade.
Chandler  Yeah, I guess I could use that. I could say that your love sends me to
the moon.
Ross  Yeah-yeah, except Apollo 8 didnt actually land on the moon. But
you-you-you could write that umm, your love lets me orbit the moon twice and return
safely. (Apollo 8 was the first one that orbited the moon and the one that read the
Christmas Story from the orbit of the moon on Christmas Eve, 1968. They also took the
famous Earthrise picture of the Earth rising over the moon.)
Chandler  Wait a minute, I cant give this to her.
Ross  Why not?
Chandler  Because it says "Captain Ross" on the side and "I hate
Monica" on the bottom.
Ross  Oh.
Phoebe and Rachel  DANGER
Rachel  Ahhhhh, salmon skin roll. (She does the finger thing.)
[Scene  Monica and Chandlers bedroom, hes still trying to figure out what
to make Monica.]
Chandler  Okay. Okay. (He goes to the closet, moves the clothes out of the way,
and notices an empty hanger. He takes the empty hanger and bends it all out of shape. Then
he holds it out as if hes giving it to her.) Yes honey, I made it myself. (He throws
it down and goes to her chest, grabs something, goes to the bed table, and takes out a
pair of scissors. He turns around and holds the scissors to the crotch of the panties he
just removed.) I cant do it. I cant do it. (He throws them both down and
continues looking. He opens another closet door and finds a tape.) Oh! Oh! A mixed tape! A
mixed tape!! (He runs out into the living room.)
Chandler  Hey! Hi! You uh, ready to exchange gifts?
Monica  Sure! Okay, you go first.
Chandler  Okay, come here! Come here.
Monica  Okay! (She takes her present for him and they move over to sit on the
couch.)
Chandler  Now, its not wrapped because I just, just finished it.
Monica  Okay.
Chandler  But I made you a tape of what I think are all romantic songs.
Monica  Oh, what a great gift! Is The Way You Look Tonight on it?!
Chandler  (momentarily terrified) Maybe well have to listen and see!
Monica  Oh, I love it! Thank you so much!
Chandler  Okay!
Monica  Okay, you ready to open yours?
Chandler  Yeah!
Monica  Okay.
Chandler  Its a sock bunny.
Monica  Yeah-yeah, you remember how I call you bunny?
Chandler  Not really.
Monica  Well, I did one time, and-and I want to start doing it more. See
thats what this is about.
Chandler  I see. Yknow umm, Phoebe makes sock bunnies.
Monica  No! No, she doesnt. Uh Phoebe, what she makesthats
uhtheyre sock rabbits. They are completely differentOkay! Okay! Okay! I
didnt make it! Im sorry! I totally forgot about tonight and the fact that
were supposed to make the presents!
Chandler  Oh, its okay. I dont
Monica  No-no, its not okay! Its not! I mean you were just
Youre so incredible! You went through all this time and effort to make this tape for
me! Yknow Im just gonnaI, I am gonna make this up to you! I will! I-I am
going to cook anything you want in here (points to the kitchen), and I am going to do
anything you want in there! (Points to the bedroom.)
Chandler  (thinking it over) Well, I did put a lot of thought in the tape. (They
both run into the bedroom.)
[Scene  Monica and Chandlers bedroom, they are relaxing in sexual bliss.]
Chandler  Wow! (To the sock bunny still on his hand.) You are way to
young to have seen that!
Monica  Oops! (Covers its eyes.) Yknow, your birthday is in a
month-and-a-half, what do you say I forget to get you a present for that too?
Chandler  You are totally and completely 100% forgiven.
Monica  We have got to wash that! (Referring to the sock bunny.)
Chandler  Yeah! (Takes it off his hand and throws it behind the night-stand.)
Monica  Do you remember that jacket that you love so much, that you thought was
too expensive?
Chandler  You have done enough!
Monica  I wanna wake up early and go get it for you!
Chandler  No you dontget it in black, not brown.
Monica  Oop, your cake is ready!
Chandler  Oop!
Chandler  Well, its like that old saying, have some sex, eat some cake.
Joey's Look-A-Like  Hey Mon! Hey Chann! (He goes to the fridge) Just
gettin a soda! (Does so.)
Monica  Who the hell are you?!
Joey's Look-A-Like  Im Joey! How are you doin?!
Joey  (entering) No! No! No! No! No! How you doin?! How you
doinDamnit Carl! Go wait in the hall! (Goes into the hall.)
Joey  Look, I got to apologize on the behalf of Carl.
Chandler  Who the hell is Carl?!
Joey  Oh, did I not mention? Carl is a guy I hired to be my identical twin for a
medical research project.
Chandler  Yknow sometimes the good ideas are just right in front of you,
arent they?
Joey  Okay, I know it sounds crazy, but I think it might work. Yknow? The
only problem is, Carls acting is (Does the international hand symbol for
so-so.)
Monica  The only problem!
Joey  Yeah, hes the reason I didnt get that big Minute Maid
commercial a couple of years ago remember? We were supposed to be brothers, but he messed
it up.
Carl  (sticking his head back in) Hey, uh can I get a little piece of that cake?
Joey  (to Carl) Pizza!! We like Pizza!! Get out!!! (Carl does so.)
[Scene  Phoebe and Rachel's, Phoebe and Rachel are returning.]
Phoebe  Pat Sajak?
Rachel  Yep!
Phoebe  Alex Trebek?
Rachel  Oh, of course!
Phoebe  Chuck Woolery?
Rachel  Definitely! Phoebe, you will not find a single game show host,
whos ass I cannot kick.
Rachel  Say it!
Phoebe  Say we are unagi!
Ross  Its not something you are! Its something you have!
Rachel  Say it!
Ross  Yknow what? I can easily get out of this, but there is a chance you
can get very, very hurt!
[Scene  The Medical Research office, Joey is there with Carl in the waiting room. Two
identical twins come out and both wave by at the same time.]
Joey  All right Carl, were next. Now remember, what is not gonna be?
Carl  Another Minute Maid fiasco.
Joey  Thats right! And what are you not gonna do?
Carl  Well, Im not gonna talk because
Joey  (gets very angry) Damnit Carl! (Carl goes to say something more, and Joey
silences him with a grunt.)
The Doctor  (entering) (To the receptionist) Can I have the next one please?
(Takes the form.) Joey and Tony Tribbiani. (Joey and Carl stand up.)
Joey  Thats us.
The Doctor  (seeing theyre not identical) But uh, this is a study for
identical twins.
Joey  Thats right, $2,000.
The Doctor  But, youre not identical twins.
Joey  Damnit Carl!
[Scene  Monica and Chandler's, Monica is getting ready for Chandlers arrival. He
enters and finds the place lit with candles and dinner on the table.]
Chandler  Oh my good God.
Monica  Hey! Continuing the countdown of your favorite meals. Tonight, No. 3,
macaroni and cheese with cut up hot dogs.
Chandler  Look, you have done enough! Okay? You have to stop this now.
Monica  I will! But not tonight. For dinner music, I thought we could listen to
that tape you made me.
Chandler  Oh, the mixed tape.
Monica  The Way You Look Tonight is on here! Dance with me?
Monica  You are just the sweetest. (They kiss.)
Janice 
Chandler  No! Youre the sweetest! (He tries to kiss her but Monica backs
away with a look that could kill on her face.)
[Scene  A womens self-defense class, the instructor is just finishing a class.]
The Instructor  Okay ladies, that ends todays class, and lets
remember, lets be safe out there.
Ross  Its a great class.
The Instructor  Thanks.
Ross  Yeah, yeah, I was watching. (The instructor just nods and walks away.)
Umm, hey, a couple of questions though. Umm, about that-that-that last move where the
woman tripped you and then pinned you to the floor, what-what-what-what would you do next?
The Instructor  Well, she would take her keys and try to jam them
Ross  No. No-no. No. What would you do next?
The Instructor  Who? Me the attacker?
Ross  Yes thats right.
The Instructor  Why?
Ross  I tired attacking two women, did not work.
The Instructor  What?!
Ross  No, I mean its okay, I mean, theyre-theyre my friends.
In fact, I-I-I was married to one of them.
The Instructor  Let me get this straight man, you attacked your ex-wife?!
Ross  Oh, no! No-no! No, I tired! But I couldnt. Thats why Im
here. Maybe we could attack them together? (He glares at him.) That-thats a no.
[Scene  Monica and Chandler's, Chandler is trying to explain himself to Monica.]
Chandler  I am so, so, so, so sorry!
Monica  (not buying it) Uh-huh.
Chandler  And I will cook anything you want in here (points to the kitchen), and
do anything in there! (Points to the bedroom.)
Monica  (pointing to the kitchen) Yeah you will! (Points to the bedroom) And,
are you kiddin me?!
Chandler  Come on Monica, its our Valentines Day. Please?
Please-please, please?
Monica  Okay.
Chandler  Okay. (They hug.)
Janices Voice 
Chandler  So, are we going in there?
Monica  I am!! (Enter her room and closes the door behind her.)
Janices Voice 
[Scene  The street in front of Central Perk, Ross is walking up and sees two women that
look like Phoebe and Rachel from behind.]
Ross  Ah-ha, nowhere to run! (He starts to run towards them.)
Rachel  I dont like sitting up here! Im just gonna over (She
starts to get up.)
Phoebe  (stopping her) No Rachel! They got here first!
Phoebe  Why is Ross doing that?
Ross  DANGER!!!!
Rachel  Oh my God! Why is he jumping on those women!
Phoebe  We should help him!
Rachel  I Well, I dont think they need any help.
[Scene  Monica and Chandler's, Chandler, Rachel, and Joey are there as Ross enters.]
Ross  Hey! I just got uh, my teacher evaluations! Check out what this one
student wrote, "I loved Dr. Gellers class. Mind blowing lectures! Dr. Geller,
you are definitely the hottie of the paleontology department!"
Chandler  Ahh, Hotties of the Paleontology Department, theres a big
selling calendar, eh?
Rachel  Who wrote it?
Ross  Oh, I wish I knew, but the evaluations are all anonymous.
Joey  Oh hey, do you still have their final exams?
Ross  Yeah.
Joey  Oh, cause you can just match the evaluation to the exam with the
same handwriting and boom, theres your admirer. (Ross is stunned.)
Chandler  A hot girls at stake and all of the sudden hes Rain Man.
Rachel  Okay, wait a minute, wait a minute, why are we so sure that this is a
girl?
Ross  Its a girl! Anyway, it wouit wouldnt matter. Okay?
Because Im a teacher and shes a student.
Chandler  Oh, is that against the rules?
Ross  No, but it is frowned upon.
Chandler  I see.
Ross  Besides, theres a big age difference.
Joey  Oh, well think of it like this, when youre 90
Ross  I know when Im 90 shell be like 80 and it wont seem like
such a big difference.
Joey  No thats not what I was going to say at all. No, what I was going to
say is when youre 90 youll still have the memory of what it was like to be
with a 20-year-old.
[Scene  Monica and Chandler's, Phoebe, Monica, and Chandler are eating breakfast as
Joey enters.]
Joey  Hey Chandler! Yknow that girl you went to college with who-who
became a movie director?
Chandler  Oh yeah, Dana Keystone. She was in my Movement class.
Phoebe  Whats a Movement class?
Monica  Its Chandlers way of pretending he didnt take mime.
Joey  Oh well listen, anyway shes directing the new Al Pacino movie. You
gotta get me an audition!
Chandler  Oh, I dont know man. I havent talked to her in like ten
years.
Joey  No-no-no, please-please Chandler I-I-I would owe you so much!
Chandler  You do owe me so much. You owe me three thousand, four
hundred
Joey  Hey-hey dude, why are you changing the subject? Why? Will you make the
call or what?
Chandler  Oh okay, Ill-Ill try.
Joey  All right! Thanks! Youre the best! Now listen, the last day of
auditions is Thursday. Okay? So I gotta get in there by Thursday. Okay? Just remember
Thursday. Thursday. Can you remember Thursday?
Chandler  Yeah so, Tuesday?
Joey  (angrily) Thursday! Look if you need help remembering think of like this,
the third day. All right? Monday, one day. Tuesday, two day. Wednesday, when? Huh? What
day? Thursday! The third day! Okay?!
Chandler  (sarcastically) Thank you.
Joey  Okay.
Rachel  (entering from the bathroom) Hey Mon? Im gonna check my messages.
Chandler  You just thought of that in there?
Monica  Yeah sure, nature called, she wanted to see who else did.
Rachel  (on phone) Hello? (Shocked that someone answered.) Uh, Rachel. (To the
gang.) Great, someone is in our apartment. Call the cops!
Monica  Youre on the phone!
Rachel  (on phone) Oh my God! Oh my God! Thank you! (Hangs up) That was the fire
department, there was a fire at our place!
Phoebe  Oh my God! How bad was it?
Rachel  Well, he didnt say, but it was a fire. Im guessing not very
good. Come on, we gotta go!
Monica  Come on! (The girls all run out and Joey holds up Chandler by smiling.)
Chandler  What are you smiling about? What is so funny?
Joey  The part I want to audition for is a fireman, this is so meant to be!
[Scene  N.Y.U. Paleontology department, Ross is putting up the grades on the message
board.]
Burt  (another professor) Wow! It looks like you were very generous with your
grades this semester! (Ross frantically starts to change some as a female student,
Elizabeth, approaches.)
Elizabeth 
Ross  (startled) Yeah?
Elizabeth 
Ross  Oh thank you. Thanks very much. (Leans up against the board and on a
thumbtack.) Ow! (He pulls away.)
Elizabeth 
Ross  That was you?
Elizabeth 
Ross  Oh I, I dont-I dont think that would be the best idea.
Elizabeth 
Ross  What time?
Elizabeth 
Ross  Gotcha. (Starts to leave.)
Elizabeth 
Ross  Oh! So-so seriously, what time?
[Scene  Phoebe and Rachel's, everyone minus Ross are arriving to inspect the damage.
The fire department is still there.]
Phoebe  Coming through! (Has to dodge a fireman) Oh! Coming through! (Sees a
cute one.) Oh! Hello! Hi! (Smiles then realizes) No! Right! Coming through!
Monica  Oh well, its not so bad.
Fireman #1  Yeah, most of the damage is pretty mostly contained in the bedrooms.
Phoebe  Oh!
Rachel  My God! (They both run into the bedrooms.)
Joey  (to the fireman) Hey buddy, do you think I can borrow your uniform this
Thursday?
Fireman #1  Excuse me?
Monica  Joey! Hes working! (To Chandler) You would look good in
that.
Joey  Oh, how bad is it?
Phoebe  Oh, its bad. Its really bad. The only thing in there that
isnt burned is an ass. Which I do not remember buying!
Chandler  Hows your room Rach?
Rachel  Everythings ruined. My bed. My clothes. Look at my favorite blue
sweater. (Hold it up.)
Monica  Isnt that mine?
Rachel  Fine! Im sorry for your loss! (Hands it back to her.)
Fireman #1  So uh, youre not gonna be able to live here for a while, you
ladies have a place to stay?
Rachel  (stands up) Wow! Oh-okay, look pal, I am not in the mood to be
hit on right now! But if you give me your number I will call you some other time.
Monica  (pulling Rachel back down) Yes, they can stay with us.
Chandler  Have you figured out what started the fire Mr. Fireman?
Fireman #1  Well uh, do either of you smoke?
Phoebe  No, not usually. But yeah, I could use one right now.
Fireman #1  No-no-no, do you uh light candles? Burn incense?
Phoebe  Yes! I do! All the time! I love them! Oh my God! I did it! Its me!
Its me! I burned down the house! I burned down the house!
Rachel  Okay Phoebe calm down, theres no need to place blame. Okay? (To
the fireman) I warned her about those candles.
[Scene  Monica and Chandler's, Chandler is on the phone as Joey enters.]
Chandler  God, its great to catch up! I cant believe how long
its been!
Joey  Chandler, is that (Mimes someone using a movie camera and Chandler
nods yes.)
Chandler  (on phone) Oh thats great! Good for you.
Joey  Hey-hey listen (Chandler waves him away.)
Chandler  Okay! So yeah, maybe we can get together umm (Joey mimes
throwing something in the air, catching it, rolling it out, putting it in an oven and
cutting it.) Can you hold for one second please? (To Joey) What?!
Joey  When youre off the phone, do you wanna get a pizza?
Chandler  (on phone) Hi! Im back. (Goes to hang up the phone.) Yeah, that
sounds great. (Listens) Okay. Well, well do it then. (Listens) Okay, bye-bye. (He
hangs up the phone and turns around to see Joey standing close to him and screams.)
Joey  Hey listen, so whens-whens my audition? I mean I know
its Thursday, but what time?
Chandler  Hi.
Monica  Hey!
Chandler  (To Joey) We didnt get to the audition. Im gonna take her
to coffee and then well do it then.
Joey  Ah-ha!
Monica  Wow! So, now youre going on a date with this girl?
Chandler  Honey, it is not a date! I havent talked to her in ten years!
You cant just call up somebody you havent talked to in ten years and ask them
for a favor. There are rules, yknow? You gotta, you got to put in some time.
Monica  Youre right, Im sorry. Its not like youre
yknow, going out with an ex-girlfriend.
Chandler  No, we only went out once.
Monica  You dated her!
Chandler  Not once!
Monica  All right, well why dont I go out with an ex-boyfriend and do Joey
a favor?!
Joey  Hey, you wanna do Joey a favor, maybe you go out with Joey. (He turns
around to see Chandler glaring at him.)
[Scene  Central Perk, Chandler is having coffee with Dana.]
Chandler  (laughs) Oh thats great, my friend Joeys in the movie
business.
Dana  Yknow who I ran into from school? Howie.
Chandler  (giggles) My friends name is Joey.
Dana  Apparently Howies editing now. Yeah, he-he-he calls me up and asks
me if he can edit my new movie. Can you believe that?! Yknow I-I-I havent
spoken to him in like ten years and he asks me for a favor!
Chandler  Yeah, Ive always hated that Howie.
Dana  No, no "How you doing?" Man, I mean not even a cup of coffee
first!
Chandler  The nerve huh?
Dana  Yeah!
Chandler  Refill?
[Scene  Monica and Chandler's, Monica is about to debut Hotel Monica (formerly known as
Rachels Room) to Phoebe and Rachel.]
Monica  Now, this is last minute so I want to apologize for the mess. Okay?
Rachel  Oh my God! It sure didnt look this way when I lived here.
Monica  I know! Now look, theres only one problem though. Theres
only room for one, so I guess one of you will have to stay at Joeys.
Phoebe  Well, since the fire was kinda my fault I guess (To Rachel) you should
get to stay here.
Rachel  Hey! Hey-hey, now this was no ones fault Pheebs. Okay? It was an
accident.
Phoebe  Well no, it was my fault so you should get the nice room.
Rachel  Okay! (She jumps on the bed.)
Monica  So Rach! Youre the first guest at Hotel Monica! Umm, youll
just have to tell me how you like your eggs in the morning. And I thought I would bring
them to you, yknow, in bed. Oh, you have been through so much.
Rachel  I have.
[Scene  Joey's apartment, Joey is showing Phoebe around.]
Joey  This right here is where I keep the pizza. (He points to the chair.) And
uh thats where the napkin is. (Points to the floor next to the chair.)
Phoebe  Whats that smell?
Joey  I know! (Shrugs his shoulders.)
[Scene  A street, Ross is walking with Elizabeth on their date.]
Elizabeth  Oh please! It was such a big class! You never even noticed me!
Ross  What? Of course I did! You uh, you sat next to Sleepy Sleeperson.
Elizabeth  Who?
Ross  Oh uh, I had trouble remembering everyones name, so I-I kinda came
up with nicknames. Like the guy on the other side of you was Smelly von Brownshirt.
Elizabeth  Oh yeah. So umm, did you have a nickname for me?
Ross  Umm, no. No.
Elizabeth  Yes you did! What was it?
Ross  Umm, its Cutie McPretty.
Elizabeth  Ohh thats so sweet!
Ross  Listen, I gotta tell ya, I-Im having a great time! Yknow how
before you said it might be weird, the whole student teacher thing, and to be frank I
thought it would be too, but its not. I mean its not at all.
Burt  (exiting from a restaurant) Dr. Geller!
Ross  (pushing Elizabeth into a doorway) Burt!
[Scene  Phoebe and Rachel's, Phoebe and Rachel are cleaning up the mess.]
Phoebe  So did you sleep well last night?
Rachel  I did.
Phoebe  Yeah?
Rachel  I did, Monica was so sweet she left a little mint on my pillow.
Phoebe  Yknow what Joey left on my pillow?
Rachel  What?
Phoebe  Gum!
Fireman #2  Well, we determined the cause of the fire.
Phoebe  Yeah I know, it was my candle. My candle!
Fireman #2  No, there was an appliance left on in the bathroom. Its looks
like a curling iron.
Phoebe  I dont use a curling iron.
Fireman #2  Well someone does.
Rachel  Well, dont look at me! My hairs straight! Straight!
Straight! Straight!
Fireman #2  It couldve been a hair straightener.
Rachel  Oh.
[Scene  Joey's apartment, Joey is now showing Rachel around.]
Joey  This is where I keep the pizza. (Its the same location as before.)
AndHey! Where did the napkin go?! (The napkin is not in its spot.)
[Scene  Monica and Chandler's, Phoebe is reading and Monica runs over and turns on the
lamp behind Phoebe.]
Monica  Now there you go! I wouldnt want my best guest to strain her eyes!
Phoebe  Thanks Monica!
Monica  Does that smell bother you?
Phoebe  What the smell from Joeys? No, I can hardly smell it over here.
Monica  Well you let me know if you can, because yknow I can bake a pie to
cover it.
Phoebe  I can smell it a little, bake the pie.
Monica  Okay!
Phoebe  Okay.
Monica  Hello? (Listens) Oh yes, one minute please. (To Phoebe) Its for
you. Its the fire inspector.
Phoebe  Oh! (Takes the phone.) Hello? (Listens) Yeah this is Phoebe. (Listens)
Really?!
Joey  (in a funny voice) Yeah, so it turns out that it wasnt the hair
straightener that started the fire. (Rachel prompts him on what to say next.) No-no, it
was the candles. Its very not good leaving candles unattended. In fact, one of the
first things they teach you in fire school is (Phoebe suddenly enters.) Uhh
Uhh Okay. Well, I have to go now. (Phoebe leaves.)
[Scene  Joey's apartment, Ross is telling Monica and Joey about his date with
Elizabeth.]
Ross  We had such a great time! Shes-shes incredible! I thought
the-the age difference might be a problem, but it wasnt. It wasnt at all.
Elizabeth is very mature for her age. (Joey makes the international sign for big boobies.)
(To Monica) A concept lost on some people!
Monica  So its okay to date a student.
Ross  Well, not really. I mean technically its-its not against the
rules or anything, but it is frowned upon. Especially by that professor we ran into last
night, Judgey von Holierthanthou.
Monica  Well Ross, you be careful now. You dont want to get a reputation
as yknow Professor McNailshisstudents.
Ross  Yeah. What-what should I do?
Joey  Well Ross, it seems pretty clear. I mean whats more important? What
people think or how you feel, huh? Ross, you gotta follow your heart.
Monica  Joey that is so sweet.
Chandler  (entering) Hey.
Joey  Hey-hey-hey! So, how did it go with Dana? Any reason I should leave a
block of time open say Thursday?
Chandler  I couldnt do it.
Joey  You couldnt do it?!
Chandler  Hey, relax I just need more time. Were going to dinner tonight.
Monica  What?! Youre going out with her again!
Ross  Going out with who?
Chandler  Uh, Dana Keystone from college.
Ross  Oh yeah! Wasnt she uh (Does the international sign for big
boobies.)
Chandler  No, that was Dana Caplin.
The Guys 
Monica  Joey! You didnt even know her!
Joey  Ah whatever!
[Scene  A Restaurant, Chandler is having dinner with Dana.]
Chandler  Great story again! The yarns that you weave! Woo-hoo-hoo!
Dana  Yknow uh, actually I-I-I should get going.
Chandler  Oh no-no-no! Stay! Stay! Because you-you should you-you-you should
stay!
Dana  Wow. Oh, I am really flattered, but I just I dont feel that way
about you.
Chandler  Oh no-no-no, thats notNo-no-no!
Dana  Im sorry Chandler, yknow you are such a sweet guy and I, I
dont want to hurt you. Oh, I wish there was something I can do to make you feel
better.
Chandler  No-noReally?!
Dana  Of course!
Chandler  (breaking up) Well, it just hurts so bad. I uh
Dana  Ohh, Im sorry.
Chandler  Well maybe there is one thing you can do.
Dana  What?! Anything! Anything!
Chandler  Well, I umm, I mean this is just off the top of my head now, umm but I
have this friend. This actor friend and he would kill me if he thought I was doing this
umm, but umm would it be possible for him to get an audition for your movie say on
Thursday?
Dana  Absolutely! But you-you would really feel better about me rejecting you if
your actor friend can audition for my movie?
Chandler  Well, the heart wants what it wants. Ill see you later. (He runs
off and leaves her with the bill, which the waiter promptly delivers.)
[Scene  Hotel Monica, Phoebe is on the bed playing her guitar as Monica enters.]
Monica  Hey! Hows it goin?
Phoebe  Well, not much has changed in the last five minutes.
Monica  Yes it has! I made cookies!
Phoebe  Oh thats all right. Im still full from your homemade potato
chips.
Monica  But you should eat them now because theyre hot from the oven.
Phoebe  Okay. (Reaches for one.)
Monica  (pulling the plate back) Oh-ho! But not in here! Cant eat em
in bed, remember? No crumbies!
Phoebe  (gritting her teeth) Okay, Ill be out in a second.
Monica  Okay!
Monica  (opening the door) What are you doing?
Phoebe  That doesnt lock does it?
[Scene  Joey's apartment, Joey and Rachel are eating spaghetti in the living room while
watching TV and Rachel drops some on the floor.]
Rachel  Oh, Joey! Sorry!
Joey  No thats all right. Dont worry about it.
Rachel  Oh but look! Thats gonna leave a stain!
Joey  Rach! Hey! Its fine! Youre at Joeys!
Rachel  Really?
Joey  Yeah! Look! (He throws some of his spaghetti on the floor.)
Rachel  Ive never lived like this before.
Joey  I know.
Joey  All right, dont waste it, I mean its still food. (He picks it up and
eats it.)
[Scene  Central Perk, Ross and Elizabeth are deciding what to do on their second date.]
Ross  What do you want to do now? Huh? You wanna go get a drink?
Elizabeth  Uhh, I cant.
Ross  Oh, you have some studying to do?
Elizabeth  No, I have some turning 21 to do.
Ross  Yknow I remember when uh, when I was in college, we used to
(He sees some of his colleagues enter and puts his head on her lap.)
Elizabeth  What are you doing?
Ross  Nothing, Im-Im just, Im so comfortable with you!
Elizabeth  Do you not want to be seen with me?
Ross  What? No! Of course, of course I do! Are-are they gone?
Elizabeth  Uh no, theyre still here but I think Im about to leave.
Ross  What?! No! No! Wait! Youre right, this is stupid. Who cares what
people think? I mean, I mean we like each other right? Theres nothing wrong with
that. Come on. (They get up and go over to the table where his colleagues are sitting.)
Burt? Lydia? Mel? This is Elizabeth.
Elizabeth  Hi!
Lydia  Arent you in my Popular Culture class?
Ross  Thats right Lydia, Elizabeth here is a student and uh, were
dating. And you may frown upon that, but were not gonna hide it anymore.
Mel  You are so fired.
Ross  What?
Burt  Theyre gonna fire you! You cant date a student! Its
against the rules.
Ross  Really? Its not just frowned upon?
[Scene  Joey's apartment, Joey and Rachel are throwing huge spitballs at the
entertainment center.]
Rachel  I love it at Joeys!
Joey  Hey, here you go. (Hands her another one.)
Chandler  (entering, sees Rachels throw) Ni-hi-ice!
Rachel  Thanks!
Chandler  (To Joey) So, you busy Thursday?
Joey  Oh, very funny. I dont know if you remember, but my audition was
supposed to be Thursday. (Chandler doesnt say anything until Joey figures it out.)
You got me the audition?! Lets hug it up! (They hug.)
Chandler  Okay. Okay. (Joey puts him down.) What are you gonna do to me if you
get the part?
Phoebe  (entering) Hey! Hi!
Rachel  Hi!
Phoebe  (To Rachel) Listen umm, yeah okay, I need to talk to you!
Rachel  Uh-huh.
Phoebe  Now I know that they said that the umm, the hair straightener started
the fire but I think Im partly at fault. You see, I didnt, I didnt tell
you but umm, but I-I had recently refilled the tissues and so yknow lets just
face it, thats just kindling! So I think its better that I stay at
Joeys.
Rachel  No, no-no-no. Phoebe, this was my fault and besides yknow what?
Im fine here.
Phoebe  Okay. Oh umm, Chandler, Monica is looking for you.
Chandler  Really?
Phoebe  Yeah she said something about crumbies.
Chandler  No! No! No! I was so careful! (Runs out.)
Phoebe  (To Rachel) Okay, you have to switch with me! Monica is driving me
crazy!
Joey  Thats right, all the ladies want to stay at Joeys.
Rachel  No! No! Phoebe, come on! I dont want to switch! Please come on! I
can throw wet paper towels here!
Phoebe  No but at Monicas you can eat cookies over the sink!
Rachel  I know. Im sorry.
Phoebe  All right fine! This looks like so much fun. (Examining the bowl of wet
paper towels.)
Joey  Yeah.
Phoebe  God, what a mess. (She grabs the bowl and heads for Monicas.)
[Scene  Ross's apartment, Ross is looking at his handbook. Elizabeth is also there.]
Ross  Wow! It actually is in the handbook. I cant date you or have a hot
plate in my office. I cant believe we have to stop seeing each other.
Elizabeth  For what its worth I did appreciate you standing up for me. It
felt really nice. It kinda made me like you even more.
Ross  I know, I know I really like you too. But we-we cant date. Its
against the rules. Its forbidden.
Elizabeth  Wow!
Ross  What?
Elizabeth  Just hearing you describe it as forbidden, its really hot.
Ross  Really?
Elizabeth  Yeah.
Ross  Well I-I-I dont care how hot it is its-its uh, its
wrong.
Elizabeth  Stop it! (She starts to get all worked up.)
Ross  (feeling it too) No! No! Its wrong! Its-its-its
naughty. Its taboo.
Elizabeth  Shut the book!
Ross  Lets also get a hot plate!
[Scene  Joey's apartment, Joey is eating pizza as Chandler enters.]
Chandler  Hey!
Joey  Hey!
Chandler  So?!
Joey  So?
Chandler  Its Thursday! How was the audition?!
Joey  Wh? Monday, one day. Tuesday, two day. Wednesday, when huh what?
Thurs(He gasps in horror.) Oh! (Runs out and Chandler just shakes his head. After a
second Joey runs back in to grab a piece of pizza and runs back out.)

[Scene  Joey and now Rachel's apartment, Joey has the fridge pulled out away from the
wall and is in the process of pulling off the cooling grate behind it.]
Joey  Well that thing is clearing in the way! All right. Ah-ha! (He grabs a
screwdriver and starts to attack the compressor, only he causes a small short circuit and
shocks himself.) Ah-ah!! Damn fridge!
Rachel  Hi Joey, how ya doin?
Joey  Great! Roomie!
Rachel  Huh, yeah I guess we are roommates now.
Joey  Yeah! Well, now that you brought it up, our fridge is broken. We have to
get a new one. Now, I checked around and your half is $400. Thanks a lot.
Rachel  Im not paying for half of that! Im only staying here until
my apartment gets fixed.
Joey  Look Rach, my parents bought this fridge just after I was born, okay? Now,
I have never had a problem with it. Then you show up and it breaks! What does that
tell ya?
Rachel  That refrigerators dont live as long as people.
Joey  All right, now you know that the ATM will only lets you take out 300 at a
time, Ill take a check for the other hundred.
Rachel  Youre jokin right?
Joey  Of course Im jokin! I dont take checks.
Rachel  Thank God youre pretty. (Exits.)
[Scene  Central Perk, Joey, Chandler, Monica, and Phoebe are there as Rachel enters.]
Rachel  Hey!
All  Hi! Hey!
Rachel  Do you guys know any cute guys?
Chandler  Well, of course I do! My good friend Joey over here. (Pats Joeys
arm, Joey pats Chandlers shoulder, and Chandler motions for Joey to say the same
about him.)
Joey  Oh, Im sorry. Thank you Chandler.
Rachel  Anyway, theres this big charity ball this weekend and Ralph Lauren
bought a table, so I kinda have to go
Monica  Whats the charity?
Rachel  I dont know, something either trees or diseaseRalph mumbles
a lot.
Monica  Does Ralph mumble when youre not paying attention?
Rachel  Yeah! Its weird. But the thing is need to find a date.
Phoebe  Well, what kind of guy are you looking for?
Rachel  Well, someone that has his own tux, or has the ability to rent a
tux.
Chandler  So he has to be a male who has at least $50.
Joey  Ooh! So close.
Ross  Hey everybody!
All  Hi!
Ross  Hey uh, this is Elizabeth.
Elizabeth  Oh hi!
All  Hi!
Elizabeth  Im the student.
Chandler  (laughs) Isnt she cute? (On Monicas death stare) No!
Phoebe  Yknow, this is probably none of my business, but werent you
guys supposed to not be seen in public together?
Elizabeth  Oh, were not together.
Ross  Oh no-no-no, were just two people who happen to run into each other
here at the coffee house. (He winks at her.)
Phoebe  Oh, sly.
Elizabeth  Well, I really wanted to meet you guys, but I have to run. Ill
see you later?
All  Okay!
Elizabeth  Bye Ross.
Ross  Bye.
Elizabeth  Oops! I did not mean to run into you like that sir.
Ross  Oh that is quite all right maam. (Elizabeth exits.)
Chandler  So, why is she leaving? Is it a school night and she has a lot of
homework to do?
Ross  Yes, her molecular epidemiology paper is due tomorrow.
Chandler  Oh, tell her good luck with that.
Ross  Anyone else? Huh? Bring em on!
Rachel  Oo! Whens her birthday?!
Ross  I dont know Rachel, why?
Rachel  Well, yknow its just been so long since Ive been to Chuckie
Cheese.
Monica  Oh, I like Elizabeth.
Ross  Well thanks!
Monica  Yeah. In fact, I like her so much you tell her I want my cookies early
this year! Yknow, a box of Thin Mints and some Tag-a-Longs.
Joey  Hey-hey come on you guys, give him a break. Ross, seriously, hows it
going with her?
Ross  Well, actually its been great. Shes 20 so shes not
looking for anything too serious, which is perfect for me right now.
Monica  Well that is great. And seriously, she seems very nice.
Ross  Thanks. I know you guys like to give me a hard time and all, but it really
means a lot to me that you like her. Just knowing that you guys are
Phoebe  (interrupting) Okay, I got a good one. Okay, umm, what is she? Like 12?
[Scene  Monica, Chandler, and Phoebe's, Chandler is sitting at the table and Monica is
doing something in the kitchen.]
Monica  Chandler, do you think we talk about our relationship enough?
Chandler  Yeah. Do we have any Fruit Roll-Ups?
Phoebe  (entering) Hey!
Monica  Hey!
Phoebe  Okay, I just thought of the perfect guy for Rachel to take to her thing.
Chandler  Oh thats so funny because we found someone too.
Phoebe  Oh thats good, I guess shell have a choice between my guy
and your weirdo.
Chandler  Why would our guy be a weirdo?
Phoebe  Cause thats just your taste.
Monica  (laughs sarcastically) Rachel is not going to pick your stupid guy.
Phoebe  Oh yeah?
Monica  Yeah!
Phoebe  My guy is a lawyer who has volunteer work. And, he has one of these (She
squeezes the skin on her chin together to form)
Chandler  A face ass?
Phoebe  A chin dimple!
Monica  Well, uh yknow, our guy works with Chandler and hes really
nice and smart and hes a great dresser!
Phoebe  Have you seen your guys body?
Chandler  No, our guy is just a floating head.
Phoebe  Well my guy is spectacular. Okay? Hes a massage client and one
time umm, when he was on the table, I looked at it. And I mean all of it.
Monica  Youre not supposed to look!
Phoebe  Oh yeah, like there are police for that!
Chandler  (horrified) Wait! You look? You-you massaged me.
Phoebe  I know. (Laughs.)
Monica  All right fine, your guy may have a great body, but our guy is really
funny.
Phoebe  Oh, Chandler funny?
Monica  Our guys a great dancer!
Phoebe  My guy is well read.
Chandler  Our guy has great hair.
Phoebe  My guy has great teeth!
Chandler  Our guy smells incredible.
Monica  (To Chandler) Do you want our guy to be your guy?
[Scene  Joey and Rachel's apartment, Chandler is entering to find Joey bingeing on the
food from the fridge. Joey isnt doing all that well.]
Chandler  Hey.
Joey  Huh.
Chandler  Well, youdont look good Joe.
Joey  The fridge broke. I have to eat everything. Cold cuts, ice cream,
limesHey, what was in that brown jar?
Chandler  Thats still in there?!
Joey  Not anymore. So anyway, how do you want to pay me?
Chandler  Is this a service youre providing me?
Joey  No! No! No! For my new fridgeour new fridge!
Chandler  Our new fridge? I dont live here anymore.
Joey  So what? Look, suppose we were a divorced couple.
Chandler  Uh-huh.
Joey  And I got custody of the kid, right? Now suppose the kid dies and-and I
gotta buy a new kid.
Chandler  (not quite sure where Joeys going and is a little worried)
Okay
Joey  (pause) Give me $400!
[Scene  Rosss office, hes unlocking his office door as Elizabeth walks up.]
Elizabeth  Professor Geller?
Ross  Hmm? (Turns around and sees that its Elizabeth) Oh, a student I dont
know.
Elizabeth  I was wondering if I could talk to you for a moment?
Ross  Yes, yes of course, what-what would this be regarding?
Elizabeth  Making out in your office.
Ross  Shh! (Laughs then composes himself) Of course, why dont we go
inside?
Ross  Oh-ooh!
Elizabeth  What?
Ross  Doorknob! Doorknob!
Elizabeth  Oh! Sorry! Umm, I actually do need to talk to you.
Ross  Oh, okay. What-what about?
Elizabeth  Spring vacation.
Ross  Spring vacation.
Elizabeth  Yeah, we have time off and a lot of people are going on trips
Professor Feesen  Professor Geller!
Ross  (quickly jumping away from Elizabeth) Yes, professor
Feesen-sen-stenlger Ill be with you in one moment. (To Elizabeth) So, I will
take one box of the Thin Mints. (And he ushers Elizabeth out of the office.)
[Scene  Joey and Rachel's apartment, Ross, Chandler, and Joey are entering.]
Ross  You dont understand! Elizabeth was about to ask me to go on a trip
with her! Is that taking it slow?! No, Im not ready for this! Okay? What-what do I
tell her?
Chandler  Just tell her the truth! Tell her youre not ready.
Ross  I can do that. Oh-oh, what if she gets upset?
Chandler  Then you distract her with a Barbie doll.
Joey  Or! You can just, yknow (He walks up close to whisper in
Rosss ear and when he gets there he pushes Ross into the fridge.)
Ross  What the hell are you doing?
Joey  What? What the hell am I doing? You just broke my fridge!
Ross  What?! What? How do you, how do you even know its broken?!
Joey  Oh-ho-ho, you think I dont know what breaks my fridge? Excuse me!
(He opens the door and feels inside.) Well what do you know! Broken! Thatll be $400!
Chandler  Joey, I saw you push him!
Joey  (pause) You pushed him!
Ross  Joey, I did not break this! Okay? (He opens the freezer and smells inside
and recoils in disgust.) That has been broken for a while.
Joey  All right. Chandler, do you remember how I told you about our fridge?
Chandler  Uh-huh.
Joey  I still havent gotten a check for your half yet.
Ross  Do not give him any money!
Joey  Im not talking to you! You broke my fridge!
[Scene  Rosss office, hes opening the door to Elizabeth.]
Elizabeth  You wanted to see me Professor Geller?
Ross  Yes. Yes! Please, come in.
Ross  Oo-oo!
Elizabeth  Doorknob?
Ross  Yeah, it kinda grows on you. (They both laugh.) Actually, I wanted to
finish talking to you about uh, spring vacation.
Elizabeth  Oh good.
Ross  Look, I (He has trouble sitting in his chair.) Look, Im having
a great time with you and I just dont want us to move to fast or put to much
pressure on us. So, Im sorry I just dont think we should go away together yet.
Its-its too soon.
Elizabeth  Ross, I think you misunderstood what I was saying. I just wanted to
tell you that Im going to Florida for a couple weeks.
Ross  No. I think you misunderstood what I was saying. What I meant
was
Elizabeth  You are so adorable.
Ross  That! Lets talk about that.
[Scene  Central Perk, Monica, Chandler, and Phoebe are there as Ross enters.]
Ross  Hey!
Chandler  Hey!
Phoebe  Hey!
Monica  Hey! How did it go with Elizabeth?
Ross  Huh? Oh-oh, it was fine. Uh, it was just a misunderstanding. She
didnt want me to go with her. She just wanted to let me know that shes going
to Florida for spring vacation.
Chandler  Wait a minute, is she going for spring vacation or is she going for
spring break? (Does a little whooping/party noise.)
Ross  Whats-whats the difference?
Monica  Well, spring vacation is doing nice things with your grandparents.
Spring break youre doing frat guys.
Ross  Hey, yknow what? Not all spring breaks are like that.
Phoebe  What did you do on yours?
Ross  I went to Egypt with my dad.
Chandler  I can see it now, "Look dad, its the Sphinx!" (Does
that party noise again.)
Ross  Hey, I think Elizabeth is a little more serious than, "Spring
break!" (Imitates the party noise.) All right? I mean shes taken my class!
Monica  And slept with the professor.
Ross  Im gonna call her.
Chandler  Yeah.
Rachel  Hey! You guys umm, I want you to meet Sebastian.
Sebastian  Hi.
Rachel  We just uh, we just met at the newsstand. We both grabbed for the last Field
& Stream. (Chandlers shocked.) What? I read that.
Sebastian  Can I get you a cup of coffee?
Rachel  Oh yes! Thank you! (He does so and Rachel sits down on the couch.)
Phoebe  Rachel, what the hell is this?!
Rachel  (shocked) What?
Phoebe  You ask us to find you a guy and you come traipsing in here with your
own!
Rachel  You found me a guy?
Monica  Yes! We found you a really cute and funny guy from Chandlers work!
Phoebe  Yeah and I-I found you one too who is not a weirdo.
Rachel  Well, yknow what though you guys? I really appreciate that but I
think Im just gonna take Sebastian to the charity.
Chandler  Are you sure?! Because our guy smells incredible!
Monica  Uh, would you stop it with that already?!
Sebastian  Here you go. (Hands her, her cup.)
Rachel  Oh, thank you.
Sebastian  Sure.
Phoebe  So, Sebastian, do you do any volunteer work?
Sebastian  Uh, no not really. Why?
Phoebe  No reason, its just I know a single guy that cares about other
people.
Chandler  Are you funny?
Sebastian  Excuse me?
Rachel  What are you guys doing?
Monica  Are you funny? Tell us a joke!
Sebastian  Look, I just wanted to have coffee with Rachel.
Phoebe  Well, so do a lot of people.
Sebastian  Actually, I uh, I gotta get going. (To Rachel) Give me a call
sometime.
Rachel  Oh, but yknow, no, you didnt give me your phone number.
Sebastian  Okay! See you later! (Exits.)
Chandler  (To Monica) Turns out he is kinda funny.
[Scene  Central Perk, continued from earlier.]
Rachel  I cannot believe you guys! He was really nice and he left because of
you!
Chandler  Yeah, but Sebastian? What is that? A cats name?
Phoebe  Yeah, yknow what I noticed Rachel? He scares easy. Is that the
kind of guy youd like to take to a ball? "Hey Sebastian, would you like to
dance?" (Imitates him.) "Uhh, okayI gotta go!"
Monica  All right guys stop it. Rachel, were very sorry that is a very
insensitive thing for us to do. And yknow what? Let us make it up to you, we have
two really great guys for you.
Phoebe  Yeah! What have you got to lose? Yknow you might even end up with
someone really special (whispers) if you pick my guy.
Rachel  All right.
Chandler  Okay, so you will meet our guys?
Rachel  Yes, Ill meet em.
Chandler  Okay now it doesnt matter which one you choose, yknow?
Its completely up to you. Our guy is perfect, or you can go out with the guy Phoebe
deemed not good enough to go out with herself.
Joey  (entering) Pheebs! There you are! Okay, you broke my fridge; you owe me
400 bucks!
Phoebe  Okay sure!
Joey  Really?!
Phoebe  Ooh, technically you owe me $600 for sending out happy thoughts on your
last ten auditions.
Joey  Call it even?
Phoebe  Okay.
Chandler  (To Ross) Well, there you are! So what did Elizabeth say?
Ross  Well, it turns out that she is going to Daytona for spring break woo-hoo.
That means, that means wet T-shirt contests, guys doing shots off of girls bodies,
waking up next to people you dont even know
Joey  Man, she is going to have a great time! Is she staying at the Hotel
Corona?
Chandler  You know the hotels?
Joey  Sure! I was there! Spring Break 81! Woo-hoo!
Monica  In 1981 you were 13!
Joey  So what? I drove down, sold T-shirts, had a blast. And yknow who
knows how to party? Drunk college chicks.
Ross  Okay, she cant go.
Phoebe  Ross, you cant tell her not to go. You just started dating.
Ross  Then what am I supposed to do?
Phoebe  Nothing, you just have to be cool with it.
Ross  Well, what is she goes down and-and sleeps with a bunch of guys?
Chandler  Well, maybe you dont marry this one.
[Scene  Elizabeths apartment, she is packing for her trip as Ross watches.]
Ross  Im so glad youre going on this trip!
Elizabeth  Yeah! Ive been working so hard this semester. I really need to
go crazy yknow, blow off some steam.
Ross  Sure. Sure. Look I dont, I dont know if your plans are
finalized yet, but umm, hey I-I know another great way to blow off steam.
Elizabeth  What?
Ross  Are you into crafts at all?
Elizabeth  Ross, are you okay?
Ross  Well, yeah, of-of course Im okay! What? Im just being
supportive. Supportive of you and this whole trip, and-and (notices something) what-what
is uh, whats this? (He holds up a rather skimpy bathing suit.)
Elizabeth  Its a bathing suit?
Ross  To wear in front of people?
Elizabeth  Is that supportive?
Ross  Is this?!
[Scene  Central Perk, Rachel is reading as Monica and Chandler enter.]
Monica  Hey!
Chandler  Good-good-good-good.
Monica  Hey!
Chandler  Hey!
Rachel  Hi!
Monica  Were really glad you decided to meet our guy.
Rachel  Oh
Monica  Youre gonna like him so much. So umm, when do you want to meet
him?
Rachel  I dont know. I know I dont work late tomorrow night.
Chandler  Tomorrow night is good. Tomorrow night is good, but uh, yknow
what? Why put off something till tomorrow that you can do right now? (Laughs) Eldad come
here! (He stands up from the next table.)
Rachel  What?
Monica  Eldad, this is Rachel.
Eldad  How are you?
Rachel  Well-well a little blind sided but yknow good.
Chandler  Eldad, sit down. (To Rachel) Move over! Move over now!
Rachel  IOhh! (Moves over and lets Eldad sit on the couch.)
Chandler  There you go! There you are! (Rachel stares at Monica and Chandler)
Monica  Okay! Okay! We can take a hint! (They start to leave but run into Phoebe
with her guy in tow.) (To Phoebe) What are you doing here?!
Phoebe  This is Patrick. (Points to him.)
Patrick  Hi.
Chandler  Hi. (To Phoebe) Okay, youre too late okay? Because shes
already with our guy.
Phoebe  (looks) Oh my God, youre right! I am too late; theyre
sitting on the couch and talking! (To Patrick) Come on! (They go over to the couch.)
Rachel?
Rachel  Yeah?
Phoebe  This is Patrick.
Rachel  Oh, hi.
Patrick  Hi.
Phoebe  Yeah, this is the guy I was telling you about.
Rachel  Yeah?
Phoebe  Yeah. And believe me, this suit does not do justice to whats
underneath it.
Rachel  Oh-okay, but Pheebs?
Phoebe  Yeah?
Rachel  Im just sort of in the middle of something.
Phoebe  Oh! Okay! Yeah, thats okay. (To Patrick) Have a seat. (Sits
Patrick down next to Rachel.)
Monica  No! You cant do that!
Eldad  Maybe I should go!
Monica  (stopping him) Sit down! Were winning!
Rachel  Okay, yknow what? Maybe I should go!
All  (Chandler stops her) No-no-no-no! Have a seat! Have a seat!
Monica  Rachel! Rachel! You havent touched Eldads hair!
Chandler  It is the softest hair! Touch it! (Both he and Monica do so.)
Rachel  Yeah, Im good.
Phoebe  Rachel? Patrick is really rich. (To Patrick) Give her some money.
Patrick  Yknow what Phoebe? This isnt really worth the free massage.
Monica  Thats right Patrick, bye-bye!
Chandler  (To Rachel) Eldad is much more cooperative! And he can dance! (To
Eldad) You dance for Rachel!
Rachel  No-no! Dont dance for me! Please? Dont! (She gets up to yell
at her friends.) What is the matter with you guys?
Phoebe  Yeah, okay, lets talk it out.
Rachel  I Am I the only one that this is embarrassing for?
Eldad  Im a little embarrassed. (Chandler shushes him.)
Rachel  Ill tell ya who should be embarrassed! Its you guys! Come
on! This is ridiculous! Thank you very much, but I do not need you to get me a date!
Phoebe  Then why did she ask us to
Rachel  I am still talking!! And then you chase away the one guy that I actually
liked! I mean, no offense to you guys. Really! I mean (To Patrick) congratulations on all
the cash, (He nods) and-and yknow(Feels Eldads hair)Wow! You do
have very soft hair! But I would much rather go to the ball all by myself than go through
anymore of this! Good-bye! (Grabs her stuff, starts to leave, then turns back suddenly,
and to Eldad) Now do you use some sort of special conditioner on that hair?!
Eldad  Yes, Papaya Extract.
Rachel  Thank you! (Storms out.)
[Scene  The airport, Elizabeths flight is about to leave and Ross is there to
send her off.]
Ross  So uh, have a great time down there.
Elizabeth  I will.
Ross  Yeah. And did you, did you pack that bathing suit?
Elizabeth  Yeah.
Ross  It was pretty funny when I, when I hid it for a while, huh? Anyway, umm,
I-I am worried about that bathing suit, not because its revealing which Im
fine with, no Im concerned about your health, sun exposure.
Elizabeth  Oh, dont worry I have plenty of sun block, its SPF-30.
Ross  Well, if whats in the bottle is actually 30. I mean sometimes you
get 30, sometimes its-its get 4, and I swear to God more often than not
its just milk.
Elizabeth  Ross, its going to be okay. Im not going down there to
hook up with a bunch of guys. I really like you. I like how things are going between us.
Ross  Really?
Elizabeth  Yeah! Im just going down there to relax and hang out with my
friends.
Ross  Okay. Cool.
Elizabeth  Oh hey! Here they are!
Guy  Elizabeth!
Ross  Call me!
[Scene  Monica, Chandler, and Phoebe's, Rachel, Chandler, and Phoebe are there.]
Phoebe  Rachel, were sorry for pushing those guys on you.
Rachel  Oh thats all right! Yknow, I ended up having a really good
time. Yknow, the charity was a big success and they raised a lot of money and
awareness.
Chandler  So what was it for anyway?
Rachel  I wanna say a disease.
Joey  (entering) Hey!
All  Hey!
Joey  I just got this really weird message from Ross. He said turn on MTV.
Rachel  Huh. All right.
Phoebe  Oh my God, look! Thats Elizabeth!
Rachel  Oh-oh Professor Geller.
Joey  Ahh, to be 13 again.
Chandler  Yeah.

Phoebe is overacting her part.]
Joey  The reactors gonna blow in three seconds, were never gonna
make it!
Phoebe  Youve got to get out of here! Save yourself!
Joey  No! I wont leave you!
Phoebe  Dont worry about me, Im a robot! Im just a machine!!
Joey  No youre not! Not to me!
Phoebe  (she stops reading from the script) Oh my God.
Joey  What?
Phoebe  I am extremely talented!
Joey  Yeah, youre great! Okay, lets take it from
Phoebe  (interrupting) No, I mean I was really acting my ass off.
Joey  Yeah, I thought I was pretty good too.
Phoebe  Oh yeah, youre solid. Yeah, youre just no me.
Joey  Yknow what? I think thats enough for now. Yeah. I dont
want to be over rehearsed.
Phoebe  (tremendously overacting) Fine! Ill do it without you! (Joey gives
her thumbs up) I dont need you or anybody else! Im gonna make it on my own!
(Joey closes the door to his bedroom.) Youll see!! Youll all see!!
[Scene  Joey and Rachel's apartment, Joey is memorizing his lines. Chandler, Rachel,
and Phoebe are there as well.]
Chandler  (To Joey) So uh, whats this thing youre auditioning for?
Joey  Oh, its a new TV show. Yeah. Im up for the part of Mac
Macaveli or "Mac." Yeah, Im a detective and I solve crimes with the help
of my robot partner. Hes a, hes a Computerized Humanoid Electronically
Enhanced Secret Enforcer or-or "C.H.E.E.S.E."
Rachel  So Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E.
Joey  Thats the title! Yeah! Yknow they really lucked out that the
initials spell cheese.
Chandler  That is lucky.
Rachel  HuhWait so Joey if you get this, youre gonna be like the
star of your own TV show! I mean youll be like the Big Cheese! (To Phoebe) Or the
Big MacHey! You love those!
Joey  Well, dont get your hopes up, because probably not gonna happen.
Chandler  Now-now, why would you say that Joseph?
Joey  I mean come on you guys! My own TV show? I just dont know if
Im good enough.
Phoebe  I am.
Rachel  Joey, what are you talking about? Youre a terrific actor.
Joey  You really think so?
Rachel  Ugh, how can you even ask that question?!
[Scene  Monica and Rachel's, everyone is there to watch Joey's first scene as Dr. Drake
Remoray.]
Chandler   Whoa, she's pretty. (Mentioning the girl on TV)
Joey   Yeah, and oh she's really nice too. She taught me all about how to
work the cameras, and smell-the-fart acting.
Rachel   I'm sorry, what?
Monica   What?
Ross   Excuse me?
Joey   It's like, you got so many lines to learn so fast, that sometimes
you need a minute to remember your next one. So while you're thinkin' of it, you take this
big pause where you look all intense, you know, like this. (Does this intense look where
it looks like he's smelling a fart.)
Chandler   Oh, ok.
Joey  (there's a gunshot on TV) There's my scene, there's my scene. [Joey on
tv] "Mrs. Wallace, I'm Dr. Drake Ramoray, your sister's neurosurgeon.  I'm
afraid the situation is much worse than we expected. Your sister is suffering from
a..." (Does the smell-the-fart look.)
Joey  (on stage in an Austrian accent) Vell, Eva, ve've done some excellent vork

dance number.)
Monica   Yes.
Ross   So you gonna invite us all to the big opening?
Joey  All right well, Im outta here. Wish me luck.
Phoebe  (overacting with a song this time) (singing) Gooood luck! Gooood
luck! We all wish you good luuuuuuuuck!!!
Joey  Yeah, whatever. (Exits.)
[Scene  Central Perk, Chandler and Ross are playing chess and are both studying the
board intently.]
Ross  Its your turn.
Chandler  Oh, are we playing this?!
Joey  (entering, dejectedly) Hey.
Chandler  Hey! Howd the audition go?
Joey  Terrible! I messed up every line! I shouldnt even be
an actor!
Ross  Wait a minute, are you doing that thing where you pretend it didnt
go well but it really did go well?
Joey  Yeah, did I fool ya?
Ross  Totally!
Chandler  So it did go well.
Joey  Oh, it went amazingly well!
Ross  Great!
Chandler  Oh thats great!
Joey  Yeah-yeah, its down to me and two other guys.
Chandler  Oh my God!
Ross  Wow!
Joey  And I know both of them, theyre really good. One of them is the guy
from those allergy commercials whos always getting chased by those big flowers
Ross  Oh, I love that guy! (Laughs.)
Chandler  Oh-oh, what are you doing?
Ross  (stops laughing) What am I doing?
Joey  Im just so nervous! Yknow? The callback isnt until
tomorrow at five. I feel like my head is going to explode!
Chandler  Well, it is overdue.
Ross  Look, dont worry. Okay? Youre gonna be fine.
Joey  Theres just so much pressure. I mean no offense, but what you guys
do is very different. I dont know if youd understand.
Ross  Yeah, none of us have to deal with pressure at our jobs.
[Scene  Chandler's office. He's on the phone, agitated.]
Chandler  (on phone) Yes, Fran. I know what time it is, but I'm looking at the
WENUS and I'm not happy!
Monica   Alright, well I'm tearing the lettuce.
Interviewer   Uh-huh. Is it dirty?
Monica   Oh-oh, no no don't worry, I'm gonna wash it.
Interviewer   Don't, I like it dirty.
Monica   That's your call.
Interviewer   So, uh, what are you going to do next?
Monica   Well, I thought that I would cut up the tomatos.
Interviewer   Are they, uh, firm?
Monica   They'r alright.
Interviewer   You sure they haven't gone bad? You're sure they're not very,
very bad?
Monica   No really, they're OK.
Interviewer   You gonna slice them up real nice?
Monica   Actually, I was gonna do them jullienne.
Interviewer   Aaaahhhhhhh.
Monica   I'm outa here. [Monica leaves]
[Scene  Bloomingdales, Rachels new job.]
Rachel   (on the phone) Monica, Im quitting! I just helped an 81 year
old woman put on a thong and she didnt even buy it! (Pause) Im telling you
Im quitting! Thats it! Im talking to my boss right now! (Pause) Yes I
am! (Pause) Yes I am! Yes I am! Yes I am! Yes I am! Yes I am! Okay bye, call me when you
get this message. (Hangs up.)
Monica   Well, what happened?
Phoebe   Well, he came in for a massage and everything was fine until...
(The flashback shows Paulo lying face down on the massage table and slowly moving his
hands up Phoebe's legs and grabbing her butt.)
All   Ohhhhhh!
Ross   Oh my God!
Phoebe   And all of the sudden his hands weren't the problem anymore. (The
flashback shows Paulo rolling over and showing Phoebe his equipment.)
Monica   Was it...
Phoebe   Oh, Boy Scouts could've camped under it!
Ross  You ate my sandwich?
Dr. Leedbetter  It was a simple mistake. It could happen to anyone.
Ross  (getting upset) Oh-oh really?
Dr. Leedbetter  Now-now calm down. Come look in my office, some of it my still
be in the trash.
Ross  (jumping to his feet in anger) What?
Dr. Leedbetter  Well, it was quite large. I-I-I-I-I had to throw most of it
away.
Ross  You-you-you-you (trying to remain in control) threw my sandwich away!
Ross   (losing control, we hear him shout outside) MY SANDWICH?!!!
Ross  MY SANDWICH!!!!!! (Ross's scream scares a flight of pigeons away.)
Joey  I want this part so much! Yknow? If I dont get this part
Im never gonna eat Macaroni and Cheese again!No, I didnt say
that! Thats a lie.
[Scene  Joey and Rachel's apartment, Chandler is there talking to the chick and duck.]
Chandler  Oh come on guys, its not like I moved to Europe! I just moved
across the hall! And we would have you over all the time if it werent for
(struggles to get this out) Monicas allergies. (The duck quacks.) Youre right,
I could never lie to you. She hates you. (The phone rings.) Should I get that? (Laughs,
then answers the phone.) Hello? (Listens) Uh no, Joeys not here right now. Can I
take a message? (Listens) Yeah, okay so the audition has been moved from 500 to 2
Monica  (startled) Ahh! Arent you dressed yet?
Chandler  (looks down at his clothes) Am I naked again?!
Monica  Were supposed to meet my parents in 15 minutes.
Chandler  Yeah okay, I was just talking to the guys. Just look at them I mean,
is it okay if they come visit?
Monica  Wh?! What about my allergies?!
Chandler  Oh right, your allergies. (Monica leaves and to the chick and duck)
All her, she hates you. (Chandler leaves without finishing the message for Joey.)
[Scene  Joey and Rachel's apartment, Joey and Chandler are playing foosball and Joey
scores a goal.]
Joey  Yes!! Ha-ha!! All right! Hey! How cool would it be if you could watch like
a real life-sized version of this? Huh? I mean how crazy would that be?
Chandler  As crazy as soccer?
Chandler  You mean you didnt get it from this?
Joey  The allergy guy got the part! Thanks!
Chandler  Well, maybe we can fix it yknow? Maybe we can send him some-some
big-big flowers and scare him!
Joey  How could you do this to me Chandler?! This part couldve turned my
whole career around!
Chandler  I messed up. Okay? Im sorry, I really messed up.
Joey  Hey, you dont even live here anymore! What are you doing answering
my phone? I have my machine!
Chandler  Which I bought for ya. Taught ya how to use it. You thought it was a
copier. Look, if there was anything I could do, I would do it. Okay? But everybodys
allowed one mistake, right?
Chandler   You know he coulda gotten me a VCR, he coulda gotten me a set of
golf clubs, but no, he has to get me the woman repeller!  The eyesore from the
Liberace house of crap!
Phoebe   It's not that bad.
Chandler   Oh, yeah, easy for you to say, you don't have to walk around
sporting some reject from the Mr. T collection. [Joey walks in behind Chandler]
Phoebe   Chandler, Chandler.
Chandler   I pity the fool who puts on my jewelry, I do, I do. I pity the
fool that. . . [turns around and sees Joey] Hi!
Chandler   Yeah, I mean when you were late last night, Kathy and I got to
talking, and one thing to another and
Joey   And what?! Did you sleep with her?!
Chandler   No! No! No! I just kissed her.
Joey   What?!! Thats even worse!!
Chandler   How is that worse?!
Joey   I dont know! But its the same!
Chandler   Youre right, I have no excuses! I was totally over the
line.
Joey   Over the line?! You-youre-youre so far past the line,
that you-you cant even see the line! The line is a dot to you!
Chandler  Look, Im not saying that you should magically forgive me! But
youre not perfect! Youve made some errors in judgment too!
Joey  Name one!
Chandler  (lets him out) What happened?!!
Joey  (getting out) Awww, man! He promised he wouldnt take the chairs!!
Chandler   What the hell happened?!! How were you locked in?!! And where
the hell is all of our stuff?!!
Joey   Well, this guy came by to look at the unit and-and he said he
didnt think big enough to fit a grown man!
Chandler   So--You got in voluntarily?!
Joey   I was tryin to make a sale!! Oh, man, if I ever run into that
guy again, do you know what Im gonna do?
Chandler   BEND OVER?!!!
Chandler  Ok, now, remember, no trading. You get the pretty one, I get the mess.
Lorraine  Hi, Joey. (Sees Chandler.) Well well, look what you brought.
Chandler  ...And what did you bring?
Lorraine  She's checking the coats. Joey, I'm gonna go wash the cab
smell off my hands. Will you get me a white Zinfandel, and a glass of red for Janice.
Chandler  Janice?
Chandler  Janice?!
Janice  Oh.... my.... God.
Chandler  Joey's tailor...took advantage of me.
Ross  What?
Joey  No way!  I've been going to the guy for 12 years.
Chandler  Oh come on!  He said he was going to do my inseam, and he ran his
hand up my leg, and then, there was definite...
Ross  What?
Chandler  Cupping.
Joey  That's how they do pants!  Ross, will you tell him? Isn't that how
they measure pants?
Ross  Yes, yes it is. In prison!
Joey  I said name one!
[Scene  Monica, Chandler, and Phoebe's, Monica and Rachel are consoling Chandler.]
Chandler  I cant believe I did this! What an idiot!
Monica  Oh, stop beating yourself up! People make mistakes! These things happen!
There arent any message youve forgotten to give me are there? (Chandler has a
disgusted look on his face.) Apparently youre not very good at it! I
Chandler  Do you think hell ever forgive me?
Rachel  Of course he will! But Chandler the most important thing is you forgive
yourself!
Chandler  Yknow what? I-I kinda have.
Rachel  Already? Thats pretty bad what you did.
Monica  Yknow what? He will forgive you. And I like to bring a pad
with me when I go answer the phone just in case (Chandler gets that disgusted look
back.) Okay
Chandler  You didnt see how mad he was, yknow?
Rachel  Im sure he will forgive you. Look, we have all been there!
Yknow, you fight, you make up, its just the way it works.
Ross  It took two people to break up this relationship!!
Rachel  Yeah! You and that girl from that copy place, which yesterday you took
full responsibility for!!
Ross  I didnt know what I was taking full responsibility for! Okay?! I
didnt finish the whole letter!
Rachel  What?!!
Ross  I fell asleep!
Rachel  (mocking him) You fell asleep?!
Rachel  Y'know I cant believe I even thought about getting back
together again! We are so over!!
Ross  (starts to cry) FINE BY ME!! (he opens the door and traps Chandler behind
it)
Rachel  And hey! Just so you know, its not that common! It doesnt
happen to every guy! And it is a big deal!!
Chandler  (coming out from behind the door) I KNEW IT!!!!
Monica  You had no right to go out with him.
Rachel  That is the most ridiculous...
Monica  You sold me out.
Rachel  I did not sell you out.
Monica  Yes you did.  You absolutely sold me...
Rachel  Would you let me talk. [flicks Monica on the forehead]
Monica  Did you just flick me?
Rachel  OK, well, you wouldn't let me finish and I was jus- [Monica flicks her
back] Ow. That hurt [flicks Monica]
Phoebe  Oh!  All right.  Now, let's not do this!
Phoebe  Happy thoughts!  Happy thoughts!
Phoebe  OK, now I'm gonna kick some ass.
(Phoebe grabs each of them by an ear.)

Monica and Rachel  Ow! Ow! Ow!
Phoebe  I know!  I know!  I know!
Phoebe  Alright, now I will let go if you both stop.
Rachel  Fine!
Monica  Fine!
Phoebe  There we go.You know what, if we were in prison, you guys would be,
like, my bitches.
Joey  Okay, buddy-boy. Here it is. You hide my clothes, I'm wearing everything
you own.
Chandler  Oh my God! 
Joey  Look at me! I'm Chandler! Could I be wearing any more clothes?
Maybe if I wasn't going commando...
Joey  Yeah. Whew, it's hot with all of this stuff on. I ah, I better not do any,
I don't know, lunges. (starts doing lunges)
[Scene  Joey and Rachel's apartment, Chandler is entering with a peace offering of a
Joey Special, two pizzas.]
[Scene  Joey and Rachel's apartment, Joey is entering to find Chandler waiting
patiently for him.]
Joey  Hey!
Chandler  Please tell me you got the message!
Joey  What message?
Chandler  The actor playing Mac couldnt do it, they needed to see you at 2
oclock.
Joey  What?! Its 6 oclock!
Chandler  Du-du-I wrote it, I wrote it on the board! I wrote it on the board,
then I went all over New York City looking for ya! I went to Rosss! I went to the
coffeehouse! I went to any place that they made sandwiches!
Joey  I cant believe this Chandler!
Chandler  Sorry! I-I-I dont know what to say.
Joey  Well you-you-you-you might say congratulations! I saw the board! I went to
the audition! I got the part!!
Chandler  (angrily) Is that supposed to be funny! I was really worried over
here!
Joey  Oh, well Im uh
Chandler  Yknow, sometimes that fake out thing is just mean!
Joey  Oh wow! Okay man, Im sorry. I did not mean to make you feel bad.
Chandler  Well thats good. Because you didnt! And Im
incredibly happy for ya!!
Joey  (shocked) Thats mean! You really had me going there!
Chandler  Oh, we could do this all day.
Joey  Yeah, youre right. Okay look, listen, lets talk about what a
huge star Im gonna be!
Chandler  You are gonna be a huge star! Im gonna hug ya!
Joey  You hug me!
Chandler  All right!
Joey  Hey, do we do this too much?
Chandler  I think so. Yeah, get off me.
Joey  Yeah.
[Scene  Joey and Rachel's apartment, Joey and Phoebe are reading a scene from Mac and
C.H.E.E.S.E.]
Joey  Come on C.H.E.E.S.E., Im not leaving without you! Try routing your
backup source through your primary CPU.
Phoebe  (overacting badly) I cant! My circuits are fried! Theyre
fried I tell you!!
Joey  Wow! (Back to reading the scene.) Well then Ill just have to carry
you.
Ross  Thatll be a neat trick, when youre, (looks at the script) when
youre dead!
Joey  Ross, you dont have to yell.
Ross  There was just an explosion, okay? My hearing would be impaired.
Phoebe  I thought you were excellent! In fact for a minute there I was like,
"Ooh, whered Ross go?"
Ross  Thank you! And I have to say that first scene when you meet Mac
Phoebe  Yeah?
Ross  Oh my God. I mean
Joey  Yknow what? I think thats enough for today. Thanks for your
help! (He grabs their scripts and heads for his room.)
Phoebe  (To Ross) Hes holding us back.
Ross  Totally.

[Scene  Central Perk, Phoebe, Rachel, Chandler, and Monica are there. Rachel is reading
everyones horoscope.]
Rachel  Okay, Chandler!
Chandler  Okay.
Rachel  And your horoscope says, "On the fifth a special someone is going
to give you a gift."
Chandler  (To Monica) Oh, well thank you in advance. (Kisses her.)
Rachel  Op, but the twelfth brings a lovers spat.
Monica  (To Chandler) You are going to make a joke about my special
present! Why would you do that?!
Rachel  Oh, wait and on the nineteenth a secret crush announces itself.
Joey  (entering) Hey guys!
Chandler  Hey!!
Rachel  (ecstatic) Oh my God! Its Joey Tribbiani of Mac and
C.H.E.E.S.E.!!!!!!!
Chandler  Oh thats right. Its your first day! So are you psyched to
fight fake crime with your robot sidekick?
Joey  Am I psyched? The lead in my own TV series? Ive dreamed about this
for years! Why have I not been preparing?!
Phoebe  No! Joey, youre going to be great!
Joey  But I got to act with a robot Pheebs, and-and I dont know anything
about technology! I cant even use Chandlers computer except to find porn!
And-and thats only cause its right there when you turn it on!
Monica  I think our lovers spat will start a little early this month.
Phoebe  (in a sexy voice to Chandler) Ill be waiting.
[Scene  Central Perk, time lapse. Phoebe is now looking at the covers of two different
books.]
Chandler  Are you judging them by their covers? Because youre really not
supposed to do that.
Phoebe  No, Im just deciding which one to useIm gonna start
writing another book!
Rachel  Be-because the last one was such a big seller?
Phoebe  Well, if you must know I have written 14 books. And as I am the only one
who has read them, I can tell you that they all have been very well received.
Ross  (entering) Hey!
Chandler  Hey!
Rachel  Hey!
Ross  What are you guys doing later?
Phoebe  Oh, Rachel and I have appointments to get our hair cut.
Rachel  (To Phoebe) We do?
Phoebe  I want to see what he wants first.
Rachel  Okay.
Ross  (continuing) I just found out that Elizabeths dad wants to meet me.
Chandler  Wait a minute, hold the phone! Youre not Elizabeths dad?!
Ross  Come on guys, I-I really want this guy to like me. It-it would really help
me out if you guys were here to make me look good.
All  Of course well help! Yeah! Well be here!
Ross  Thanks!
Monica  We know how tough those parent/teacher conferences can be.
[Scene  Pier 59 Studios, its the set of Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E. The producer is
showing Joey around the set.]
The Producer  (walking into Macs office) So uh, heres your office
set!
Joey  Wow! Huh? (Picks up the phone) Mac Macaveli, Private Investigator!
The Producer  (checking his watch) Lets get you into wardrobe for a
fitting.
Joey  Okay. Hey uh, when do I get to meet the robot?
The Producer  Im sorry, why dont we do that right now? Hes
right here. (Points to a guy.)
Joey  Okay.
The Producer  Joey Tribbiani, this is
Joey  Oh wow! Hes so lifelike! (Starts touching the guys cheeks)
Unbelievable! (He starts tugging on the guys ears.
The Producer  This is Wayne, the man who created and operates C.H.E.E.S.E.
Joey  (slaps Wayne on his cheek) How do you do there, Wayne? (Backs away.)
The Producer  Ill let you two guys get acquainted, huh? (Walks away.)
Joey  Okay. Sorry about that(Mimics that cheek thing he just did.) Uh, so
wheres C.H.E.E.S.E.?
Wayne  C.H.E.E.S.E. is right here. (He puts on his headset, picks up the
controller, and wheels C.H.E.E.S.E. in. C.H.E.E.S.E. is just a plain old robot on tracks;
he kinda looks like No. 5 in the movie Short Circuit.)
C.H.E.E.S.E.  (Wayne with a computerized voice) Nice to meet you Mac!
Joey  (laughs) This is like the temporary robot, right?
Wayne  No. Why?
Joey  Well, I-I just, I just it was going to be like a really cool robot,
yknow? Like the terminator or uh, when I first saw you.
Wayne  I spent two years developing this machine, its absolutely state of
the art.
Joey  Im sorry, it justI dont know it doesnt really look
like it can do anything.
Wayne  It can do this. (He moves C.H.E.E.S.E.s arm close to Joeys
special area and he jumps back.)
[Scene  Central Perk, Ross is at the counter drinking coffee as Elizabeth enters with
her dad, Paul. Elizabeth goes to kiss Ross, but he just kisses her on the forehead. By the
way Paul is played by Bruce Willis. Yes, that Bruce Willis from Moonlighting, Die
Hard, and Armageddon.]
Elizabeth  This is my father, Paul Stevens. Dad, this is Ross Geller.
Ross  It-its great to meet you Paul.
Paul  I usually prefer Elizabeths boyfriends to address me as Mr. Stevens.
Ross  Of course, of course, Mr. Stevens.
Paul  So Ross, what your problem?
Ross  Eh-whExcuse me?
Paul  Why cant you get a girlfriend your own age?
Ross  Thats funny. Umm. (Pause, then serious) Its not funny.
Paul  I dont like you going out with my daughter Ross.
Ross  Okay. I can, I can see that. Umm, but I think if you give me umm, one
chance I can, I can change your mind.
Paul  Okay.
Ross  What?
Paul  Okay. Ill give you one chance to change my mind. (Ross laughs in
relief) You got one minute. (Ross suddenly gets worried.)
Elizabeth  Daddy!
Paul  Fine! Two minutes. Go.
Ross  This isyou(Ross starts laughing.)
Paul  (laughs then checking his watch) 1 minute 50 seconds.
Ross  Okay, umm I want you to know that I have never done anything like this
before. I mean, I mean Ive been in um, relationships in general, uh but I have never
done it with a studentI mean I notnot it! I mean, I mean I
dontWe havent done it. Uh, I mean, I mean,
weve-weve-weve done stuff. (Paul is not amused.) Okay, okay, a joke, a
jokelighten the mood. Umm, two guys go into a bar. One of them is Irish.
Paul  Im Irish.
Ross  And the Irish guy wins the joke!
Monica  Ross!!
Chandler  Ross!
Monica  How crazy that wed run into you!
Ross  Oh God, thank you! (Runs and gives all of them a group hug.) Umm, uh, Mr.
Stevens Id like you to meet my friends uh, this is Phoebe, Monica, and Chandler.
Phoebe  Youre Elizabeths father, huh? I can see now where she gets
her rugged handsomeness.
Monica  (obviously attracted to him) Is-is-is there a-a Mrs. Stevens?
Chandler  Theres a Mr. Bing!
Paul  No, unfortunately Lizzies mom passed away shortly after she was
born. I raised her by myself.
Phoebe and Monica 
Paul  I get that a lot.
Ross  Okay umm, why dont we all take a seat, yknow? And uh, and
Ill get us all some uh some coffees(He goes to pull out Elizabeths
chair, but Paul steps in)Yeah, why dont you. (Paul pulls out her chair) Uh and
you guys can talk about whatever, whatever you want. Yknow? Whatever pops into your
head. (He turns his back to Paul and Elizabeth and points to himself for Chandler, Monica,
and Phoebe. Then he goes to order the coffee.)
Monica  Yknow, it is so strange seeing Ross here this time of day,
cause usually hes got the childrens hospital.
Phoebe  Yeah. Not looking for dates. (Monica turns in horror.)
Elizabeth  So uh, Monica is Rosss sister.
Monica  And hes a great brother!
Paul  I had a sister.
Monica  Ohh!
Paul  She passed away.
Monica and Phoebe 
Paul  Oh, you dont have to do that every time.
Chandler  But uh Ross, Ross is a great guy! I was roommates with him in college.
Uh, funny story (He starts laughing then notices that Paul isnt happy.)
Youre roommate in college died didnt he?
Paul  A part of him did yes.
Ross  (returning with the coffee) Okay here we are Paul, Elizabeth. (He sets
down their cups.) So I hope you guys were finding something to talk about.
Chandler  Yes, we were just
Rachel  Hi, Im sorry Im late but I am ready, ready to talk you up!
When does Lizs father get here?
Paul  Im already here.
Rachel  Oh! Ross is sooo great!
[Scene  Monica, Chandler, and Phoebe's, Phoebe is working on her book at the kitchen
table, Monica is on the couch, and Chandler is entering from the bathroom carrying a
package of toilet paper.]
Chandler  Hey honey, you got the kind with the little girl, you said we were
gonna to get the kind with the baby.
Monica  No, you said the baby creeps you out.
Chandler  No, the little girl creeps me out.
Monica  You said the baby.
Chandler  Why would the baby creep me out?
Monica  Why would the little girl creep you out?
Phoebe  (writing frantically) You guys, Im sorry, could you please talk a
little slower?
Chandler  This is going in your book?
Phoebe  Yeah, its about relationships. Yknow? The traps, the
pitfalls, what not to do, keep going. This stuff is great!
Monica  What?! Excuse me!
Phoebe  And how none of it matters when the people really love each other.
(Chandler and Monica kiss.) And how people will believe anything you tell them as long as
its a compliment.
[Scene  Central Perk, Rachel is there alone as Paul enters.]
Rachel  (seeing him) Oh hi!
Paul  Hi! Hi. (Hes looking around.) I think I left my keys here somewhere.
Rachel  Oh! Well lets look for them. (Finds some under one of the couch
cushions. It has a pink, fuzzy ball on the key chain.) Oh-oh-hey! Are these them?
Paul  No.
Rachel  All right! (Throws them back under the cushion.)
Paul  Oh, here they are right here. (Picks them up from underneath the corner of
the couch.)
Rachel  Oh good.
Paul  Thanks for your help. (Starts to leave.)
Rachel  (chasing after him) Oh, wait! Sorry, Mr. Paul? Mr. Paul?
Paul  Just call me Paul.
Rachel  Paul. Umm, I just wanted you to know that Ross really is a great guy.
Paul  Well maybe you can date him then that would save me the trouble of killing
him. (Rachel laughs then starts looking at him.) Are you okay?
Rachel  You just dont look old enough to have a twenty-year-old daughter.
Paul  Well, we were very young when we had her.
Rachel  Oh. We?
Paul  Well yeah, it usually, it takes two people to (He taps his index
fingers together.)
Rachel  Oh no! Yes! Of course, I know that! I justI meant yknow are
you still a We or are you just You?
Paul  Im just me, my wife died shortly after Lizzie was born.
Rachel  (sympathetic) Ohh. So you raised her all on your own?
Paul  Yes I did.
Rachel  Ohh. (She touches his arm for support and likes what she feels) Ooh!
[Scene  Monica, Chandler, and Phoebe's, Phoebe is still writing in her book, Chandler
and Monica are in the kitchen as Joey enters.]
Joey  Hey!
Chandler  Hey!
Phoebe  Hey!
Monica  How was your first day?
Joey  Pretty great! Except I did get a little attitude from the robot.
Chandler  Damn those robots, theyre supposed to be our faithful
servants!
Joey  Anyway, it wasnt the robot, it was the guy who controls him. Yeah,
he doesnt like me. He had C.H.E.E.S.E. knock over the sandwich right when I was
reaching for one! Ohh!
Phoebe  Well, why dont you just get him fired?
Joey  I may have to, I hate to do it, but Im the star! Yknow?
Theres a limit to how many sandwiches I can eat off the floor. (His cell phone
rings) Excuse me. (Answers it, on phone) Joey Tribbiani.
Estelle  (on the other end) Joe! Im glad I found ya, I got an audition for
ya!
Joey  Wow!
Estelle  The thing is its kinda on the Q.T. The actor who has the part
doesnt know he might be fired. Its the lead in a series, Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E.
Joey  Im the lead in Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E.!!
Estelle  Uh-oh!
[Scene  Joey and Rachel's, Ross is entering looking for Joey, but instead he finds Paul
and Rachel making out on the couch.]
Ross  Joey?!
Paul  Hi Ross.
Rachel  I was just getting him to like you.
[Scene  Joey and Rachel's, scene is continued from earlier.]
Ross  Joey?! Joey!! (He runs into his bedroom.)
Rachel  Ross, Joey is not here.
Ross  Okay, Ill just wait for him in here!
Rachel  Ross, its okay. You can come out.
Paul  Yeah Ross its okay, its me, Mr. Stevens.
Ross  (coming out of the bedroom) Oh! Oh my God! I didnt even see you!
Paul  Sure you did! You came in, you got all awkward, and you ran into the
bedroom. You were shouting, "Joey! Joey!" Bye Rach. (Kisses her.)
Rachel  Bye!
Paul  Ill call you later. Bye Ross. (Leaves)
Ross  What-what-what thehow da-how did-what the-how did-what?!
Rachel  Well, yknow he lost his keys so he was looking for them
Ross  (incredulous) In your mouth?!
Rachel  No! Downstairs! And we got to talking yknow, for like two hours,
and I really liked him so I invited him up here for a cup of coffee.
Ross  You were at the coffeehouse!
Rachel  Ross, whats the big deal? So I kissed the guy!
Ross  He is my girlfriends father, okay? Its-its, its
weird!
Rachel  WhYou dated my sister!
Ross  That was different!
Rachel  What? Why?!
Ross  This is weird for me!
Rachel  Ross look, look this is good for you. Okay? Lets face it, so far
the guys not lovin ya! But I can turn that around! I got the inside track! We
can all go out to dinner, yknow? And I can talk you up! Ross, the guy is a very, very
successful lawyer!
Ross  How is that important?
Rachel  Oh its important!
[Scene  Monica, Chandler, and Phoebe's, Joey is telling everyone about his impending
termination at Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E.]
Joey  Apparently, theres like a million guys out there that can play Mac,
and theres only this one robot and this one guy who controls it! I didnt know
he could get me fired! What am I going to do?
Monica  Well yknow Joey, youre a pretty charming guy.
Joey  Thanks, but I kinda have a problem to deal with here.
Monica  No sweetie, youve got to win over the guy that controls
C.H.E.E.S.E.! Youve got to kiss some serious robot ass!
Joey  Thats not a bad idea. Yeah. Okay, but if I got to turn on the charm
tomorrow Im not wasting anymore of it over here with you guys. (Starts to leave, but
stops and turns to Phoebe.) Well, actually I got a little bit saved for you Pheebs.
(Exits.)
Chandler  So do you think uh, Joeys more charming than me?
Monica  Yeah! Thats why Im sleeping with him on the side.
Chandler  Yeah, you wish. (Stops to think about it and gets depressed.)
Phoebe  (writing in her book) "You wish."
Monica  Phoebe, stop writing about us!
Phoebe  Im not writing about you! Im writing about other people.
Chandler  Who?
Phoebe  Marcia and Chester.
Monica  Okay fine! Fine! Then you know what, Ill just write about Phyllis!
Hmm!
Chandler  Hmm.
Monica  (writing on a piece of paper) Phyllis is sitting in a chair.
Chandler  Oh.
Phoebe  I see what youre doing!
Monica  (still writing) Phyllis sees what Im doing.
Chandler  Oh-oh.
Phoebe  Ooh, I have tasted my own medicine and it is bitter!
[Scene  Pier 59 Studios, Joey is walking up to C.H.E.E.S.E. and Wayne.]
Joey  Morning! Hey, hows my favorite genius and my little robot buddy?!
(Pats C.H.E.E.S.E. on the head.)
Wayne  Dont touch him!
Joey  Okay! (He yanks his hand away.) All right. Umm, all right Wayne, level
with me. Okay? I-I keep hearing all these rumors that I might get fired. Okay, they even
have actors coming in to read for my part! Come on man, you-you got to give me a second
chance! I mean, I love-I love this little guy! (He grabs C.H.E.E.S.E.s arm and pulls
it off at the elbow.) Ah-ah!! (Wayne is shocked.) Okay, thats why you didnt
want me to touch him right? Here you go! Okay? (Hands Wayne the arm and he goes to fix it.
Meanwhile Joey starts to berate himself.) Stupid! I cant believe it! God! (A very
beautiful woman walks by.) (To her) Hey, how you doin? (He and her go over to talk
and Wayne looks on with envy.)
[Scene  A Restaurant, Ross and Rachel are on their double date. Rachel is busy talking
Ross up.]
Rachel  So it seemed that my prom date had stood me up, so Ross selflessly,
offered to take me.
Elizabeth  What a nice story!
Paul  So Ross was in college and decided to jump at the chance to take a young
girl to her high school prom.
Rachel  Wow! I definitely did not see that one backfiring! Im gonna
go to the bathroom.
Ross  Yeah, take your time.
Ross  (to Paul) Just-just so you know I was a freshman and she was a senior. So
it wasnt as bad as-as
Paul  Ross, look, I know Ive been giving you a lot of jabs and its
partly because Im very protective of Lizzie, and partly because well, they just keep
coming to me. But I have to admit that after all the wonderful things that Lizzie has told
me and the many, many, (pause) many stories that Rachel has told me that, well (pause)
youre not (pause) all bad.
Ross  Not all bad.
Paul  And anyhow, Im sorry I was so harsh before, but you have to
understand that I (pause) still look at Lizzie like shes a twelve-year-old girl.
Ross  Yeah. You know what? I know what you mean; I do that too.
Paul  I beg your pardon?
Ross  No! No! NotI dont mean I-I see her as a twelve-year-old girl!
I mean I-I have a son, whos umm six and I still think of him as a baby.
Paul  You have a son?
Ross  Yeah, well my-my ex-wife and I share custody of Ben and umm, uh, and just
so you know, Carol and I are on excellent terms as Im sure you are with your
wife! (Realizes) Oh, Im sorry! (To Elizabeth) Its unbelievable!
Paul  Dont worry about it, I just didnt realize you were married.
(Rachel returns and hears that.)
Rachel  Oh we were, but that was just a (pause as the audience reacts), I mean
that was just a big drunken mistake.
Ross  Youre back.
Paul  You two were married?!
Rachel  Oh! Whoops! Im sorry, you were talking about Emily!
[Scene  Monica, Chandler, and Phoebe's, Monica and Chandler are entering and
theyre arguing.]
Monica  Chandler, we said we would meet at the coffeehouse at six.
Chandler  We said seven!
Monica  We said six!
Chandler  The only way that I said six would be if the sevens, let meet at
seven, not at six.
Monica  Yeah and if I had seven, maybe I wouldve said something like this,
"Wow! My boyfriends such a wise assseven!"
Phoebe  (Turning around in the chair) Hi!
Chandler  Oh my good God.
Monica  Ugh!
Phoebe  I know what time you said.
Chandler  What?!
Phoebe  Well actually, I know what time Chester and Marcia said.
Monica  What time?
Phoebe  Quite an interesting turn of events, suddenly its my book to the
rescue, huh? (Reading her book) Ooh, very interesting. Yeah, well this certainly clears
things up.
Chandler  (disgusted) What does it say?!
Phoebe  I will tell you as soon as you thank me for writing my book.
Chandler  Thank you for writing your book. Its-its uh, great book and you are
the queen of everything.
Phoebe  Thanks! So are you.
Chandler  (To Monica) I told you I should not wear this color. (Hes
wearing a reddish-orange sweater.)
Phoebe  (reading from her book) Mon (Pause as she restarts) Marcia and
Chester are planning on seeing a movie on Sunday night. Marcia thinks theyre
supposed to meet at six, Chester thinks its at seven.
Chandler  So you knew we were gonna miss the movie!
Phoebe  Thats right.
Monica  Inside of telling us you decided to write in your stupid book!
Phoebe  (writing in her book) Marcia and Chester are mad at Phyllis.
[Scene  Joeys Dressing Room, Joey and Chandler are there.]
Joey  I cant believe Im going to lose this job!
Chandler  Oh Im so sorry man! Is there anything I can do?
Joey  Yeah! Help me get this mini-fridge past the security guard.
Wayne  Hey Joey, I want to talk to you.
Joey  Yeah? Well, I dont want to talk to you Wayne! I hate you! You ruined
my life! Oh, Chandler, Wayne. Wayne, Chandler. (They shake hands.)
Chandler  Hi, how are ya?
Wayne  Joey, Joey, I-I-Ill g-get you your job back if you help me out.
Joey  (incredulous) Why should I help you?!
Chandler  (whispering in Joeys ear) The reason he just said.
Joey  (happily) What do you need?
Wayne  I-I-I saw you on stage talking to that beautiful woman, yknow
Sarah?
Joey  Yeah?
Wayne  I wish I could talk to her.
Joey  What are you in love with her or something?
Wayne  Yeah. Her. All of them. Anyone.
Chandler  Yeah, Ive been there my friend.
Wayne  Listen, I-I guarantee you keep your job if you can teach me how to talk
to women like you do.
Joey  Oh wow Wayne, its not really something you can teach yknow?
Its pretty much something youre born with if you(Off Chandlers
look)You-you can teach it! Ill show you right how to do it.
[Scene  A Restaurant, Rachel is still trying to talk up Ross, not to much success.]
Rachel  I mean if you think about it, I mean Ross did learn something from each
marriage.
Paul  How to make the next one even shorter?
Rachel  Now wait a minute thats not fair. He was married to me a hell of a
lot longer than he was married to Emily, he just didnt tell me. (Everyone looks at
her, Ross not happily.) Maybe I have to pee again. (Gets up to try to use the bathroom.)
Paul  Well, this is fun. So Ross, did you kill any of these wives?
Ross  Yknow what? I-I-I I-I have had enough of this! Yknow,
I-I-I care a great deal about your daughter and I have treated her with nothing but
respect! So if-if youve got a problem with me, frankly
Paul  Are you yelling at me?!
Ross  God no!
Elizabeth  Yknow what daddy? If you dont like Ross, thats
fine. It doesnt matter to me, Im gonna go out with him anyway.
Paul  Really?! (She nods in the affirmative.)
Ross  Well if it doesnt matter to her, it doesnt matter to me! (to
Paul) Still not yelling!
Paul  Wow. What can I say? (Pause, pointing at Ross) This doesnt make me
like you any better!
Ross  Thats okay, Im not so crazy about myself right now either.
Paul  Then we agree?
Ross  Uh yeah, I guessYeah! I guess so.
Paul  Neither of us like Ross!
Elizabeth  I like Ross.
Ross  Ohhh! Kids!
Rachel  (returning) Wait-wait-wait, I just thought of another story about how
nice Ross is!
Ross  Thats okay Rach, were not liking Ross right now.
Rachel  Oh! Ive got a lot of those too!
[Scene  Macs Office, Mac is talking to C.H.E.E.S.E. about their case.]
Joey  Well, it turns out you were right C.H.E.E.S.E.
C.H.E.E.S.E.  The shipment never made it through Omaha?
Joey  You got it! And the rabbis beard, 100% horsehair. Nice catch
C.H.E.E.S.E.! (Pauses as he waits for C.H.E.E.S.E.s next line.) Its your line
C.H.E.E.S.E.! (Suddenly C.H.E.E.S.E. goes crazy and starts flinging its arms and
advancing on Joey behind the desk.) Wayne! Wayne!!

[Scene  Central Perk, Rachel, Chandler, Monica, and Joey are there as Phoebe enters.]
Phoebe  (dejected) Hi, you guys.
Chandler  Hey!
Monica  Hi!
Rachel  Whats the matter?
Phoebe  Well its justits one of those situations that I just
hate. Yknow? A massage client gave me three tickets to the Helmet-Pelts exhibit at
the Morgan Chase museum.
Joey  (nodding knowingly) Now youre thinking you gotta sleep with him.
Phoebe  No! No! Its just that he gave me three tickets and there are six
of us!
Chandler  Ill give up my ticket.
Joey  Me too.
Phoebe  Okay thats so generous!
Chandler  And I think Ross is generous too.
Phoebe  Great! Okay then its just us girls!
Monica and Rachel 
Phoebe  Yeah.
Rachel  So what-what is the exhibit.
Phoebe  Its mostly just photographs of lesbian love scenes interspersed
with video games and free sandwiches.
Joey  Oh man! (Hits Chandler)
Ross  (entering) Hey!
Rachel  Hi!
Chandler  Hey!
Joey  Hey Ross listen Chandler got you out of going to the lesbian sandwich
museum this weekend!
Ross  Thanks? But I have plans; Elizabeth and I are going out of town.
Monica  Oh thats great!
Ross  Yeah.
Monica  I mean think about all the money that youre gonna make!
Ross  Why? What?
Monica  Well, her father pays you for baby-sitting right?
Ross  No, no, thats funny. But maybe its time to move on, let it go,
yknow? Stop it! Besides, Rachel is going out with Elizabeths father, so ah,
hes much older than she is. Looks like Im not the only one interested in
fossils, huh?
Rachel  I mean Ross all that does is remind us that you are interested in
fossils.
Ross  Okay, okay. Uh, well uh, Rachel is going to need to yell sweet nothings
(Paul enters) in his ear.
Chandler  Ross.
Ross  Oh, come on you guys; thats funny! Yknow? Because hes
needhes got like a hearing aide yknow, cause-cause
yknow, cause hes all old, and
Paul  Okay look, Ross, just so you know that since Lizzie likes you so much,
Ive decided to accept the fact that youre going out with her.
Ross  Really? That okay, thats great.
Paul  Yeah. But then I changed my mind. Im funny like that. So I told
Lizzie, now Im telling you, I dont want you seeing my daughter anymore.
Ross  All right look, I-I realize it upsets you.
Paul  Yes it does.
Ross  But, Elizabeth and I are-are both adults and so I dont think
theres really anything you can do about it.
Paul  Ill call the university and tell them about your relationship and
have you fired.
Ross  Ohh! A man with a plan!
[Scene  A Dry Cleaners, Joey is there with Phoebe and is trying to get his picture put
back amongst the other celebrities hanging on the walls.]
Phoebe  Oh, this is so exciting! You get your picture back up on the wall of
fame! Eek!
Joey  I know. It was so cool when I was up there before. Me and Jim Belushi
would just be crackin up about something Then I get fired off of Days Of
Our Lives and he takes me down. Now hes just laughing at me. Look at him, that
smug Belushi bastard, Ill
Phoebe  (gasps) Ohh, okay maybe they put your picture back up they can put you
next to Matt Lauer. Look at him, smiling at me. (Giggles) Yeah I know; wed be great
together!
Joey  Hey! So Im back.
The Dry Cleaner  Who are you?
Joey  Joey Tribbiani! From the wall! (The dry cleaner doesnt remember)
Okay, maybe this will jog your memory, huh? (Holds his picture up in front of his face.)
Huh? Okay eh-ah-anyway, Im ready to go back up on the wall Im the star of a
new TV show.
The Dry Cleaner  (picking up a TV Guide) Show me in the table.
Joey  Oh well, its not on TV yet.
The Dry Cleaner  Well, then its not on the wall yet.
Joey  Okay, fine, I will bring you a tape, huh? (Walks away)
Phoebe  So umm, now do you have any of Matt Lauers clothes here? Maybe?
Just ones that havent been cleaned yet?
[Scene  The Morgan Chase Museum, the girls are entering.]
Monica  Oh, I love museums!
Rachel  Umm.
Monica  Soakin up all the culture.
Rachel  Yeah.
Monica  Where do you want to start?
Rachel  Ooh, the gift shop!
Monica  Yeah!
Phoebe  Hey, and then lunch.
Rachel  Oh, wait yes, but I cant eat too much. Paul is taking me out to
dinner tonight, he said he has a big surprise planned.
Phoebe  Oh wow. What, do you think maybe hes gonna tell you that hes
gay?
Rachel  What?! No! Why?!
Phoebe  No reason! That would just be a really big surprise, right?
The Museum Official  (to the couple) You can put the aisle over here (points),
and put the wedding ceremony right over here. (Points.)
Rachel  I didnt know you could get married here.
Monica  This would be a beautiful place to get married, yeah, but I
wouldnt put the aisle there and I would never have the ceremony there!
(Points to both places.) I mean youd have the ceremony under this big beautiful
arch. (The arch at the entrance to the room.)
The Museum Official  (To Monica) May I help you?
Rachel  Oh sorry didnt mean to interrupt. Its just such a beautiful
space; do you do a lot of weddings here?
The Museum Official  Yes. Were very popular. Theres a two-year
waiting list. Sorry! (She kinda storms out with the couple.)
Rachel  Monica, you should totally put your name down on the list
Monica  What?! Are you crazy?! Im not getting married! Im not even
engaged.
Phoebe  Yeah, but theres a two-year wait. And then what if you get engaged
in two years and then you got to wait another two years for this place. Thats
four years. Chandlers not gonna wait that long. Hes gonna find somebody else,
yknow? Someone, someone who did put their name on the list. (Rachel agrees.)
Rachel  Yeah hon, it cant hurt to put your name down! I mean in if two
years if youre not engaged you just dont use it.
Monica  Well, I mean I guess there is no harm in putting my name down.
Rachel  Im gonna do it too!
Phoebe  Me too!
Rachel  Really? Who would, who would you marry?
Phoebe  I dont know, I dont have anyone right now. Yknow?
Rachel  Oh Pheebs.
Phoebe  Dont feel too sorry for me. At least my boyfriend isnt gay.
Monica  Phoebe, that stuff is
Phoebe  Dont even get me started on yours!
[Scene  The Dry Cleaners, Joey is trying to get his picture up again.]
Joey  (entering) Hey! So, did you watch the tape of my show?
The Dry Cleaner  I did.
Joey  All right, lets get me back up there! (Holds out his picture.)
The Dry Cleaner  No! It dont go up on the wall!
Joey  WhatBut you saw the show!
The Dry Cleaner  Yes, it was very offensive to my people!
Joey  Dry cleaners?
The Dry Cleaner  Russians! It showed them as terrorists and villains!
Joey  Okay! Okay, look! You-you-you got Harrison Ford up there!
The Dry Cleaner  Thats right. Mr. Ford is a very good customer, he brings
us a lot of clothes; you bring us nothing!
Joey  Okay well that may be true. But, in-in okay, Air Force One the
Russians were terrorists! And evil! And plus he kills a bunch of them!
That-that-thats offensive to Russians.
The Dry Cleaner  Ive never seen it!
Joey  Oh you should, its great.
[Scene  A Cabin in the Woods, Elizabeth is giving Ross a tour.]
Ross  This place is really beautiful!
Elizabeth  Yeah, Ive been coming here since I was a kid. This used to be
my Grandmas.
Ross  Wow! The only thing I got from my Grandmother was her eyes. I mean not-not
her actual eyeballs, but, but people say that my eyesDo-do you want to make out?
Elizabeth  Sure!
Elizabeth  Are you okay? Whats wrong?
Ross  Ehh, I was just, I was just thinking about your father.
Elizabeth  Well, whatever works for ya
Ross  No. No-no uh, he just, he just really freaked me out before.
Elizabeth  Oh. Well, so we have to hide our relationship from one more person.
Big deal. Besides, its kinda fun hiding.
Ross  Yeah.
Elizabeth  (quietly) Hey umm, you brought protection right?
Ross  (loudly) Why?! Are there like bears or something?! (Looks around and then
sees that Elizabeth is shaking her head no and realizes what Elizabeth meant.) Ohh. Oh,
protection. Yeah-no, yeah-no, that-that-that I forgot.
Elizabeth  Ill just run to the store and get some.
Ross  Oh no! Hey-hey, Im the guy! Ill get it.
Elizabeth  Do you know where the store is?
Ross  No.
Elizabeth  Do you want to ride around town on my little pink bicycle?
Ross  A little bit.
Elizabeth  (laughs) Ill be back in ten minutes.
Ross  Okay.
Elizabeth  Why dont you get in the hot tub and Ill meet you there.
Ross  Ohh, okay.
Rachel  (from another room) Oh my God, what a great surprise! This is such a
beautiful house.
Paul  (To Rachel) Thank you, its my moms. So this is the kitchen.
[Scene  Monica, Chandler, and Phoebe's, Chandler is reading the newspaper as the phone
rings. He lets the machine answer it.]
Chandler  (on machine) Youve reached Monica and Chandlers, if
youre listening to this message, were probably screening. (to himself) Yeah we
are.
The Museum Official  (on phone) Hi, this is Heldi from the Morgan Chase museum.
Im calling for Monica Geller. I want to let her know that there was a cancellation
and if shes still interested in having the Bing-Geller wedding at our facility, it
is available (Chandler runs to answer the phone.)
Chandler  (on phone) This is Chandler Bing! This is Chandler Bing! (Listens)
Yes, the groomNo! Not the groom!!
[Scene  Pauls Cabin, Paul and Rachel are sitting on the couch drinking wine and
talking.]
Rachel  Its so secluded up here.
Paul  I know. I like it up here.
Rachel  I feel like were the only two people in the world. (She sets down
her wine class, picks up a walnut, and knocks another one on the floor.) Oops. Sorry. (She
reaches down to pick it up and Ross hands it to her. Ross is hiding under the couch and
causes Rachel to scream.)
Paul  Whats the matter honey? Did you see a little mouse?
Rachel  No-no! Big bear! Big bear outside! I think I-Iwould
youactually, would you go check on that?
Paul  Honey, we dont have any bears here.
Rachel  Well, okay. Would-would you get me a Diet Coke?
Paul  Okay. Ill be right back. (Gets up and heads for the kitchen.)
Rachel  Okay. (After Paul leaves Rachel drops to the floor to confront Ross.)
What?! What are you doing here?!
Ross  What are you doing here?!
Rachel  I came with Paul!
Ross  Yeah, I recognize the ankles!
Rachel  Get up!
Paul  (entering) Here you go honey! (Rachel kicks Ross back under the couch.)
Rachel  Ahh. Thank you!
Paul  Diet Coke. (Hands her the glass.)
Rachel  Op, ice. I need ice.
Paul  Okay.
Rachel  Thank you.
Paul  Ill be right back. (He goes to get the ice.)
Ross  (under the couch) You and your ice.
Rachel  Ugh! Get out! Get out! Go! Come on! (Ross gets up and heads for the
kitchen.) No! Not in there! Hes in there! (She points Ross to the door next to the
kitchen.)
Ross  (before entering) Did you really hear a bear?
Rachel  Go-go!
Paul  (entering) Here you go honey. One Diet Coke with ice.
Rachel  Ohh, thank you.
Paul  Im so happy that youre here.
Elizabeth  (entering) Here I am!
Paul  (jumping up) Elizabeth! Oh look, Elizabeths here! Who are you
talking to?
Elizabeth  Uh, you guys?
Paul  How did you know we were here?
Elizabeth  Umm
Rachel  Well, she-she ob-obviously saw the tire tracks that were leading up to
the closed garage.
Elizabeth  Obviously.
Paul  Elizabeth, what are you doing here?! (Motions that he brought Rachel here
to be alone with her.)
Rachel  Did-did you come up here to work on that term paper or something?
Elizabeth  Yeah! Yep.
Rachel  Well, why do yknow go in that room (points to the room Ross is in)
and do your homework?
Elizabeth  Ohh, I wouldnt do it in there. Thats my dads
bedroom.
Rachel  Thats your, thats your dads bedroom. (Yelling)
Thats your dads bedroom!
Paul  Why are you yelling?
Rachel  Whoa, that Diet Coke just went straight to my head! Woo!
[Scene  Monica, Chandler, and Phoebe's, Chandler is sitting at the kitchen table
staring at the phone as Monica enters.]
Monica  Hi, honey.
Chandler  (gets up) See you later. (Starts to leave.)
Monica  What? I-I bought groceries, I was gonna make you dinner!
Chandler  (angrily) Well next time ask! Or at least wait for me to ask! (He
storms out.)
The Museum Official  (on machine) Hi, this is Heldi from the Morgan Chase
museum. Im calling for Monica Geller.
Monica  Oh no!
The Museum Official  (on machine) I want to let her know that there was a

machine beeps off.)
Monica  NOOOO!!!!!!!!
[Scene  The Dry Cleaners, Joey has brought in a bunch of laundry in another
attempt to get his picture on the wall, but the dry cleaner isnt working right now.
Instead, a beautiful woman is working.]
Female Clerk  Can I help you?
Joey  Uh yeah, where-wheres the guy who decides whos pictures go up
on the wall?
Female Clerk  Hes not here right now.
Joey  Oh, youre kidding me! All-all right, well make sure you tell him
that Joey Tribbiani stopped by to drop off all of these clothes. Okay? Im an actor;
Im kinda getting my picture up there on the wall.
Female Clerk  Yknow, there are two people who could put your picture up
there. (She makes eyes at him.)
Joey  Oh really? Well, maybe you and I go out for drinks? (Pause) Youre
the other one right? (She thinks about it for a second and nods yes.)
[Scene  Pauls Cabin, continued from earlier.]
Paul  So Lizzie, are-are-are you planning on staying the night?
Elizabeth  Oh no-no believe me, Im leaving as soon as possible!
Paul  Good. Good. Not that we dont want you to stay, obviously youre
welcomeHow much more homework do you have?
Elizabeth  Ahh, I just have one problem left that I do not know how to
solve. Uhh, Rachel maybe you want to come upstairs and help me figure it out?
Rachel  Really? Okay. Okay, I-Ill go upstairs. (to Paul) If-if you get me
something from the car.
Paul  What do you need from the car?
Rachel  Surprise me.
Paul  (whispering) Okay. (Starts for the car.)
Rachel  (yelling) So youre gonna be in the car, I will be upstairs, and
thats where everybodys gonna be!
Paul  (standing in front of a mirror and to himself) Just relax. Just relax
Paul, youre doing great. (Ross moves a piece of luggage over so he can watch Paul.)
She likes you. She Maybe, she likes you. She likes you. Yknow why? Because
youre a (pause) neat guy. (Ross cant believe what hes hearing.) You are
the man. You are (pause) the man! (He opens his shirt and looks at his chest.) I still got
it. Nice and sexy. Youre just a love machine. (Starts singing) Im just a
love machine and I wont work for nobody but you! Hey bab-y! (Flexes and grunts
loudly.) Showtime. (Starts to leave and starts singing.) Im just a love machine,
yeah ba-by! (Grunts again and Ross is stunned.)
[Scene  Central Perk, Phoebe is there as Monica rushes in.]
Monica  Phoebe!
Phoebe  Yeah?
Monica  Have you seen Chandler?!
Phoebe  No! Why?
Monica  The woman from the museum called and said that there was a cancellation
and that we could move up our wedding and Chandler heard! (Phoebe gasps.) I know! How bad
is this?!
Phoebe  Well for the regular guy, its bad, but Chandler, Oh dear God!
Monica  I know! I know! And he totally freaked out and I cant find him
anywhere!
Phoebe  What are you gonna do?
Monica  Well, Im never gonna listen to you again, thats for sure!
(Mimicking her.) "Yknow, harm can it do if you go and put your name down?"
Phoebe  Rachel said that!
Monica  Well Rachels not here! (Runs out.)
[Scene  The Dry Cleaners, Joey and Phoebe are entering to see if his picture is
on the wall.]
Phoebe  Oh! Here it is! (Noticing it next to the door.) Ooh, Joey! Why did you
sign it, "Son of a bitch?" (Son of a bitch is written across the entire
picture.)
Joey  I didnt do that! Who wouldve done that?!
The Dry Cleaner  (entering) Son of a bitch!
Phoebe  Okay, maybe ask this guy.
The Dry Cleaner  You, get out of my shop!
Phoebe  Well, what did he do?
The Dry Cleaner  He went out with my wife!
Phoebe  Joey!
Joey  Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa, I-IHey! I did not go out with your wife!
(The same woman from before enters.) Okay? I went out with her! (Points at her.)
The Dry Cleaner  Thats my wife!!! Get out! (Starts yelling at him in
Russian, and Im betting hes not saying pleasant things about him.)
Phoebe  Well, we should go.
Joey  Yeah.
[Scene  Pauls Bedroom, Elizabeth is entering.]
Elizabeth  Ross? Ross?
Ross  Elizabeth! (He opens one of the bed stands that he has curled himself up
into.) Okay. Okay. (She helps him out.) Im gonna go out this window. (Points to the
window next to him.) Ill meet you at the front door. Just tell them youre
going home, okay?
Elizabeth  Okay!
Rachel  (yelling from the living room) Oh wait-wait-wait!! No! Dont go in
there! Dont go in there! I need another soda!
Paul  Ross!
Rachel  Oh my God Ross! What in heavens name are you doing here?
Ross  (to Elizabeth) And that is why we cannot see each other anymore.
Paul  Ross. You and I are going to have to have a little talk.
Elizabeth  Daddy!
Paul  Youre next!!
Elizabeth  Okay. I didnt know he was here. (Runs over to Rachel.)
Paul  Let me just see if I got this straight. I tell you to stay away from my
daughter or Ill have you fired. What you heard was, "Take my daughter, come up
to my country house, and ruin my weekend with Rachel!"
Ross  Okay, please-please Paul, just let me explain
Paul  No, let me explain! Fired!!
Ross  All right, fine! Fine! Have me fired! But uh, I want you to know that you
and I are not all that different. I mean, I too am a neat guy. (Paul just looks at him.)
Paul  (panicked) What?
Ross  And I too am just a love machine. (Hums a little bit and mimics
Pauls flexing.)
Paul  Ross, let me show you where the guest room is.
[Scene  Monica, Chandler, and Phoebe's, Monica is pacing, waiting for Chandler to
return. Chandler enters.]
Monica  (going over to him) Im so sorry. Please, stop freaking out.
Chandler  Im not freaking out. Why would I be freaking out? A woman named
Heldi called and said we were getting married, but that happens everyday. (Does one of
those Chandler noises.)
Monica  Honey, we were at this beautiful place, and I-I-I just put our names
down for fun! I mean, whats the harm in that?
Chandler  Right here! (Clucks like a chicken for some reason.)
Monica  Chandler, please dont think I was trying to pressure you. Phoebe
and Rachel
Chandler  Phoebe and Rachel! So the people that knew about our wedding before me
were you, Phoebe and Rachel, Heldi, and apparently some band called Starlight Magic 7 who
are available by the way!
Monica  It was a mistake. Please dont take this to mean anything, because
it doesnt.
Chandler  Okay.
Monica  Really?
Chandler  Yes, if it really doesnt mean anything, because you know that
Im just not ready
Monica  I know! I know.
Chandler  Okay. (They hug.)
Monica  Im gonna go tell Joey that (laughs) that youre back. I was
really worried about you. (Exits.)
Phoebe  (entering from her room) Hey, did she buy it?
Chandler  Totally.
Phoebe  So did Heldi show you the place?
Chandler  Yeah, its beautiful.
Phoebe  I cant believe youre gonna ask Monica to marry you!
Chandler  I know.
[Scene  Central Perk, Joey is going up to the counter.]
Joey  Hey Gunther.
Gunther  Hey! Take these cappuccinos to table 11 and that guy over there
(points) wants the biscotti.
Joey  Oh uh, well I just came in for a cup of coffee to go.
Gunther  Do you still work here?
Joey  No! No, I quit a long time ago. (Pause) Did I forget to you that one?
Im sorry.
Gunther  Oh thats cool, I was gonna fire you anyway.
Joey  Great! (Takes his coffee and leaves.)
[Scene  Monica, Chandler, and Phoebe's, Phoebe is at the sink and Chandler is looking
at a ring brochure.]
Chandler  Pheebs, can you help me pick out an engagement ring for Monica? I
cant figure this out! Its so hard! Should I get her a (turning to each page)
Tiffany cut or a Princess cut or aah-ah! Paper cut!
Phoebe  Now, have you told anyone else?
Chandler  No, I dont want to tell anybody else because I dont want
Monica to find out.
Phoebe  You told me.
Chandler  Well, its because I trust you, youre one of my best
friends, and you walked in on me when I was looking at ring brochures.
Phoebe  Yeah well, once again not knocking pays off. I only wish you hadnt
been on the toilet.
Chandler  Me too.
Joey  Hey. (Heads straight for the fridge.)
Chandler  Hey.
Phoebe  Hey! So Chandler, wanna go to the coffeehouse?
Chandler  Oh all right.
Phoebe  Yeah, coffeehouse.
Ross  Oh perfect, we were just gonna see if you wanted to go.
Chandler  Oh well, we dont because we gottheother pl-place.
Ross  How rude.
Joey  Oh, Im sorry. You wanna bite? (Holds his piece out for him.)
[Scene  Central Perk, Phoebe and Rachel are sitting on the couch.]
Phoebe  So how are things going with Paul?
Rachel  Good. Although yknow, he-hes a private guy. Yknow, I
wish I could get him to open up a little bit, share some feelings.
Phoebe  Thats easy! You just have to think of him as a-as a jar of pickles
that wont open.
Rachel  So what are you saying; I should run him under hot water and bang his
head against a table?
Phoebe  No thats what you do when you want to get the truth out of
someone.
Paul  (entering) Hi honey.
Rachel  Hi!
Phoebe  (To Rachel) Watch this.
Paul  (To Rachel) How are you?
Rachel  (To Phoebe) Okay.
Phoebe  Hi Paul!
Paul  Hi Phoebe.
Phoebe  So how are things going with you?
Paul  Cant complain.
Paul  (whispering) Come on.
Rachel  Okay. (Gets up and starts to leave with Paul.)
Paul  (To Ross) Hey!
Ross  Hi!
Paul  Ross!
Ross  Great to see you!
Paul  Good to see you too!
Ross  How you doing?
Paul  Good. Bye! (Starts to leave.)
Ross  Okay! You take care!
Ross  Hey Pheebs, what-what was the deal with you and Chandler blowing us off
before?
Phoebe  Yeah! That was so weird, huh?
Ross  Phoebe, whyd you do it?
Phoebe  I didnt do it! It was Chandler! Hes Hes mad at
you!
Ross  What?! Why?!
Phoebe  Please, I think you know why.
Ross  I cant think of anything.
Phoebe  Come on Ross, youre a paleontologist, dig a little deeper.
Ross  Wait a minute, is it because Joey and I didnt invite him to that
Knicks game a couple of weeks ago?
Phoebe  Do you think thats something that hed be mad at you for?
Ross  I guess it could.
Phoebe  Well then I think thats it.
Ross  Well, if hes angry, he really shouldnt just cover it up. I-I
wish he would just tell me the truth.
Phoebe  Oh, if thats what you want you then you really should run his head
under hot water and bang his head against a table.
[Scene  Joey and Rachel's, Paul and Rachel are getting ready to go out. Paul is
entering from the bathroom.]
Paul  Honey I made a reservation at China Garden, is that okay?
Rachel  Yeah thats great. But first, wait, talk to me, talk to me. Tell me
about your day.
Paul  It was fine.
Rachel  Okay. Hey, what are you thinking? What are you thinking right now?
Paul  Im thinking that you are looking really fine it that dress.
Rachel  Yeah thats great Paul, but yknow I wanna know
what(Puts her hands on his shoulders)Wow, those are really great! I just wanna
know what, what is behind this-this strong, silent exterior. Yknow they say that
still waters run deep and I wanna swim in yours.
Paul  Are you talking about having sex?
Rachel  No Paul, I dont know anything about you! Yknow, like-like
your childhood! Tell me about your childhood!
Paul  Normal.
Rachel  Okay, well then how about puberty! Come on, thats always a painful
time! Yknow your friends invite you to a slumber party and then they stick your hand
in warm water while youre sleeping so that you pee in your sleeping bag.
Paul  Nope! That never happened to me!
Rachel  Well, youre lucky you never met that bitch Sharon Majesky. Anyway,
umm The rest of you life, yknow? Any regrets?
Paul  Nope.
Rachel  All right Paul, Im not asking for a lot here. Okay? Just give me
something. Anything!
Paul  Okay.
Rachel  Okay.
Paul  Okay.
Rachel  All right.
Paul  When I was six years old.
Rachel  Hm-mmm.
Paul  I wanted a big wheel. And instead my parents got me this little plastic
chicken that you hop around on. It was embarrassing; kids made fun of me. That was a
pretty tough year.
Rachel  Thats-thats great! See? I already feel like I know you a
little better! Thank you. Okay, come on. Now we can go eat. Lets go. (Gets up to
leave, but Paul doesnt move.)
Paul  It was horrible. They called me chicken boy.
Rachel  Oh!
Paul  And in fifth grade I got into a fight. Well, it wasnt really a
fight. Richard Darinvel bit me on the nose and, and I feel down. I still have a little
scare right here (points to it) you can see it.
Rachel  Yeah. Yeah, I-I-I see the scare. Listen, Paul, I think this is really
great that-that yknow, you shared your feelings. Its really, its
beautiful, but umm, what do you say we go share some food?
Paul  Oh, I couldnt eat now.
Rachel  What?! Wait! What are you talking about?! You love their Kung Pao
Chicken!
Paul  Chicken? (Pointing to himself.) Chicken boy!
Rachel  My God, Im sorry! Im sorry! I didnt mean to do that! I
wouldnt do that!
[Scene  A Jewelry Shop, Chandler and Phoebe are looking at engagement rings.]
Chandler  Nothin! This is the nine millionth ring store weve been too and
I cant find the perfect ring! (Goes over to another display counter and starts
pointing at rings.) Ugly ring! Ugly ring! Ugly ring! (Notices that one of the jewelers is
watching him.) Its a beautiful selection. (The jeweler walks away slowly.)
Phoebe  Okay, so maybe you dont get her a ring. Maybe you-maybe you do
something different. Yknow? Maybe you get her an engagement bracelet, yknow?
Or an engagement tiara? Orooh! An engagement Revolutionary War musket! (Picks one up
from the display in the corner.
Chandler  Yknow, Im so glad I picked you to help me with this.
Phoebe  Huh? Can you just imagine getting down on one knee and handing her this
gorgeous piece of weaponry?
Chandler  Yeah, Im gonna stick with the ring. (Goes to another display
counter.) Oh, this ones nice! (Pointing to another ring.) I like this one! Sir? Uh,
kind sir? Can I see this one?
Phoebe  (coming over after returning the musket) Wait a minute, no, this is,
this is the reason you brought me. Okay? I know how to haggle. So let me handle this from
here on out.
Male Jeweler  Can I help you?
Chandler  Uh-uh, yes. I would like to see that ring please.
Phoebe  Or not, whatever.
Male Jeweler  This ring is from the 1920s, its a one and a half carat
diamond with sapphires on either side.
Chandler  Sir, can I ask you to umm, could youhold out that ring and ask
me to marry you?
Male Jeweler  Okay. (Holds out the ring, deadpan.) Will you marry me?
Chandler  (choking up) Oh my God thats it, thats the ring! How much
is it?
Phoebe  Chandler, I-I will handle this! (To the jeweler) How much is it?
Male Jeweler  8,600.
Phoebe  We will give you $10.
Male Jeweler  (angrily) Are you interested in this ring?!
Chandler  Yes! Yes, but I can only pay $8,000.
Male Jeweler  Okay, I can let it go at eight.
Phoebe  We stand firm at $10.
Male Jeweler  (ignoring her) How would you like to pay?
Chandler  Uh, credit card. (Reaches for it then realizes) Oh no! No-no, but I
left my credit card with Joey. (To Phoebe) Okay, Ill go get it. You guard the ring.
Phoebe  Okay. (To the jeweler) Listen, Im sorry about before. Do you have
anything her for $10.
Male Jeweler  Uh yes, I have these two rather beautiful $5 bills. (Holds them up
from his pocket.)
Phoebe  Ill give you $1 for them.
[Scene  Central Perk, Ross and Joey are there.]
Ross  Hey, remember how Chandler and Phoebe blew us off yesterday?
Joey  No.
Ross  Remember? You-you were eating pizza.
Joey  Yeah.
Ross  Okay. Well, apparently Chandlers angry at us for not getting him a
ticket to that Knicks game a couple of weeks ago.
Joey  Oh, were supposed to just get him a ticket?! That guy is always
mooching off of us!
Ross  Yeah! Anyway, I-I still think we should try to patch things up,
yknow? Like uh, maybe we could get him to get tickets to another Knicks game and
invite him.
Joey  Oh wow thats a great idea! And I still have his credit card.
Gunther  (handing them the bill) Here you go.
Ross  Oh. (Starts to get his money)
Joey  Hey-hey-hey-ho-ho, I got this one. Here you go. (Hands Gunther
Chandlers card.) Yknow I gotta tell ya, sometimes I justI dont get
Chandler. Yknow, me and him do stuff all the time without you and you dont get
all upset.
Ross  All the time?
Joey  All the time!
[Scene  Monica, Chandler, and Phoebe's, Monica is there as Rachel enters.]
Rachel  Oh my God! Oh my God!!
Monica  Still crying?
Rachel  Like a little girl. I know. I know. I know. This is all my fault;
I wanted him to open up. But God, I didnt know that I was gonna unleash this-this
weepy, clingy, moist monster!
Monica  Yknow, I only know of two surefire ways to shut a man up. And one
of them is sex.
Rachel  Whats the other one?
Monica  I dont know, Ive never had to use the other one. Im
just saying yknow, if were having sex, hes not gonna be talking.
Rachel  Oh thats right. Youre the talker. (They both reflect on that
briefly) Anyway uh, great idea! Umm, I gotta go to the store; I told him that I would buy
him some more tissues.
Monica  Oh, we have some
Rachel  No you dont!
[Scene  The Jewelry Store, Phoebe is busy trying on virtually everything in the store.
Shes got earrings, rings, bracelets, and enough necklaces to put Mr. T to shame on.]
Phoebe  Okay umm, Id also like to try on the tiara. (The male jeweler
hands it to her.) Oh yeah. Okay. (Puts it on.) (To the jeweler) What do you think, too
much?
Male Jeweler  A tad.
Phoebe  Okay. Then, take the tiara back and let me hold the musket again. (He
hands it to her and Phoebe poses in front of one of those small mirrors.) Somethings
missing. Its not Okay oh, let me see the ring my friend picked out.
Male Jeweler  (to the female jeweler) Wheres the 1920s princess cut ring.
Female Jeweler  I just sold it to that gentleman. (Points to the one walking out
the store.)
Phoebe  Oh my God!! (She runs after him, but sets of the security system, which
locks the stores door and brings down a set of bars behind her, caging her in.) No!
What?! Help me! Let me out! Now! (Points the musket at them.)
[Scene  Joey and Rachel's, Paul is still crying as Chandler enters.]
Paul  Rachel?
Chandler  No. How are ya Paul? (Starts to look for his credit card.)
Paul  (acting manly to try and cover up his crying) Okay. Chandler, did your dad
ever hug you?
Chandler  No, did he hug you?!
Paul  No! No! Its just that, my dad never did. I miss my dad.
Chandler  Well, you can see my dad in Vegas kissing other dads.
Paul  Hey Chandler?
Chandler  Yeah?
Paul  Would you.Would you hug me?
Chandler  Im a little busy here Paul.
Paul  Thats exactly what my dad used to say! (Starts to breakdown again.)
Chandler  Okay, a quick one. Come on hug it out. (Paul rushes over and hugs
Chandler tightly.) Oh hey! There you go. (The hug continues.) Okay. (The hug continues.)
Paul  Five more seconds.
Chandler  Okay! (Pushes him away.)
Joey  (entering) Hey!
Paul  Joey! (Goes over and hugs Joey and picks him off of his feet.)
Joey  Whoa-whoa-hey-hey! (Motions to Chandler, "Whats going
on?") Hi, Paul is it? (Paul nods yes and still hugging Joey.)
Chandler  Do you have my credit card?
Joey  Yes, its in my Inin my pocket. (Paul hasnt dropped
him yet.) (Chandler starts to reach for his front pocket.) My back pocket! My back pocket!
Chandler  Thank God! (Grabs his card.)
Joey  Oh hey listen I got us tickets to a Knicks game tonight.
Chandler  Oh, I cant go.
Joey  Come on! Itll be fun! Me, you, and Ross, and Paul
probably
[Scene  The Jewelry Store, Chandler is entering with his credit card and Phoebe is
holding out another ring for him.]
Phoebe  Chandler, I found the perfect ring. (Holding it out for her.)
Chandler  Oh, thats uh, thats pretty nice but Im gonna go with
the one I picked first.
Phoebe  Oh my God Chandler, the one you picked is gone. Its over!
Chandler  What?
Phoebe  Some guy bought it. Im sorry. I tired to stop it but they (points
to the jeweler) put me in jail!
Chandler  They put you in jail?
Phoebe  The little jail between the doors!
Chandler  Phoebe, I asked you to guard the ring!
Phoebe  I know, Im sorry! But yknow, this ring is better! Monica
never even saw the other ring.
Chandler  Yeah but when he proposed to me with the ring I got goose bumps.
Phoebe  Maybe it was the guy.
Chandler  It was the ring!
[Scene  Central Perk, Ross is on the couch and Joey is entering.]
Ross  Hey! So uh, was he excited about the tickets?
Joey  No! He blew us off!
Ross  What?!
Joey  I know!
Ross  I cant believe it. (Pause) Can I tell you something? Im a
little mad at him now.
Joey  Can I tell you something? Me too.
Ross  Yknow what? He didnt want to talk to us about being angry,
well maybe we dont talk to him at all!
Joey  Ooooh! Freeze him out.
Ross  Thats right!
Joey  I like it!
Ross  Eh? Well show him!
Joey  From now on, its gonna be Joey and Ross, best friends. (They shake
hands.) Okay! Were gonna be the new Joey and Chandler.
[Scene  Joey and Rachel's, Paul is writing something as Rachel enters.]
Rachel  Hi. Im back.
Paul  Hey! I have so much more to tell ya, Ive written it all down!
Rachel  Ah thats great. No actually thats (In a sexy voice)
Thats great! Thats really great! Yknow, I gotta tell ya writing, I mean
writing, gets me uh, gets me kinda hot.
Paul  Wait! Wait! Listen! Listen to this! (Flips a couple pages and points to
something.) Yknow what I wanted to be when I was that age?
Rachel  A lover?
Paul  A surfer.
Rachel  Oh yeah surfer?
Paul  I wanted to be one with the waves, yknow?
Rachel  Okay, hold on real quick, hold on a second let me just uh, (sits on the
counter and buttons her sweater to show some cleavage) get a little more comfortable here.
Wait, now wait a second, this isnt too revealing is it?
Paul  (barely glancing at her) No. What ever happened to that little dude.
(Pause) So full of dreams
Rachel  I dont care about the little dude! I cant! I cannot listen
to anymore of this! Yknow, the only person who would want to listen to this is a
mental health professional! And then its only because they get paid $100 an hour! Do
you know how much money I couldve made listening to you? $2,000! And do you know
when I figured that out? While you were talking!
Paul  What?! I cant believe youre trying to stifle me! When just 14
hours ago we figured out that that is exactly what my mother was trying to do to me!
Rachel  Oh Im sorry. I I-I dont meanI didnt
mean to stifle you. I This is all just a little overwhelming.
Paul  Oh Rachel, Im so sorry. I didnt mean to overwhelm you.
Its just that, when those gates open, you (Starts to breakdown.) Hard to close
em. But they are closed now. Believe me.
Rachel  Im so glad, Im so glad you shared. (Feeling his shoulder.)
And Im glad that youre done. What do you say we umm (Nods in the
direction of the bedroom.)
Paul  I would really like that. (They kiss.)
[Scene  Rachels Bedroom, Paul and Rachel are recovering.]
Paul  That wasso good. (Starts crying again.)
[Scene  Monica, Chandler, and Phoebe's, Chandler is looking at the ring he bought and
not liking it.]
Phoebe  (entering from her room) Hey.
Chandler  I cant believe I let you talk me into buying this stupid gumball
machine looking ring!
Phoebe  Its not a stupid gumball machine looking ring! Its a
beautiful ring!
Chandler  No, its not! When I looked at the other ring I could see
Monicas face when I gave it to her, yknow? And I could see her saying yes.
When I look at this ring, all I see is a ring! Unless I look at it really closely and then
I can see my own eye. (Does so and laughs.) Look, this is the most important thing
Im gonna do in my life. I wanna make sure its perfect.
Phoebe  Okay. There may be a way that we can get the other ring back.
Cause I heard the guy tell the jeweler where he was going to propose. So maybe we
can get him to trade rings or something.
Chandler  I cant do that.
Phoebe  Well you certainly cant give her that stupid gumball ring.
[Scene  A Restaurant, Chandler and Phoebe are entering. This is the place where the guy
who bought Chandlers ring is going to propose.]
Phoebe  There he is! (Points.)
Chandler  Okay and he hasnt proposed yet because she has no ring on her
finger.
Phoebe  Wow! Youre good! After this, we should solve crimes.
Chandler  Yeah! Okay, go, go, go get him.
Phoebe  Oh, okay. (Walks over to him.) Excuse me sir? Could you come with me
please? You have a phone call.
Customer  Who is it?
Phoebe  It is your office.
Customer  Do you know who at my office?
Phoebe  John?
Customer  Oh John! Great!
Phoebe  (To Chandler) Here he is.
Chandler  (to him) Hi! Hi. Okay, there was a slight mix-up at the jewelry store,
the ring youre about to propose with was supposed to be held for me. So, Im
gonna need to have that back. (The guy isnt sure.) But, in exchange Im willing
to trade you this beautiful, more expensive ring. (Looking at the ring.) Ew.
Phoebe  Wow! I would trade.
Customer  It is beautiful, but Im gonna use this one. Now, if youll
excuse me.
Chandler  No-no! This is my fiancee (Phoebe) and her heart was set on that ring.
You dont want to break her heart now do you?
Phoebe  Yeah, do you want to break a dying womans heart?
Customer  Youre dying?!
Chandler  Yeah, shes dying Of a cough apparently.
Phoebe  Yes, and it is my dying wish to have that ring. See, if Im not
buried with that ring then my spirit is going to wander the nether world for all
eternity
Chandler  (interrupting her) Okay, thats enough honey!
Customer  I dont know. (Pause) Let me see the ring.
Chandler  Great! Okay, here. (Holds the ring up for him.)
Customer  (looks at it) All right. (Exchanges rings.)
Chandler  Thank you. Thank you. Thank you! (To his girlfriend) And you
are about to marry a wonderful man! (She stunned and hes horrified.) Hey! Im
marrying a dead woman!
[Scene  Joey and Rachel's, Joey and Ross are watching TV as Chandler enters.]
Chandler  Guys? (They ignore him.) Ive got something important to tell ya.
(Still nothing so he walks over and stands in front of the TV.) Guys? (They lean over to
try and watch the TV, Chandler mimics them.) Guys?! (Pause) Im gonna ask Monica to
marry me.
Joey  (To Ross) I think we gotta end the freeze out.
Ross  Wait a minute, is this, is this for real?
Chandler  Yeah, check out the ring. (Shows it to them.)
Joey  Oh my God!!
Ross  So you two are really serious?!
Chandler  Yep, pretty much.
Ross  You-youre gonna get married?! I mean Were gonna be
brothers-in-law! (They hug.)
Joey  And-and-and-and-and-and, and were gonna be friends again!
Chandler  (goes to hug him and stops short) HeyyyyWhat?
Joey  Oh its water under the bridge, forget it!
Chandler  Okay! (They hug.) I was gonna wait til uh, it was official
yknow? But I got so excited I just had to tell you guys because youre my best
friends.
Joey  I think Im gonna cry!
Rachel  (who has just entered) Ugh! No more crying! Please! I just dumped one
cry baby, Ill dump you too!
Chandler  Im gonna ask Monica to marry me.
Rachel  Oh my God! Oh my God! Oh Chandler!! (Hugs him.) You guys are gonna be so
happy!
Chandler  I know.
Joey  (holding an empty tissue box) Wheres all the tissues?! (Throws the
box down in disgust.)
[Scene  Joey and Rachel's, continued from earlier. Chandler is showing Rachel the
ring.]
Chandler  Check out the ring.
Rachel  (gasps) Nice! One and a half carat easy.
Phoebe  (entering) Hi.
Ross  Hey-hey Pheebs!
Phoebe  What?
Ross  Chandlers gonna ask Monica to marry him!
Phoebe  Oh I know, I helped pick out the ring.
Ross  You told her before you told us?
Chandler  Well, she walked in when I was looking at the ring brochures. You can
understand that, right? (Ross and Joey look at each other and go back to watching the game
on TV.) Guys? Guys? (Walks in front of them again.)

[Scene  Monica, Chandler, and Phoebe's, Chandler is showing Ross, Rachel, Joey, and
Phoebe his engagement ring again.]
Ross  God that is the most beautiful engagement ring ever!
Rachel  Yeah? Well, you should know. Youve bought like a billion of
em.
Ross  Yeah, you didnt get one.
Chandler  Okay, well tonights the big night.
Phoebe  Yeah!
Joey  Okay listen, how are you gonna ask her?
Chandler  It is going to be perfect. I am taking her to her favorite restaurant.
Im going to get her a bottle of the champagne that she really loves; therefore knows
how expensive it is. Then when the glasses are full, instead of proposing a toast Im
just gonna propose.
Rachel  Ohh
Joey  That sounds perfect!
Chandler  Yeah.
Joey  Youre gonna mess it up let me do it.
Chandler  Im not gonna mess it up.
Phoebe  If she says no, can I have the ring?
Chandler  Shes not gonna say no.
Phoebe  If!
Monica  (entering) Hey!
Ross  Hey!
Chandler  Hey!
Phoebe  (with her mouthful) Hi Monica.
Chandler  (To Phoebe) Give me it!
Phoebe  Its gone.
Chandler  Phoebe!
Joey  Hey!
Chandler  (with his mouthful) Hi Monica.
Phoebe  (To Chandler) Were practically kissing. (Makes a kissy face and
winks at him.)
[Scene  Central Perk, Monica, Chandler, Phoebe, and Joey are there as Rachel enters.]
Rachel  (entering) Hey!
Chandler  Hey!
Joey  Hey Rach!
Rachel  Are any of you guys free tonight? My boss is hosting this charity event
for underprivileged kids and the more people I bring, the better I look. So, Monica?
Chandler?
Chandler  (glaring at her) Well, Monica and Chandler cant go. Were
going to dinner remember?!
Rachel  Oh my God, Im so sorry.
Monica  Whats the big deal?
Chandler  I just get mad when Rachel doesnt remember where were
going.
Joey  Where are you going?
Rachel  How about you guys? (Points to Phoebe and Joey.)
Phoebe  Open bar?
Rachel  I think so.
Phoebe  I can do that for the kids.
Joey  Hey, yknow what? Ill come too. Im making money now;
its about time I give something back.
Chandler  Well, you could also give back the money you owe me.
Joey  Okay. Have a benefit.
Ross  (entering) Hey!
Rachel  Hey! Ross, listen can you come to a charity event tonight?
Ross  Oh no, I have plans with Elizabeth.
Chandler  Oh, so youre already doing your part for the kids.
Ross  Im sorry, its just one of my last nights together before she
leaves for campto be a counselor!
Monica  Ross let me ask you a question. All jokes aside, where is this
relationship going?
Chandler  Wait a minute, all jokes aside? I didnt agree to that!
Monica  Do you really see this as a long-term thing?
Ross  I dont know.
Phoebe  Yknow, you are 12 years older than her.
Ross  Wait a minute, does-does everyone feel this way?
All  Yeah! Yeah, sort of. Im sorry.
Ross  Uh-uhWow! Uh, I thought you guys were just like making jokes, I had
no idea. What you know what? You guys are wrong. Uh yes, there is a chronological age
difference but I never notice it. You know why? Because she is very mature. Besides, it
doesnt really matter to me what you guys think. I mean, Im the one dating
Elizabeth, not you!
Joey  Thats not what she said last night. (Ross glares at him.)
Rachel  See? Now, he could date her.
[Scene  Monica, Chandler, and Phoebe's, Chandler is practicing proposing.]
Chandler  Will you marry me? Will you marry me? (Makes like a gun with
his fingers.) Hey, you marry me! (He gives up as Joey, Rachel, Phoebe, and Ross slink in
all excited.) Whats going on little elves?
Joey  Its the big night! We wanted to wish you good luck!
Ross  Yeah, yeah you have the ring?
Chandler  Yeah, right here in my pocket. (Pats his pocket. Phoebe smiles, goes
over to hug him, and removes the ring from his pocket.) Pheebs?
Phoebe  Oh! Oop! (Hands him back the ring.)
Chandler  Okay, now will you guys get out of here? I want this is to be a
surprise and shes gonna know.
Ross  (to the rest of them) Yeah-yeah you guys. Get out of here!
Monica  Hi guys.
Chandler  (To Monica) You are beautiful.
Monica  Oh, thank you! (The gang exhibits signs of quiet apprehension and wears
knowing glances.) (Monica giggles.) Whats going on?
Rachel  (breaking up) Were just reallyvery excited about this
charity event that we have to go to.
[Scene  The Charity Event, theyre holding a silent auction, Rachel is looking at
one of the items and Phoebe walks up and hands her a glass of wine.]
Phoebe  Here.
Rachel  Oh! Thank you!
Phoebe  So now whats going on here?
Rachel  Uh well, uh this is a silent auction. They lay out all the stuff here
and then you write down your offer and then the highest bid gets it.
Phoebe  No, I know what a silent is I meant, whats going on with your
hair?
Rachel  (suddenly worried) Uh, wh-why?
Phoebe  No! Its nice!
Mr. Thompson  Nice to see you Rachel.
Rachel  Oh, hi!
Mr. Thompson  So glad you brought someone.
Rachel  Someone? I brought people. Mr. Thompson, this is Phoebe. Phoebe, this is
Mr. Thompson. (She introduces them.) Hes the head of my department.
Phoebe  Oh, hi. (They shake hands.)
Rachel  And I also brought my friend Joey
Joey  (behind them) Oh!! Shrimp toast! (Walks right past the little group on his
way for the shrimp toast.)
Rachel  Well, yknow I-I dont know where he is.
Mr. Thompson  Well, I hope youre gonna bid on some things Rachel.
Rachel  Well, yknow what? Actually, I was about to bid on this lovely trip
to Paris.
Mr. Thompson  Ohh, nice choice.
Rachel  Yeah.
Mr. Thompson  Good luck.
Rachel  Thank you. (Mr. Thompson walks away and after hes left.) Okay,
(writing her bid down) twenty dollars.
[Scene  Elizabeths Dorm Room, Ross is walking up to her door and knocks on it.
Suddenly the door opens and Elizabeth drags him into the room.]
{Transcribers Note  Elizabeth has two friends in the room with her who are named
in the credits, but not in this scene. So Im just gonna guess since it doesnt
matter one way or the other. (The last part is to discourage e-mails, who cares if I got
it right or not?)}
Zoe  Shut the door! Shut the door!! (Runs over and closes the door.)
Ross  Whats-whats going on?
Elizabeth  The guys across the hall are throwing water balloons at us.
Ross  Oh, you have to call the police! Thats what I did to the kids in my
building!
Elizabeth  No, its a water balloon fight! We started it!
Ross  Oh! (Does a laugh/groan.) Listen umm, I, I just stopped by to see if you
wanted to see this play tonight. Umm, its supposed to be excellent. The director is
the same
Elizabeth  (ignoring him and picking up a pitcher) Who drank all the Kamikazes?
Sarah  (approaching with two filled balloons in her hands) Nobody! We put them
in here! (Indicates the aforementioned balloons causing both of them to scream in delight
and start drinking from the balloons.)
Elizabeth  (To Ross) You want some?! (Starts to squirt the Kamikaze at him.)
Ross  No! Okay! Okay! (Stops her.) Okay, look, can I, can I just-just talk to
you for a second?
Elizabeth  Yeah, sure.
Ross  Uh, so this play umm, what do you think? Its-its gotten great
reviews! Yknow the uh
First Dorm Guy  Attack!
Second Dorm Guy  Put your balloons down!
The Girls 
First Dorm Guy  You put your balloons down!!
Ross  (screaming) Everybody put their balloons down!!! (There is a
temporary cease fire.) Now this is a nice suit!! (Shows everyone where he was hit.)
[Scene  The Charity Event, Mr. Thompson is announcing the winners of the silent
auction.]
Mr. Thompson  Our next item is the romantic trip to Paris. (Pause.) It goes to
Emil Alexander high a high bid of 2,300.
Rachel  Ugh! So close!
Phoebe  Hey you guys! Look!
Joey  Hey!
Phoebe  I got me some drinks!
Rachel  What are you doing?
Phoebe  Open bar!
Rachel  Well now its an empty bar.
Phoebe  You just cant stand anyone else enjoying themselves cant
you?
Mr. Thompson  And finally, our biggest item of the night, the 22-foot
gentlemans day sailer sailboat. The winning bid was a whooping $20,000! (Joey
suddenly gets excited.)
Joey  I won! That was my guess!
Rachel  What?! What?! What?!
Joey  I guessed 20,000!
Rachel  Joey! It is an auction! You dont guess, you buy!
Joey  What?! I dont have 20,000!
Mr. Thompson  Congratulations on your new boat, Joey Tribbiani!!
Rachel  Joey! Sit down! (Pulls him down.)
Phoebe  Forget her! You enjoy this!! (Pulls him back up and starts applauding
again. Joey waves and does a salute.]
[Scene  A Restaurant, Monica and Chandler are sitting at a table. Monica is checking
her makeup as Chandler suddenly has a horrifying thought and starts patting down his
pockets until he finds what hes looking for and sighs in relief.]
Monica  What are you doing?
Chandler  (trying to cover up why his hand is over his heart) One nation, under
God. Indivisible with liberty and justice for all. (Laughs.) I remembered it. (Its a
butchered version of the Pledge of Allegiance of the United States for our foreign
friends.) The champagne is here. (The waiter is delivering it and pouring two glasses.)
Monica  Are you okay?
Chandler  Yes! Yes! Im good! Are you good? Are you good? Is
everythingare youare you perrr-perfect?!
Monica  Yeah. Im okay. Im actuallyIm a little cold, can
I have your jacket?
Chandler  Oh, yeah. (Starts to take it off and then realizes) Uh, no you
cant have my jacket! Because then I would be cold! If you thought that you were
going to be cold, you shouldve brought your own jacket. But uh, other than that, are
you okay? Are you okay?
Monica  (laughs) Are you sure youre okay?
Chandler  Yes! Im fine. In fact Ive been fine for a long time now
and I think, the reason is you.
Monica  Ohh thats sweet!
Chandler  Okay umm, before I meant you I had really little life and I
couldnt imagine growing old with
Monica  (interrupting him) Oh my God!
Chandler  (not knowing the true meaning of her exclamation) I know, but just let
me say it.
Monica  Oh my God, Richard. (Yep, Richards back.)
Chandler  What?! Im Chandler! (She nods towards the doorway, Chandler
turns and looks) Oh, thats Richard!
Monica  Oh God, maybe he wont see us. Richard!
Richard  (approaching them with a woman in tow) Monica! Chandler!
Chandler  Hey-hey, hey! (Gets up and hugs him.) I dont know why I did
that!
Monica  Hey, its good to see you!
Richard  You too, you let uh, your hair grow long.
Monica  YeahOh thats right. You, you always wanted me too. Hey, I
see you got your mustache back.
Richard  Well, my nose got lonely.
Chandler  (to Richards date) And uh, you dont have a mustache which
is good. (She just smiles.) Im Chandler; I make jokes when Im uncomfortable.
Richards Date 
Chandler  Hi.
Richard  Oh, Im sorry. (Introduces them.) Lisa, (nodding at each) Monica,
Chandler. We used to date.
Chandler  Richard! No one supposed to know about us! (Richard just smiles at
him.) See I, did it again.
Monica  Chandler, wh-why dont we sit down?
Chandler  Yeah, Ill sit down. (He slides back into his chair.)
Monica  (to Richard) Its good to see you
Matire'd  (to Richard) Youre tables ready sir.
Richard  Oh. Good to see you guys.
Chandler  Yes. (Thinking hes gone.)
Matire'd  (motioning to the empty table next to Monica and Chandlers) Or
if you prefer, this table is available.
Richard  That might be fun. (Richard and Lisa sit down.)
[Scene  The Charity Event, Rachel, Phoebe, and Joey are sitting at their table.]
Rachel  What were you thinking?!
Joey  I didnt know it was an auction!
Rachel  Wh?!
Joey  I figured, take a guess, help a charity, free boat!
Rachel  Why would a charity give away a free boat?!
Joey  I dont know! Charity?
Rachel  Ugh!
Phoebe  Well, just buy the damn boat! (Shes still working her way through
her tray of booze.)
Rachel  Phoebe, dont you think youve had enough to drink?
Phoebe  Im just helping the kids!
Rachel  How is you drinking helping the kids?
Phoebe  Because the more I drink, the less there is for the kids to drink.
Mr. Thompson  (approaching) Mr. Tribbiani.
Joey  Oh hi!
Mr. Thompson  Your generous contribution brings us a big step closer to building
the youth center.
Joey  Just out of curiosity, how-how much is that boat worth?
Mr. Thompson  I think it was valued at 19,000
Joey  (To Rachel) Hey, I was pretty close. (She just glares at him.) Uhh, so bad
news. Umm, I cant buy the boat, I dont have any money.
Rachel  Joey! Joey, good one! (Mr. Thompson starts to laugh.)
Mr. Thompson  Thats good. Very good! (Walks away.)
Joey  So uh listen, I think Im gonna take off now. (Starts to get up.)
Rachel  (stopping him) Hey! Youcantleave Joey! You agreed to
buy that boat, all right?! That is a contract! And plus if you leave, my boss is gonna
kill me!
Joey  Well, what am I gonna do Rach?! I dont have that kind of money!
Rachel  I know. Okay. (Whispering and thinking.) Okay. Okay. All right. All
right, this is what were gonna do, we are gonna go to the next highest bidder, and
we are just gonna let them buy it, and then youre just gonna pay the difference.
Joey  Okay.
Rachel  Okay.
Joey  Look, I dont know why the kids need a youth center anyway!
Yknow? They should just watch TV after school like I did and I turned out fine!
Rachel  Not great.
[Scene  The Restaurant, Monica and Chandlers and Richard and Lisas tables
have been pushed together and theyre all eating and talking.]
Monica  And so, were hiding in the bathroom.
Richard  And-and then I sneak out and before Monica can her parents come in.
Monica  So I hide in the shower and the next thing you know theyre going
at it right on the bathroom floor.
Lisa  (laughing) Oh my God!
{Transcribers Note  For further reading on the above story, please check out The One Where Joey Moves Out.}
Chandler  I got a good one, I got a good one! I once walked in on both my
parents making love to the same guy.
Richard  Its so great seeing you guys again. Id like to make a
toast. (Everyone raises their glasses) Uh, as a poet once said, "In the sweetness of
friendship, let there be laughter and sharing of pleasures for in the due of little things
the heart finds its morning and is refreshed."
Monica  Ohh.
Chandler  What?!
[Scene  Monica, Chandler, and Phoebe's, Monica and Chandler are returning to find Ross
is there waiting for them.]
Ross  Oh my God, you guys!! (Hes excited about what he thought happened.)
Chandler  (stopping him from going any further) Before you say anything, have we
got a story for you! Guess who we bumped into at dinner!
Ross  Who?
Chandler  Richard!
Ross  What? (Excited) A-ohh! (Realizes) Ohh. Oh thats right thats
right. Thats Richards favorite place too.
Chandler  Oh you knew that. Good!
Monica  I thought you were going out with Elizabeth.
Ross  Yeah, I was but uh, she was a little busy with a water balloon fight.
Monica  Oh Ross, sometimes grown-ups have commitments they just cant get
out of!
Ross  Yknow, maybe she is too young for me. Yknow, when I was over
there and she was running around with her friends, I felt like I was a baby-sitter. I
finally started to see what you guys were talking about. I dont know what to do.
Monica  Why dont you just weigh out the good stuff about the relationship
against the bad stuff. I mean thats what I did when I first (looks at Chandler and
pauses) weighing stuff.
Ross  Okay umm, bad stuff. Well, Im-Im 12 years older than she is.
Monica  If the school finds out youre fired.
Ross  Hmm.
Monica  Shes leaving for three months.
Chandler  For camp!
Ross  Okay, good stuff. Umm, well shes-shes sweet and pretty
and
Monica  Look Ross, the only question you need to ask is, "Do you see a
future?" I mean like do you see yourself marrying her? (Ross pauses in
consideration.) Oh my God! You did it already! You married her, didnt you?!
Ross  No! No! Ididnt do that. Its just Okay, honestly
no. I dont, I dont see a big future with her.
Monica  Okay well I thinkthats your answer.
Ross  Ive got to talk to her. Ugh, I hate this part.
Chandler  Hey, you have to forget about Elizabeth. I mean if youre not
careful you may not get married at all this year!
[Scene  The Charity Event, Rachel and Phoebe are sitting at the table as Joey
approaches.]
Joey  Rach! Rachel! Okay, the next highest bidder is at table one.
Rachel  Oh great!
Joey  (To Phoebe) Oh and uh the guy who got the Paris trip is at table four.
Phoebe  Oh, okay.
Rachel  (To Phoebe) Why do you care about the guy who won the Paris trip?
Phoebe  Its a trip for two! (She gets up and takes off her blouse-type
thingy shes wearing over her dress.) Excuse me. (She walks over to table four.)
Excuse me, is the person who won the Paris trip at this table?
Emil Alexander  That was me.
Phoebe  Oh, en chante. (She holds out her hand for him to kiss it, but he only
shakes it.)
{Transcribers Note  Please correct my French here.}
Joey  Uhh, excuse me is there a Mr. Bowmont at this table?
Mr. Bowmont  Thats me.
Joey  Ahh, yes. (Pushes Rachel in front of himself so that she could do the
talking.)
Rachel  Oh well, hello. This is your lucky day Mr. Bowmont, the uh gentleman day
sailer as just become available again and I believe that you made a bid of $18,000.
Joey  You-you have to pay that! Its not just a guess.
Rachel  (To Joey) Okay. Okay. (Shushes him.)
Mr. Bowmont  I was actually relieved uh I didnt win the boat. My wife
wouldve killed me.
Rachel  Ohh
Joey  Are you kidding me?! Shes gonna this boat!
Rachel  Y-Yeah! What-what is your wifes name?
Mr. Bowmont  Its Pam.
Rachel  Pam! Oh God okay, just imagine this, "The Pam."
Joey  Aw-awww!
Mr. Bowmont  I dont think shed like that.
Rachel  Okay, uh-uh imagine this, "The Mr. Bowmont."
Joey  Oooooh
Mr. Bowmont  I dont think so dear.
Rachel  Okay look, let me paint you a little picture. (She sits down next to
him.) All right, you are settin sail up the Hudson! Youve got the wind in your
h(sees that hes bald)arms! You-you get all that peace and quiet that
youve always wanted! You get back to nature! You can go fishin! You
canooh, you can get one of those little hats and have people call you captain, and
then when youre old, Cappy.
Mr. Bowmont  What the hell, its for a good cause! All right!
Joey  No way! Its mine!!
Rachel  (To Joey) What?! What?!
Joey  All that stuff you just said? I want that!
Rachel  But Joey you dont have $20,000!
Joey  Who cares?! I-Ill make payments, whatever it takes, I want the Mr.
Bowmont!!
[Scene  Monica, Chandler, and Phoebe's, Monica is taking out the garbage as Phoebe and
Joey enter. Phoebe gasps.]
Joey  Oh my God, youre back!
Phoebe  Ohh, let me see it! Let me see your hand! (Chandler is frantically
trying to wave them off.)
Monica  Why do you want to see my hand?
Phoebe  I wanna see whats in your hand. I wanna see the trash.
Joey  Yeah.
Phoebe  Eww! Oh, its all dirty. You should throw this out.
Monica  (suspiciously) Okay. (Exits to carry out Phoebes wishes.)
Chandler  (after the door closes) What did you guys just do?!
Phoebe  What happened?
Chandler  Richard was there so I couldnt do it!
Joey  What?! Noooo (Phoebe gasps.)
Chandler  Im gonna do it tomorrow yknow, and-and surprise her, but
now youve ruined it!
Joey  We didnt ruin it!
Chandler  Who walks into a room and asks to see a persons hands?!
Phoebe  Well, a palm reader, a manicurist, a hand doctor
Joey  Glove salesman!
Phoebe  Good one! Yeah.
Chandler  This is terrible. What am I going to do?
Phoebe  Look, she only suspects something okay? She doesnt know for sure,
so just throw her off the track.
Chandler  Thats right, I can throw her off. I can make her think marriage
is the last thing on my mind.
Phoebe  Yeah! Yeah! Convince her that-that youre scared of commitment!
Convince her that youre a little coward!
Chandler  I can do that, Ive had 30 years of practice.
Joey  Hey, being you is finally gonna pay off! (They give each other fives.)
Monica  (entering) I had to go all the way to the basement because some idiot
keeps stuffing the trash chute with pizza boxes!
Joey  That guys still doing that?!
Rachel  (entering) Hey! (Sees Monica, gasps, and runs over to her.) Oh my God
youre here, let me see your hand!!
Phoebe  No, youre too late!!! She already took out the trash!!!
[Scene  Outside of Elizabeths dormitory, Ross is exiting after breaking up with
her and we can hear his thoughts.]
Ross  (in his head) Wow! I have never had such a healthy break-up! She was
such a grown-up about it! She didnt seem too immature for me! Did I just make a huge
mistake?
Elizabeth  (sticking her head out her window) Ross! Wait!
Ross  Elizabeth, thank God! I was just thinking about
Elizabeth  You suck!!
Ross  What?!
Ross  Okay, break-ups still on!
[Scene  Central Perk, Chandler is looking out the window and Joey is sitting on the
couch.]
Chandler  Okay, okay, here she comes! (Sits on the couch next to him.) How do I
look? Do I look like a guy who doesnt want to get married?
Joey  Yeah! And also, a little like a French guy. (They both squint at each
other.) I never noticed that before.
Monica  (entering) Hi guys!
Joey  Hey!
Chandler  Hey!
Monica  What are you up too?
Chandler  Oh, just hanging out, talkin about uh, websites. (Joey laughs.)
Yeah, we saw this really interesting website about marriage and how totally unnecessary it
is and how its just a way for the government to keep tabs on you.
Joey  (laughs) Yeah, Big Brother.
Monica  Well thats a little crazy. Although I am yknow glad to hear
that youre branching out on what you look at on the Internet.
Chandler  Yeah, well Yknow, it just got me thinking though, why
would anybody ever want to get married huh?
Monica  Why?! To celebrate your relationship! To solidify your commitment! To
declare your love for one another to the world!
Chandler  Eh
Monica  Okay well thats good to know.
Joey  (all excited) The Mr. Bowmonts here!!! (Jumps over the back off the
couch and runs out into the street.)
[Scene  Monicas Restaurants kitchen, shes cooking as a waitress
sticks her head in.]
Waitress  Hey Monica, theres a customer who wants to complement the chef,
should I let him in?
Monica  Sure, I love this part! (Starts to look busy.)
Waitress  (to the customer) Come on in.
Richard  Hi!
Monica  Richard!
Richard  Actually, Im not here to complement the chef.
Monica  Ohh Oh, thats okay I hate when people come back to
complement the chef. Like I have nothing better to do! So whats up?
Richard  Well, it was great seeing you the other night.
Monica  Oh, good to see you too. Did you come down here to tell me that?
Richard  No! I came here to tell you something else. (Pause) I came here (Pause)
to tell you I still love you.
[Scene  Monicas Restaurant, continued from earlier.]
Monica  What uhWhat did youWhat?!
Richard  I still love you. And I know I probably shouldnt even be here
telling you this, I mean youre with Chandler a guy I really like, and if you say
hes straight Ill believe you! After seeing ya the other night I knew if I
didnt tell ya Id regret it for the rest of my life. Letting you go was the
stupidest thing I ever did.
Monica  Yknow youre really not supposed to be back here!
Richard  Well yeah, Im sorry. I know this is the wrong time and the wrong
place but I had to tell ya! I wanna spend my life with you. I wanna marry you. I wanna
have kids with you.
Monica  Oh God (Starts looking around.) Why dont they put chairs
back here?!
Richard  I know this is crazy but am I too late?
Monica  What the Yes youre too late! Where was all this three years
ago?!
Richard  Well I know I was an idiot! And I tried to forget you, I really did!
Yknow after we had lunch last year I spent six months in Africa trying to get
you out of my head!
Monica  What were you doing in Africa?
Richard  Working with blind kids.
Monica  Ohhh! What are you doing to me?! Oh look, I-I Im sorry but
umm, this-this-this-this is not going to happen.
Richard  Okay thats fine, Ill walk away. And Ill never bother
you again, but only if you tell me Chandlers willing to give you everything I
am.
Monica  Well he is! Yeah, I mean marriage is all he talks about! My goodness, in
fact, Im the one thats making him wait!
Richard  You are?
Monica  Yeah!
Richard  Why?
Monica  Why? Because of the government.
[Scene  Central Perk, Rachel is bringing Phoebe some coffee.]
Rachel  Isnt it incredible?! Monica and Chandler, gettin married.
Phoebe  I know, theyre gonna be so happy together.
Rachel  Ohh I mean two best friends falling in love, how often does that
happen?
Phoebe  Not that often!
Rachel  No! Im so happy for them!
Phoebe  Me too! So happy for them!
Rachel  Im so happy and not at all jealous.
Phoebe  Oh no! No God, definitely not jealous!
Rachel  I mean Im probably 98% happy, maybe 2% jealous. And I mean
whats 2%? Thats nothing.
Phoebe  Totally. Im like 90/10.
Rachel  Yeah me too.
Joey  Hey uh, have you guys scene Chandler?
Rachel  (staring at him) Whno, but yknow who did stop in here
looking for ya, Tennille.
[Scene  A Pizza Joint, Chandler and Monica are eating lunch.]
Monica  So that marriage stuff that you were saying yesterday, you dont
really believe that do you?
Chandler  Sure I do. In fact, I think the whole concept of marriage is
unnatural. I mean look at pigs. Lets take a second here and look at pigs. Okay pigs
dont mate for life. I mean a pig can have like a hundred sexual partners in a
lifetime, and thats just an ordinary pig not even a pig thats good at sports!
Monica  Yeah, but thats pigs not people!
Chandler  If marriage worked, Id be all for it. But do you know what the
divorce rate in this country is? 97%.
Monica  Wait a minute. Are you honestly telling me that-that you may never
want to get married?
Chandler  Well, never say never but yknow probably uh yeah, never.
Monica  Oh my God! Then-then-then what are we even doing?! What is this?!
Chandler  Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! What is all this pressure?! Is this some new kind of
strategy? Why dont you put down your copy of The Rules huh mantrap?!
Monica  Yknow what?! I gotta go! Ugh!
Chandler  (to them) Its okay, I got a plan.
[Scene  Central Perk, Phoebe and Rachel are still talking.]
Rachel  Were gonna find love!
Phoebe  Definitely!
Rachel  Yeah, Im pretty confident about that. Thats what makes it so
easy for me to be 80% happy for Monica and Chandler! It would be nice to have a little
guarantee though.
Phoebe  What do you mean?
Rachel  Well yknow, some people make deals with a friend, like if neither
of them are married by the time theyre 40, they marry each other.
Phoebe  You mean a backup?
Rachel  Exactly!
Phoebe  Yeah, yeah I got that.
Rachel  You do?
Phoebe  Hm-mmm.
Rachel  Who?
Phoebe  Joey.
Rachel  Joey?!
Phoebe  Yeah!
Rachel  Are you serious?!
Phoebe  Yeah, I locked him years ago!
Rachel  Wh So If neither of you are married by the time youre
40, youre gonna marry Joey.
Phoebe  Yep, we shook on it. Yeah but believe me that is not how he wanted to
seal the deal.
Rachel  Oh, seriously?
Phoebe  Ohh, yeah. I think his exact words were (She makes two clicking
sounds with her tongue and purrs.)
Rachel  Charming.
Phoebe  Well hey, its just a backup.
Rachel  Yeah.
[Scene  Joey and Rachel's, Joey, still looking like Captain Stubing, is practicing his
slipknots as Monica enters.]
Joey  Hey Monica!
Monica  Have you seen Rachel? Or a mirror?
Joey  This is for my boat, pretty cool huh?
Monica  Yeah, its great.
Joey  Whoa-whoa, whats the matter?! Talk to the captain!
Monica  Im just having one of those days where you realize youre in
a dead-end relationship!
Joey  Chandler giving you a hard time huh?
Monica  Its not like I want to get married tomorrow! Its just that
I-Id like to believe that Im in a relationship thats actually going
somewhere, that Im not just wasting my time!
Joey  Well, you know Chandler.
Monica  No I dont know Chandler! Not anymore! Its like its
like somethings changed.
Joey  Maybe you changed?
Monica  I didnt change!
Joey  Maybe thats the problem.
Monica  What?!
Joey  Chandler is a complex fellow, one who is unlikely to take a wife.
Monica  Is that some kind of boat talk?
Joey  I dont know! (All excited) I havent totally decided how to
talk on my boat yet.
Monica  What does he think? Does he think Im just gonna wait around for
nothing?
Joey  Monica face it, Chandler is against marriage. And-and always will be!
Monica  (starts for the door) Well theres some people who do want to marry
me.
Joey  There are?
Monica  Yeah! Richard!
Joey  R-R-Richard said he wants to marry you?! (Monica nods yes.) And-and
Chandlers tellin ya how much he hates marriage?!
Monica  Thats right.
Joey  Chandler loves marriage!!
Monica  You just told me that he hates marriage! That-that hes a-a complex
fellow whos unlikely to take a wife! That-that hes against marriage and always
will be!
Joey  You got that from what I said?!
[Scene  Ross's apartment, Ross is watching a show about the extinction of the
dinosaurs.]
Narrator 
Ross  What happened you guys?
Ross  Rach!
Rachel  Hey you!
Ross  Hey, come on in.
Rachel  Oh thank you. Hey yknow, Im so sorry to hear about you and
Elizabeth.
Ross  Oh, thanks. Yeah, I really thought wed be able to make it work, but
uh, I guess it just wasnt meant to be.
Rachel  Yeah, love. Its a tricky business isnt it?
Ross  I guess so.
Rachel  So what do you say we make a pact? If you and I are both single by the
time were 40, we get married. I mean, we know each other, we like each other, and
weve-weve already slept together so yknow therell be no surprises
there! You know what I mean? No like, "Whats that?!"
Ross  Right. Ohh! You-you want me to be your backup.
Rachel  Exactly.
Ross  Ohh, yeah I already have one.
Rachel  What? Who?
Ross  Phoebe.
Rachel  Phoebe?! Wait abut-but she just, she said that Joey was her
backup.
Ross  Ohh, I dont think so.
Rachel  Ross! I just had a conversation with her, and she said that she and Joey
made a deal!
Ross  Thats impossible! I mean we have had a deal for years!
We-we-we shook on it, although believe me she wanted to do a lot more than that.
[Scene  Monica, Chandler, and Phoebe's, Chandler is entering to find Joey, still
looking like Captain Stubing, on the phone.]
Joey  Where the hell have you been?!
Chandler  I was making a coconut phone with the professor.
Joey  Richard told Monica he wants to marry her!
Chandler  What?!
Joey  Yeah! Yeah, Ive been trying to find ya to tell to stop messing with
her and maybe I would have if these (lifts a leg) damn boat shoes wouldnt keep
flying off!
Chandler  MyOh my God!
Joey  I know! They suck!!
Chandler  Hes not supposed to ask my girlfriend to marry him! Im
supposed to do that!
Joey  I know!
Chandler  Well what Yknow what Im gonna do? Im gonna go
over there; Im gonna kick his ass! (Pause) Will you help me?!
Joey  Look, Chandler I dont think us getting our asses kicked is a
solution. Okay? Just go and find Monica!
Chandler  Youre right.
Joey  Yeah!
Chandler  Okay. (Starts running for the bedroom) Im gonna get the ring!
Im gonna get the ring! (Does so) Im gonna go find her and (starts running for
the door) Im just going to propose!
Joey  Okay.
Chandler  Okay great.
Joey  Dude-dude-dude!
Chandler  What?!
Joey  Let me know about that coconut phone, it might great for the boat.
[Scene  Richards Apartment, hes smoking a cigar and reading a book as there
is a knock on the door. He gets up and opens the door to reveal]
Monica  Hi.
Richard  Hi.
Monica  I dont know why Im here.
Richard  I didnt ask. You wanna come in?
Monica  I dont know.
Richard  Oh, okay. Well, Ill just leave the door open and go sit on the
couch. (Does so.)
Monica  (entering) Chandler is such an idiot!
Richard  (standing up quickly) Drink?
Monica  Yeah, Ill have a scotch
Richard  on the rocks with a twist? I remember. (Goes to make her drink.)
Monica  (moving over to the couch) Still smoking cigars?
Richard  Uh, no! No! Thatsart! If it bothers you I can put my art
out.
Monica  No thats, thats okay.
Richard  So Monica let me ask you a question. Yknow, since we broke up do
you ever, think about me?
Monica  Uh yeah, I-I actually I thought about you a couple months ago.
Richard  Oh really?
Monica  Yeah but it was because I-I had an eye exam and I dont like my new
eye doctor.
Richard  Who is it?
Monica  Edward Nevski?
Richard  Yeah hes no good. Do you ever (pause) think about me in a (pause)
non-eye doctor way?
Monica  No.
Richard  Ahh.
Monica  But getting over was the hardest thing that Ive ever had to do.
And I never let myself think about you.
[Scene  Central Perk, Phoebe is reading as Rachel enters.]
Rachel  Phoebe! You picked Joey and Ross?! You can not have two backups!
Phoebe  Of course I can! Its just good sense to backup your backup! Look,
Ive already lost Chandler!
Rachel  What?!
Joey  (entering) Hey!
Ross  (entering) Hey!
Joey  Phoebe! Were both (points at Ross and himself) your backup?!
Ross  Phoebe, how could you do this to me?!
Phoebe  I dontLook I dont know what youre complaining
about now? You were both aware of the situation!
Joey  No we werent!
Ross  I was not!
Phoebe  Okay, this kind of back talk is not gonna fly when were married!
Rachel  Phoebe you cant have both of them! You have to pick one!
Joey  Pick me!!
Ross  No! Pick me! I dont want to end up an old maid!
Phoebe  All right well lets see, Ross is a good father, but Joey has a
boatThis is hard!
Joey  This is crazy! Hey look, I wanna switch to Rachel!
Ross  Ooh, I wanna switch to Rachel too!
Phoebe  No wait! JustOkayJust wait! You guys! Wait you guys!
Dont make any rash decisions, okay? Just remember my promise, when we get married,
three times a week.
Rachel  Oh God, Phoebe!
Phoebe  (To Rachel) Im talking about massages.
Rachel  Oh.
Rachel  Okay, yknow what?! I know-I know how to settle this! All right
here, this is what were gonna do! Im gonna write Joey on one napkin (does so)
and Im gonna right Ross on the other napkin (does so) and we are going to pick one!
And that person is going to be our backup! Okay?
Joey  Okay thats fair.
Ross  All right.
Phoebe  Good!
Rachel  Pick one.
Phoebe  Left! (Rachel hands her the napkin in her left hand and they both unfold
and read them.) Thank you.
Rachel  Youre welcome.
Phoebe  (reading) Ross!
Rachel  (reading) Joey! (Pause) We should just switch.
Phoebe  Yeah absolutely! (They both switch.)
Joey  Yeah.
[Scene  Richards Apartment, Monica is looking around and notices an African mask
hanging on the wall.]
Monica  (to the mask) I missed you-you ugly, flat faced old freak!
Richard  Excuse me?
Monica  Oh! (Laughs and points at the mask.) Him.
Richard  Oh. (Laughs.) Whew!
Monica  I missed this apartment! Now, this is a grown-ups apartment!
Yknow, I-I should be with a grown-up, do you know what I mean?!
Richard  Yeah! Youre saying, you need to be with someone more mature.
Maybe someone with, a license to practice medicine. Or a mustache.
Monica  Yknow, lets face it, Im not a kid anymore! I-I need to
be with someone who-who wants the same things that I do! I mean coming to my place of work
and telling me that you love me, I want that! Talking about pig sex over lunch, I dont
want that!
Richard  I think thats fair.
Monica  Fair? Please dont even talk to me about fair! Fair wouldve
been you wanting to marry me back then! Or fair wouldve been Chandler wanting to
marry me now! Believe me, nothing about this is fair! Nothing! Nothing! Nothing!
Nothing! Nothing! Nothing! Nothing! Nothing! Nothing! Nothing!
Richard  Its okay! Shh! Hey. Hey. (Hugs her) Shhhh.
Monica  Nothing. (She backs away a little bit but is still in his arms and looks
up at his eyes.) I dont knUmm. I dont know. Umm
Richard  I know. (Backs away.)
Monica  Yknow, I-I I have to figuresome stYknow,
some stuff before I can
Richard  Yeah, I understand. Take as much time as you want. (Pause) Ten, even
twenty minutes if you need it. Ill be here. Not smoking. (Monica leaves.)
[Scene  Richards Apartment, time lapse. Richard is smoking as he hears a knock on
the door. He quickly puts out his cigar and opens the door.]
Richard  Chandler.
Chandler  Where is she? Im not scared of you! (Averts his eyes and walks
in.)
Richard  Shes not here and please come in.
Chandler  (examining the coffee table) Scotch on the rocks, with a twist, on a
coaster? Ha-ha, Monica! Monica!
Richard  Okay, she was here, but she left.
Chandler  Well where did she go?
Richard  Well she said she had to think things over.
Chandler  Oh my God, I cant believe this! Yknow, I thoughtI
thought you were a good guy.
Richard  Oh, hey look nothing happened.
Chandler  Nothing happened? Nothing? So you didnt tell my girlfriend that
you love her?
Richard  Well all right, one thing happened?
Chandler  Yknow what? I cant believe this! Do you know what you did?
My girlfriend is out there thinking things over! You made my girlfriend think!!
Richard  Well Im sorry.
Chandler  And what does she have to think about? I love her!
Richard  Well, apparently Im willing to offer her things that you are not.
Chandler  But I am willing to offer her all those things. This was just a
plan, yknow? A way to throw her off course so that when I offered her all these
things, shed be surprised!
Richard  Well if it helps, it worked very well.
Chandler  It was working until you showed up, you big tree! I mean, this
isnt fair. You had your chance with her! You had your chance and you blew it! And
this is my chance and I am not going to blow it because we are meant for each
other! And this is all just been one stupid mistake! (Sits down heavily.) I was gonna
propose tonight.
Richard  You were gonna propose? (Sits on the arm of the couch.)
Chandler  Yeah I even (pause) got a ring. (Puts in on the center cushion.) Did
you get a ring?
Richard  No I dont have a ring! (Pause) You go get her Chandler. (Pause)
And can I give you a piece of advice? If you do get her, dont let her go. Trust me.
Chandler  Yknow Richardyou are a good guy.
Richard  I know. (Pause) I hate that!
[Scene  The Hallway, Chandler is running up the stairs and towards his apartment, but
Joey is taking out the garbage at the same time and stops him in the hall.]
Joey  Dude!
Chandler  I cant talk to you now, I gotta find Monica!
Joey  Shes gone.
Chandler  What?
Joey  Shes gone. She had a bag and she left.
Chandler  What are you talking about?
Joey  She was all crying. She-she said you guys want different things, and that
and that she needed time to think.
Chandler  Well why didnt you stop her?! Why didnt you just tell her
it was a plan?!
Joey  I-I did! I told her everything, Chandler! But she wouldnt believe
me.
Chandler  Well where Where did she go?
Joey  To her parents I think and she said you shouldnt call her. But
if I were you I would.
Chandler  I cant believe I ruined this.
Joey  I am so sorry man.
Monica  You wanted it to be a surprise.
Chandler  Oh my God.
Monica  Chandler In all my life I never thought I would be so lucky.
(Starting to cry.) As tofall in love with my bestmy best Theres a
reason why girls dont do this!
Chandler  Okay! (He joins her on one knee) Okay! Okay! Oh God, I thought
(Starting to cry, pauses) Wait a minute, I-I can do this. (Pause) I thought that it
mattered what I said or where I said it. Then I realized the only thing that matters is
that you, (Pause) you make me happier than I ever thought I could be. (Starting to cry
again.) And if youll let me, I will spend the rest of my life trying to make you
feel the same way. (Pause as he gets out the ring.) Monica, will you marry me?
Monica  Yes.
Monica  I knew you were likely to take a wife!
Joey  (yelling through the door) Can we come it yet?! Were dying out here!
Monica  Come in! Come in! (Joey, Rachel, and Phoebe burst through the door.)
Were engaged!!!
Rachel  Ohhh, this is the least jealous Ive ever been!
Phoebe  Oh no wait no, this is wrong! Ross isnt here!
Monica  Oh
Rachel  Oh hell, hes done this three times! He knows what its about!
Joey  Yeah!
[Scene  Monica, Chandler, and Phoebe's, its just Monica and Chandler dancing to Wonderful
Tonight on the Slowhand album by Eric Clapton. And you can buy that album from
